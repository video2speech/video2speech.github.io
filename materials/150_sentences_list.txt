Then that's all you had to say.
Where did he go?
He was just here.
It's just you.
Why didn't you tell me?
So I did it.
I don't get you.
Can we go now?
What do you think?
Where've you been?
And where're you going?
That's what I just said
What'd you do to her?
Then go get her
So what does that give me?
What've you got for me?
And why would I do that?
How'd you do it?
It's about time.
I'm on it
I'll get right on it.
I want you to go out with her.
What'd he say?
You think this'll work?
I have no say at all.
You could always go with me.
He always look so
What was it like?
It wasn't like that.
It's just something I had.
Because I don't want to.
You know what I mean
You up for it?
It's not that bad
What are you doing here?
Oh so now you think you know me?
I should do this.
No you weren't
You know what they say
Why 're you doing this?
You're not okay.
Why don't you?
That's what you want isn't it?
I know a lot more than that
You don't know what you want.
Or do I have some time to think about it?
That's where we can help you.
Did I have anything to say about it?
What is it now?
But you're never here!
How could I be?
Is it not so?
What does he say?
This time with me!
There'll be a time.
I want to go with you!
What do you see?
Look what they did!
And if you don't I will.
I cannot be other than I am.
Have you anything to say?
We don't need to know.
What's he doing?
You tell that to them!
You don't know anything!
You think I don't know that?
Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
That's what he did to me.
Give me another one please.
Why you're here.
Say yes or no.
No he is here.
I was all of these.
I'm coming with him.
Yes come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
What do you need?
I have your money.
What are you doing?
I'll make some for us.
You don't know.
That's not me.
I had no money.
You know these people?
I didn't see anything.
Did you take one too?
They were just here.
Did you tell him you did?
You know I don't know.
That's how you help her.
And I get more done because of it.
Is that all there is?
But what if it does?
You might need my help.
I'll come with you.
Well just so you know.
You can do what you want.
No what is it?
You know what that is right?
What do you want?
I'll do that.
Tell me what you want to say.
What am I going to do with you?
You could give me something.
Now's not a good time.
We don't know.
There's a lot to be done.
It doesn't work that way.
You'll be my first.
Is he with you?
This all you want?
No I don't get that!
Look - here we are!
Why do you say I and not we?
But what good is money there?
Oh - I got it.
What does it look like?
I'll do it.
We have no money.
Just do what I do.
Say the same thing I say.
Yes the money is good.
Where's the money?
What do you mean you know?
What are you coming here to do?
How do you know one another?
I'll take him.
Look I don't have time for you get out of my way!
Aren't you tired?
Don't you get it?
Look I'm in here.
How could I know.
I hope we can.
It's the last one.
I don't know.
How's it going?
Yes I don't know what to make of it.
Well that's something.
Yes I thought so.
Okay come on down.
Yes I know that.
Well what is it?
Well I have to go now.
Well how's it going back there?
Oh thank you very much.
Yes I think so.
Yes really thank you very much.
What do you mean?
Oh no thank you.
Is there anything we can do for you?
It's the only thing I know.
Just do what I say okay?
I'd do it but I got to go.
And I don't think I will.
No you don't.
It's your money.
Got all my money.
Yeah I see her.
He's going to need it.
Just tell me about the money.
You have a good time?
I'll think about it.
Didn't work out that way.
I didn't have the time.
You couldn't get to him?
I don't like it.
I want it back.
Doesn't look like it.
Who are all these?
I'll help you out.
I think you do know where he is.
That's what I always say.
What do I know?
How do you know?
I can see that.
I don't know when I can get there.
I'm not like you.
That's the way I see it too.
What do you want to know?
I make you feel good.
You make me feel good.
What'd you do?
How would you know?
I didn't do anything.
I can get you the money.
I'll got your money to you.
Not bad not bad.
That's what I thought.
Thank you very much.
So you do know her.
He's a she!
What are we going to do?
Now all we need is a way to get there.
What's she doing?
I need to know.
I don't know!
I don't need one.
How do I look?
What did you say?
What did you do?
I'll be right back.
One to the right.
What was he like?
I'm not going.
Why would you need me?
There is no need for me other than this.
You can do it!
How does it work?
No not at all!
Do I look bad?
I'll be right with you.
What's going on?
She's all I've got.
I don't know what to say
Look where we are.
I couldn't do that.
I'm on my way.
We've been all through that.
It was just something I was doing for money.
Because we're going there.
I want to know.
Okay we'll come back to that.
I know what you did.
Yeah who's this?
You'll get it when we get there.
He did it because he could.
Yes I do have something to say.
It's not my money.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
would I be if I didn't go with you?
You don't need to be here.
How much do you make now?
How will I get it to you?
I've thought about it and there's no other way.
I didn't know what to think.
I have to tell you something.
There wasn't one.
We're all like that.
There wasn't anything like that.
It got to be too much for him.
Why do you think he did it?
Want to know what it's really like?
I'll do what I can.
Okay I'll take it all.
Was it a bad one?
I don't want to.
It's okay we're just about there.
I want to help you.
You don't really get it.
I don't think so.
Is there something we can do?
So what's up?
I don't get it.
You're just tired.
We're with you.
Well I've thought about it.
No you're not.
How come you don't think about me?
How did you know that?
Don't do that!
I've got to go.
No I'm not.
What do you think I'm doing?
How's he doing it?
What's that got to do with it?
Where are you going?
There's a lot to tell.
I thought about that.
Oh what's that?
Aren't you going in?
But if they do?
He'll be all right.
I'm with you!
You know - it is?
Why don't you go back up and -
I think you're right.
A lot of people think like that.
Is there any way out of it?
Why do you say that?
That's what I said!
It'll be all right.
All right - go to it.
I'll be another!
Well I'll be - !
But I'm okay.
I know about that.
He's on to us!
Just say it that's all.
You'll get your money.
If you get it?
What do you mean I got money?
I know you did.
So we'll get what you want.
What do you want then?
What do you say?
It's bad for you.
Are we going in this?
Come and get you!
She said she'd come and get me.
I don't want to be here.
I don't like it here.
It's not that.
To us it was.
Why do they do that?
They're still out.
You two don't you get it?
What do I have to do for it?
You don't know how bad or anything?
How would I know?
Got here just in time.
What have I done?
She'll be right out.
Where is she now?
I know who it is.
Did you tell them?
That we were coming?
Work it out with her tell her how you feel.
You don't mean that.
How's she doing?
No he's out now.
It don't look right.
I don't know you.
You don't know me.
You don't know me!
You think you can take me now?
You want me to get her?
You got something to say say it!
That's what you think.
It wasn't me.
I did didn't I?
No no I haven't.
Don't think about it.
No it's okay.
Do you see them?
Okay it's on.
I'll take you all the way in.
I'm doing what I can.
We don't know that.
Can we do that?
Where are we now?
We're not going to make it.
why did they do that?
She's right here.
I mean they're people.
What do you want with us?
Yes I'll do it.
You'll do it?
I'll be back.
We're right here.
Don't take it.
Did you feel that?
I have to get in there.
That's the way I want it.
If that's the way you want it.
It's all here!
I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's how I want them.
What should I say?
We don't have much time.
I'll take a look at it.
Can I be of some help?
That's very nice of you.
Yeah something like that but as I say they didn't have time to tell me very much.
No one that I know of.
What did he have?
Could you come and take a look at them?
I don't have time now.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Yeah I think he is.
Can you do something please?
Would you go up please?
I wouldn't know anything about it.
She did did she?
He's not here.
You look very good.
No he's not.
I know that look.
Where did he get it?
What was that about?
I didn't get a good look at him.
Where'd you get this?!
Yeah that's it.
That was a good one.
Why'd I do what?
Why did you do it?
She didn't know him.
You need this for anything?
I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
That's all I know.
What about the other one?
Did you know him?
That's the way these people are.
Don't tell me what to think.
How can I go?
What'll you need?
That's not what I mean.
I hope you're right.
Just go would you.
It's all I could get.
There's no way!
Look we don't know what's going on out there.
How do you feel?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!
I only work here.
He's coming in.
We'd know about it.
They'll get us.
But they don't know that.
They're in here.
They're right on us.
Just get back here!
Think of a way.
Yes there are aren't there.
I know they would.
Because I don't have to.
Look I can see where this is going.
What does he look like?
I want to be in it.
How do you like it?
No no no no.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I want to go!
He's all right.
How much is it?
We need money now.
You're not going to do this?
How much will you give him now?
And then you think you can -
What does she want?
Tell them to go!
I don't need them.
All they want to see is your work.
Well don't do that again!
No they will not.
Just say it - you'll see.
You've been doing it for years.
Now we are going back.
No he doesn't.
And I don't want you here.
Well thank you very much.
You can go now.
It's up to you.
I have other things you might like.
You see he doesn't know I'm here.
How can I help you?
Oh yes and who are you?
He's not in.
He said to tell you.
And so you do!
Do you know who I am?
Well look at them.
Well there it is.
Would you tell me why?
It's very good.
So then you like it?
Well what is it about?
Yes what about him?
I'll do anything you say!
I thought I did.
They get in the way.
She had to go - yes!
Yes she's like that.
Is she not here?
Why are you here?
You don't know what it's like.
Where does he work?
Does he work at all?
Can I see it?
What have you got for me?
Put it down I said!
So there you are.
What did he say?
What can I do for you?
Who do you think it is?
I'm not tired at all.
Do you have it?
And that's it.
Yes yes - go on.
Do you have me?
And that's all?
Do you have that?
Tell me what is this work?
Can I - could I help you in any way?
No it's him!
Do you mean that?
You're so good to me.
You mean she's not coming back?
I have to get back.
You're not well.
Did my work please you?
How could I not?
It was good of you to come.
I know I know.
Why didn't they come?
Did you like it at all?
But what is it they don't like?
I don't know why.
You are the first to know.
I don't have to tell you how much I need your help.
Did you like it then?
What does that mean?
No you didn't!
How does one do that?
Oh yes yes yes yes yes!
Go on tell me!
That is all you need to know.
You cannot say that!
All the same why him?
You know who that is?
Oh I know that!
What about this little thing?
I know a little.
I'm here only for you.
Well I don't know!
What do you mean - now?
What does he want?
She didn't say.
But he's all right?
Can we come in?
How did he look?
But it's something to do.
Yes I should think so.
Is he all right?
I've got to do something!
I don't know why I feel so good.
But you know what?
Yeah I do but go to work.
It's nice to see you.
Yeah I would think so too.
I would think so.
What do I think?
Will you be all right?
Will you think about it?
Will you come with me?
Can I get you something?
Do you like it?
Well all right then be that way.
Yes I should think.
You did did you?
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh come on tell us.
No but we're about to.
What are you going to see?
What time is it?
I really don't know.
I didn't mean it.
You don't have to say anything.
You've got to know.
So you know what she does?
This is too much.
Nice to see you.
Are you going to help me up?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Could be a lot of things.
Well I like it here.
Oh I don't know.
Come in come in.
Tell him I'm out.
What can I get you?
I'll tell you why.
I want to know why .
I was the first one to see it.
Where do you think I've been?
What good will that do?
That's what good it will do!
You know what you can do with that!
Come on take a look at this!
Do anything you want with it.
There's one way you can get it.
What do you mean help?
That's all very well.
I'll tell you.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Get out get out!
What was she doing there?
Why I couldn't do that .
That don't do us any good.
I haven't got it.
Don't you know?
Not when you are there.
Yes yes it does.
Not bad not bad at all.
Do you know something?
Here here here now!
Don't you go back to work on me too.
Now get out of here!
Well that's too bad.
I feel all right too.
That's all there is to it.
What have I done now?
Well look who's here!
It's not for you.
Where is he now?
They think he did it!
What are we going to do about it?
Why I don't know.
I haven't any.
But I haven't .
She was wasn't she?
All you've got to do is
Now come on tell me.
Now come on I know you didn't do it.
A lot of them didn't think you would.
It's all right.
What's she got to do with you?
He had no more to do with it than you did.
If he can do it yes.
What's going on here?
Don't you think I know it?
What'll we do?
What did you do with it?
Oh is that so?
What time was it?
Then where were you?
What time did you get in?
I didn't do it!
Now you tell us.
He's not bad at it.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
Never a good thing.
Because we were good at it?
She got two of them.
All right all right.
Why didn't you just say so?
It got to you didn't it.
You need it now.
And we're good at it.
How'd it go out here?
How'd it go in there?
Didn't think you would.
That just might work.
So what was he?
I've got you.
I had to see you.
You shouldn't be up.
We want to help.
That's what I would have done.
That's nice to know.
Didn't help much.
How can that be?
How did you know?
They are not the same thing.
Oh no I would have done that.
You wouldn't have done that?
Is it a what?
You like it there don't you?
I have to go.
It's not that nice.
I've thought about that.
You can have them.
I don't think it would work.
You don't have to work.
We should do it.
Don't come back.
I think you should go now.
I mean yes I did.
Can I help you?
It's just not.
That was you wasn't it?
It's not me.
They don't know that.
What are I doing?
You're right I should go.
I know I should go.
I don't know Not really.
Where do you want to go?
You don't like this I take it?
I'll make them.
And what should I say?
I really don't.
What do you think I do?
So what do you do?
I'm at work all the time.
Oh I get it.
Coming all the way up here but you know.
I thought that was you.
Does he do this all the time?
Don't tell him you're here.
So who was he with?
I'll be there.
I'm with you on that one.
That's not what I've got.
I didn't know that.
Don't you know this?
Do you feel that way?
How well did you know him?
Oh no I'm okay.
No I'm okay.
Do you know that?
I'll help you.
From people who do work?
I know that I know that.
You're not what?
Why don't you get another one?
How did you get it?
Oh well you know.
You know what he's like.
You know what I mean.
To tell her how I feel about you.
It's what they said it is.
What did you see in there?
I know how to get in there.
I think we should just go.
It's the way he said it.
Not like him is it?
Can you help me?
I feel the same way.
I hope you know what you mean to me.
Not just because of what you're doing.
Because of who you are.
It's going well!
You look a little tired.
Take a look at this.
I look at you and see the things that got me here.
When would we come?
I want him to like me.
I think you should go.
Now what are we doing?
Please don't go.
Does he know you know?
You'll come up with something.
I know what he did to you.
You thought about it too.
But not right now.
What've you got there?
No I know what you mean.
You can go back and make it all work.
Did I say something?
Some of us who got to good at this?
I could get it out of him.
What's the other?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Just where you'd never think to look for him.
We'll be there.
I have something to tell you.
You go get help.
What do we do now?
Give it to me.
All right I get it.
I'll tell him.
I didn't see that one coming.
Oh yes you are.
I don't know how to put this really.
You didn't see a thing!
We've got a lot of work to do.
What do we have?
Yes what is it?
You just don't get it do you?
You always do that!
I just don't see it.
And how do you feel about that?
You don't say.
Would that I could say the Same.
I might as well.
Have a look at this.
Here have one of these.
You didn't tell her?
Aren't you coming?
I thought you didn't.
Is that what you think?
Not that I know of.
Is there anything that isn't?
Did he say who?
Why should they think that?
I might say the same.
I wasn't about to.
Not me you should thank.
Do you really think so?
Please don't get up.
I know all this.
We know one thing.
Oh yes I did.
If you say so.
I'm good at it.
I'll go with you.
You've had it.
She'll always be.
See that down there?
Oh come on just a little.
But how can I do that?
Do it for me.
Then why are you coming back to me?
Here's a thought.
Now what do you want to do about it?
I don't want that.
I want to be with you.
Have a good time.
Wouldn't think of it.
I got something for that.
Well what do you think?
That's more like it.
What can I tell you?
I'll take some.
What can I be doing for you?
Just go out there.
I see you're right.
Be good for you.
How are we doing?
What can I do?
What are you going to do about it?
How'd it go?
Why didn't you go for it just now?
This isn't right.
Where'd she go?
Not with this one.
What are we going to do about this?
I put it there!
And I didn't do it.
What have you got to do?
Well you know what?
I really should get back.
Where did he tell you that?
And what if there'd been two?
It's my way.
So that's it?
Doesn't work on you.
Well look what we have here.
It doesn't go like that.
What'll you do?
I don't know anything about it.
What have you been up to?
That's how you know him.
Who's doing this?
Why should I take you back?
You think I did?
So what do you want me to do?
No it couldn't.
You think you're the first?
I don't want you in my way.
Are you still here?
And you know what?
Do you have to do that?
How'd you know?
He never does it right.
When was the last time?
You always have to be right.
I know he's out but how's he doing?
I just thought I should say I don't know something.
How's he doing?
You don't know him.
Didn't think you'd make it.
I got something for you.
So what are you doing here?
I've been bad.
It's still my money.
I want my money.
Never any other way.
I don't got it.
Do you have the money?
I'm on it.
Need I say more.
Can you do this for me?
So now I see where you're coming from.
What do you do?
What do I do?
So that's what you been doing?
You might be right.
That can be done.
You know what that is don't you?
What about in the mean time?
We was coming to see you.
What do I have to do?
Well do something about it.
Don't you people get it?
Do you want it that much.
You can have that.
That's so tired.
I want you take it there.
You know how I know?
What is it you want from me?
Where do you go from here?
So what's up with you?
The first and only time.
Please don't go there.
Why'd you do that?
It's all good.
Is that good or bad?
What do you want me to say?
How can this be?
Oh is that what I'm doing?
I'm doing okay.
Where are you from?
That's the way I want to feel about my work.
How do you see all of this?
I don't know who I am.
That's what I like about you and me.
And so I am.
I have said all there is to be said.
It will come out well for me.
You will do as you please.
Have you had one?
Well then I'll tell you what I'd do.
What is to be done?
When is he to go?
What do we do?
We can still come out of this okay.
He's too good.
Oh you don't?
Well why didn't you say so?
Tell me about them.
What do you like then?
I just don't like it.
How do you know that?
Is that what I did now?
No did he tell you about it?
Why didn't you come?
What don't you know?
If not you then who?
It's not in me.
What do you think of that?
Tell me what I can do.
But he was a lot of other things too.
Think it'll work?
What are you doing out here?
But I don't think so.
What if I don't want it?
No I didn't.
Yeah I could've.
Didn't really work out.
You want to tell me what's going on?
We should tell him we're not going.
It will and you know why?
But you didn't see it right?
You think he did it?
There's only one I want.
You just have to tell me who she is.
He's still here.
I'll tell you all about it.
Can I see him?
It's good to see you.
I can get it.
I thank you for your time.
What did she look like?
And I like you.
What did she say?
So what do you say?
You don't like it?
What do you want Will?
Who do you want me to be?
That's all I do Will.
Oh so you know.
I said this isn't how I go.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
This isn't how I go.
You think I'm up for it?
Did you do any of that?
I can tell them as well as you can.
Go out with me.
So what are you up to now?
Look I don't know how much you want to know about any of this.
And you're Will.
I could feel it.
Is he going to be okay?
Look I know why you like him.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
You need to go.
It's more than they thought.
Do you know who that is?
No it's not.
Just the same as you two.
Yes Will I do.
You didn't need to do that.
You just didn't.
How did you get here?
Yeah it was okay.
No I don't.
You know what for.
No I haven't.
We'll go down there.
I'll give him money.
What does he want.
What do you want ?
Tell me what he said.
Yes it's okay.
This is for you.
I need to know who you are first please.
What does it mean?
Tell me about it.
This will be my last one.
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know why I said that.
Well what have you got?
You don't have to say anything
So what did you want?
He will come back.
But you know so what?
I said I don't have any.
I don't have any money.
Give me some money.
You don't have to do this.
So what are you going to do?
I don't want to know.
I didn't know what to do.
Can I come in?
That'd be nice.
Well that's good.
You didn't have to do this.
I don't know what to do.
I know about how she was like.
This don't feel right.
That's just not good.
And this how you do me!
And that's what you did.
I mean that's it.
No you do it.
I know you didn't.
Tell me what to do.
I'm here with you.
Well get to it.
What do you know how to make?
Now you get up!
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!
Do me like this you mean?
Why you say that?
I just know how you get.
That's what she said.
And tell him how you feel.
You could put it that way.
I'm a what?
Just about anything you know.
You know how I get.
I'll be okay.
Don't do that.
Can you see that?
I know I did.
You need money again?
What'd I tell you?
You got any money?
I don't think he'd feel it.
I didn't know.
What'd you say?
That's what they say.
What are they doing now?
What'd she say?
If you give me one.
What's that for?
I couldn't tell.
You don't have to come.
Did I say that?
How'd you get this?
I don't that's all.
I'd like that.
Tell them I'm not.
Don't give him any more.
Then take it from him.
What if I say no?
They want him first.
Then we can have him.
Because I want you to tell me.
Do you know what this is?
I don't have to.
If I say no?
Why tell me this?
Then go get him.
Put it this way.
But not to last.
And what can he do for you?
You could help us.
Well no not really.
I want to do it.
What's going on down there?
If you don't we will.
Okay here it is.
She's not with you?
You didn't like her!
I didn't like her.
When might that be?
I know all that.
I'm coming to that.
Are you with me?
I like you too.
I'll but you one.
What'll you have?
I think I have no money.
So how are you doing?
But if you could?
Why didn't you go?
I didn't say that.
What did she want?
And who do I go to about you?
You know what I think?
Because it's not.
How are you doing?
What do you want me to do?
I think you need more help than you've got.
Why should I be?
You know where I been.
She didn't know?
I'm tired of this.
How do you know I'm not?
But how come I'd be there?
Is that why you're still here?
I don't have one.
You would like her very much!
No I'm not!
Very well thank you.
How do you do?
Well isn't he?
Well you should be!
And what do I say?
No it's not!
It's that way!
It's in there.
I wouldn't know.
This is for me.
I'm going to need all of this!
Why not go to work for me?
Why does it never work out?
Why doesn't it never work out?
What have you been doing?
Don't do it!
Why are you doing that?
So here take it back.
I thought I'd never see you again!
And that's it?
I've got two of him!
Yes I'm right?
Oh that's nice.
Why doesn't it?
No you get out of here.
Get out of here!
Will you be back?
Would you like some money?
I've got to go now.
Are you all right?
Well do we just go on up?
Then why go there?
He's out there!
Can I have them?
I know what you mean!
I'll be right back!
That's why little things mean so much to him.
I just don't want to.
Well you're right.
When did we get it from them?
You've been very very nice.
I don't see anything!
How much are they?
Well we're here to help!
We have to go.
Then we'll be back to get you.
I just hope this is still good up there.
I'll be all right.
I'll go up.
A nice one I hope.
You know I don't think so.
I have to go!
I can be anything you want me to be!
We're not going to make do.
We'll make do.
So what do we do now?
Yes yes it is!
If we still have one.
Well we'll be going up in two years.
We'll know then.
What a thing to say!
What are you doing back here?
I think it's just right.
Now it's time.
We'll do this again!
Well put it down and come in!
Where did you go?
I like to think so.
And what do you do?
Give it back to him.
What do you want to do with it?
You did the right thing.
What are you going to do?
Please don't tell me that!
What's it to you?
What's that mean?
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.
You don't see that?
That's all he'll say.
Yeah that's it!
This is all I have.
Oh here they are.
Yes it's me!!!
You're all through with this now?
No not at all.
Okay come on in.
Why do you do it?
Anything you can tell me?
It's on my way.
Where have you been?
Yeah it's me.
There's so much I want to tell you.
I do I do.
Did you know that?
That wouldn't be too good would it?
Do you want to do bad things?
I'm doing it.
What do you want to do?
Or do you just want me?
Are you in with them?
You think you know so much.
There you go again.
You can make it.
Who's it you mean.
Why are you here.
Don't say that.
I didn't mean it or did I?
Yes I like you.
Do you like me?
Do you like the way I feel?
I'll go then.
I don't like that.
Do you like that?
I I don't know.
What do you want from me?
NO you come on.
I want to see you.
That's what I said.
I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Just to see if I could do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!!!
Oh yeah that's good.
You'll see I'll get you.
No way get out.
He didn't mean it.
If you want to.
You want to see him too right?
He had to have her.
To make her do things.
I don't want to go.
It would be too much for him.
No you're right.
Yes I'm going.
What was that all about?
You didn't tell him about me?
Yeah but I don't think it's going to do much good.
What am I going to do?
I mean a little you know.
You want to tell me about it?
What did you see?
Well how did it go?
I'll see you.
It'll be okay.
What do want me to do?
You really want to do this don't you?
Now how are you going to do that?
There is very little for you to do but I do need your help.
I'm here aren't I?
Do you know anything?
That's too bad.
What are you doing now?
I just know that's all.
Yeah how did you know?
I mean it now.
That's just not the way things are done.
What did you do?!
Where'd you get them?
Well you know how it is with him.
I'll see what I can do.
Know anything about that?
So what do you think?
Did you tell him?
Oh you're good.
I don't know they just always need it.
Well we didn't get any help on that.
Don't have much on him.
He was the only one done right.
Really want to know?
and think about it.
We have to go now.
This is the last time I'll see you.
If you think about it it's all you can do really.
I'll help them.
They would never do that.
I didn't see.
Don't look at me!
What's he in for?
What can I say?
So how is it in there?
What'd he get?
I'll get him.
I'll see you there.
It's going back down.
He was all right.
I don't think you will.
Get out of the way.
What time did he say to be here?
I want you to look at this.
When'd you get back?
That's what she is!
No one to back me up.
She doesn't need to know.
I know we can.
I don't think we can do that.
Would of been nice.
Why don't you come with us.
Well I didn't do it did I?
What were you going to do?
When'd he tell you?
Get back to me on that one.
I'll say it.
I'll just say it.
Is it back in?
But he didn't say anything.
That's not bad.
Did you see that?
There's just not time for it.
Would they do that?
He's not there.
And there was no one there to help me.
Why'd you want to help us?
It's what you are.
I mean I don't think about it all the time.
What's it all about?
How'd he do?
How does that feel?
You I can work with.
I don't know anything.
Where's he going?
Where'd they come from?
Did he see us?
What's he doing here?
I don't know about that.
How's it look back there?
What you been up to?
I know it's not.
I'm going back.
What do you mean get back?
We'll have to see when we get back.
There were more than that.
How much is there?
Did we get it?
He doesn't get it.
The money and the people.
I'm going to take a look at this.
I know that now.
What did I say?
You should take a look.
As much as I want.
So who's going to know?
And I don't see it like that.
This is no good.
Good to see you.
What can we do?
Why did he go that way?
Had to be done.
It was just money.
Did he say anything to you?
So what's he doing?
And what about her?
I think I do.
Where's he now?
It had to be done.
To know about it?
I had to tell you right?
And it's still going on.
I have to go now.
You know I'm not.
I would want to know.
She really did that?
I mean for us.
I don't know who that is.
I like it here.
What if it's not who you think it is?
I'll come back.
I don't mean that.
So when was I here?
Why are you here then?
They know it's you!
How do they know that?
How can they know any of that?
They know you were here.
They don't know what it is but they know!
Don't need it.
Okay how do you want to do it?
I want to come in.
We need to get in there.
Is he coming in?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do.
He's coming for us.
And why is that?
For what he'd been through?
Look what do you want me to say?
You're coming with us.
And what about you anything?
Here's what I've got.
What are they doing?
I know he will.
I said LOOK AT ME!
We're going too.
This is the only way.
Good to see you again.
I will be with you like this.
And I'll come again.
It's not you.
I need you so much!
And I with you.
How do you know this?
It does me good to see you.
And so would I.
I want what you want!
Now what do we do?
How much time have I got?
These things take time.
What could he do?
What were you doing with that?
You'll like him.
Please can we go?
But I'm not so bad am I?
What did it look like?
For you to help me.
What do you see now?
Where are you now?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
I just thought you should know.
I never thought you would.
I've been where you've been.
Nice to see you too.
Now's the only time!
It's not the time.
Something's not right.
Why are you doing all this for me?
I don't know what to say.
Things are going okay.
I never thought I'd see you again.
How've you been?
Been there done that.
Where did we all go?
But it didn't.
What do you need it for?
So we'll see.
That would be all right wouldn't it?
Does he know that?
It was much more than we thought to get here.
How did you get in here?
Yes I come I will do it.
That's all right.
Do you know where they are?
And you never will.
But what about us?
But it's all right isn't it?
All right I will.
I've got them right here.
Get them for me.
You'd say anything now to get what you want.
How did you get in?
You'll be there.
Well you can tell me now.
Why did you come back?
I know so very little about you.
Who are you really?
What did you do and what did you think?
When will he be back?
Yes Yes I know.
You know what I have been doing.
You see here we are again.
We'll come again.
What is it you want?
Yes much too good a time.
You see what I mean?
I see what you mean.
It's very good to be here.
Well I was right.
You didn't come here to tell me this.
Oh how do you do?
He'll take one.
I'd like to get it back.
You would like to be on it?
That's not so bad.
I'll have another please.
One in one out.
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.
I'm always going on about me me me.
They'll never see you.
They're never going to see you.
They'll be back.
You don't know where you are.
that was the last one.
Want to come in?
I had to come.
What will you do?
No one back here does.
I didn't want to.
I would have done the same thing.
I thought you might have.
Right back you said you'd be right back.
Be who you are right now.
There isn't any us.
But I have to go.
Tell me all of it.
I just want out of here.
Yes yes he did.
If you say you are.
I don't have it.
It's still you.
I need to do it.
That's what we do.
That's what it's about.
That's all there is.
Are we on or not?
Just give me the money now.
But I might not have.
I know who you mean.
Do you think she'll be all right?
Please don't make me say it again.
What do you want me to do ?
That would be doing something wouldn't it?
We wouldn't want to do something.
Well we have to help her!
She doesn't feel she can do that.
That's not all there is to it!
That's all there is to it then.
What will be okay?
It will be okay.
Do you want me to go?
I know this was right.
That's what I'd come here for.
I know where you can go.
I've been through this.
I know what you've been doing.
Well they aren't.
I thought they might take me.
But did you know him?
I don't have any time.
It'll take a little time.
They wouldn't take me.
Where'd she get you?
If you want I can help you.
They is good for you!
What should I do now?
I'll get this.
You do it then.
He doesn't like it.
I don't know it.
I'd like to go with you.
I know more than I want to know about it.
What do you know about it?
I know how to do it.
We don't know what he is.
I don't want to know him!
Do you know him?
Look at this one!
That's what we say all right.
We don't need no help.
Where do you think you're going?
It's more like what aren't I doing.
Then there it is.
We were back on.
They were right there for you.
She was right there for you!
I was doing it for them.
What do they get?
Isn't it always?
It's all about the money isn't it?
Now that'll be something.
What do you want us to do about it?
We're going to give him the money back?
That's how good he is.
We can still do this!
You'll be there?
She's up for it.
She up for this?
You know what we're doing with the money.
He's not coming back.
What do you need from me?
It's all take take take.
But what can I say?
Take it from me you never do.
Because it is all about the money right?
I want you to have it.
It should have been you.
So there it is.
What about the money?
I don't know who you are!
Not the way I did it.
How do you know I will?
You'll know what to do.
It's more than that.
It's what I do.
I know where it is.
A lot like that one.
What's up with you?
You going to have the time?
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here.
So what do you have for me?
What do you get out of it?
What's he going to do?
But you know that.
But I know where I am.
I'll take you up on that.
Is it that bad?
You don't need to work.
Why don't you come?
I thought it was you.
Why did you take the money?
How did you know I was here?
But not with you.
There's no hope in it.
Is that the way you feel now?
I don't like it at all.
What do I mean to you?
I take it back.
How did it go?
What's the time?
I've got something to tell you.
I can get another.
You shouldn't have done that.
Where did you get it?
That's what you need isn't it?
Well I've got something for you.
I need the money too.
But if it does.
I've come to know you.
It'll never work.
But you can now.
I couldn't help you.
You know where I'm from?
Coming up to two years now.
But what could I do?
I don't think I know that one.
I don't know where it is.
What do you have for us now.
Why don't you have more time?
I'm coming in now.
I like it up here.
Are you still there?
It didn't work?
That's not why we're here.
Don't look down.
Where're we going?
I shouldn't do this.
What's with you?
But don't feel bad.
Can you help me get her back?
I couldn't get to her.
I need your help.
That's what you were put here for.
What's in it for you?
You said you could help.
How much do you know?
You need to get out more.
But I had to see you.
We've been through all this.
How do I know you didn't?
And now they don't.
But she does work here?
You don't want to.
And so should you.
Just give it to me.
How's this about me?
Here's your money.
You get anything on them?
That's all I got.
Now you got something for me or not?
Only one I can think of.
You get it when I get her.
And why should she?
She's as much as said so.
He'll never look there!
I know how we can get in!
I thought it was a nice thing to do.
It doesn't mean anything.
Please tell me you have'm!
I think that you did it.
Now they think I did it.
You have to do something for me first.
Where did you come from?
How can you do that?
What'd you do!
It isn't a good time.
I know she's here.
Will you come see her with me?
I mean will you GO with me?
Will you go with me?
I just don't get this.
I can tell her anything.
A lot of people.
I can see him right now!
You've done it again?
That I did it again.
I just don't get it.
How does that make you feel?
And how do they do this?
So what do I say?
No don't say it.
Now get up there.
Why what could he be doing there?
What did you say to her?
I say something you don't like.
What do I get?
Now - where were we?
That's no good.
That was for you again.
That was for you.
I don't want him.
Well - what is he now?
Give me that again!
I'll tell you what I'll do.
That's where you come in.
But why did I do it?
What was this all for?
Well these things take time.
I just don't know.
I mean I've always thought he was.
I shouldn't be.
Yes very well I think.
Did you see it?
I want him back!
And now I want him back.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
What did you do to him?
Well it's up to us then isn't it?
No we don't.
They don't want him.
No not that way.
Yes I think I can.
Tell me about it please!
You've never been?
I just work there.
I would never think it!
Want to come out?
It's all for you.
Oh no I couldn't.
Because I can take it back.
You did this for me?
Isn't there something you would like to have?
I thought as much.
Who are they of?
What did you think?
Oh no do not say that.
I want you to say them back to me.
I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me.
Thank you so much for coming.
I just take the money.
I know all about it.
Where did you take him?
He'll be there.
I'd like to see it.
It's all right!
She did I tell you!
There IS no one.
I know you're in there!
Why do you go on about that?
What was she like?
PLEASE make them put them down.
You don't know what you're doing!
How do we know this is the way?
You can all see me?
That I cannot tell you.
I shouldn't have come.
They didn't like it!
Oh no no no!
I didn't mean to!
You DON'T like it do you?
Don't you FEEL it?
You there and you there.
I've got you!
There is another way.
We'd be the first!
Well where is he then?
How did he do that?
What do we have to do?
No it is NOT.
Same thing isn't it?
I don't feel BAD about it.
What have you got there?
Oh I couldn't do that!
Yes it is good.
Tell him I'm coming!
He'll be right with you.
I think I know.
I think we can help.
And we'll take it from there.
Should I give it more time?
Well why don't you tell me what's going on?
I wouldn't have thought that.
I think I should go back.
I think we should go.
See what you think.
I know what you mean.
You know what I did.
If you want to be with me you're with me.
Is that what you want?
But you weren't.
What are we doing?
I don't know what to do now.
You know we're okay.
I'm right here.
I want to know you.
No it isn't that.
Look at it out here.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
How could she have done this to me?
Would you do that?
I would like that.
But right now I should go.
Like it just isn't right with him.
Who wouldn't like that?
But I'm through with that.
You're very nice.
Do you know what I mean?
But I get it.
You're really nice.
I think about that.
I go to work.
But I think I am.
I like to think I am.
Yeah I don't know.
No I'm okay for now.
I'd like to be from then.
I like it too.
That was very nice of you.
I didn't think you were.
I'm not really.
I don't need that.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
No that's okay.
I know it's here.
I don't need nice.
Now I'm nice?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
See I wouldn't think that about you.
Yeah I got it.
That's what I'll do.
Well I'm there.
It's okay really.
No I mean I don't know.
Look I have to go.
I have to think.
That's what you have to say?
You said I do.
I just got in.
I didn't want to go.
I really should go.
Your back to me.
I didn't want to do this.
Is that like us?
And what are you like?
I'm never going to see her again.
How could she do this to me?
That's your look for me.
She did it to me.
There are two of them.
Couldn't make them out.
We can help you through this.
You never should have.
I hope you get your work done.
They have a right to know.
I know what it is.
How did I look?
I just said that!
Well what should we do?
I don't know what to do!
It's a good one all right.
That's a good one.
I didn't make you.
I want to do the right thing here.
I shouldn't have said that.
How do you mean?
Okay we're back in.
I'll take it from here.
And only I know it.
You can if you want.
I know who you are.
I wouldn't say that.
Oh we didn't get it all the way on.
Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
That doesn't mean anything.
How does she feel about you?
Why do you have to go?
How much do you know about it?
Do not do that!
You weren't there.
No he didn't.
We'll make it.
We all know where we're going.
I have to go with them.
She's come back.
I'm going in.
How do you know all this?
This is not about me at all!
So where are they?
But now we have to go to work.
You're all coming with me.
Then what what are you?
And I think there is.
How much time do you need?
I can see that what're they for?
This is where I need you.
What does it say?
Get out of there now!
Something like that yeah.
That's not it.
And that's the only one I have.
We're all here.
Then what are you doing here?
There's no one here.
Here's another one.
Do you know what it was?
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything.
How'd you know it was me?
You wouldn't say that if you could see me.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't know what it's like out there.
It's not him.
Where do you think?
It's still me.
I'm good as is.
You should be the one up there.
I cannot do it.
You'd never know it.
I don't really know.
And where do we think we're going?
Here we go again.
Now what is up with that?
She's not here.
Yeah for the last time I hope.
What is that thing?
And that's a good thing?
Then what is it?
It's not just the money.
Why didn't you say something?
I'm not the only one in there.
No way to know.
Last time didn't work out so well.
And he's not the only one.
What is that you've got on?
I am so tired.
Give me my money back.
I want my money back right now.
You're not going to tell me are you?
There's only one thing we can do.
All right I take it back.
Didn't you feel it?
I know what I look like.
Are you going to get one?
You just don't know him.'
You want it back?
I think I've got it.
This is what I do.
Here's what you do.
I can see it all now.
Well what do you want me to do?
I don't go at all.
Nice to be here.
But what are you going to do?
He's not coming.
I didn't tell you that.
I'm not going to tell him.
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
I just don't feel right.
He'll be out here.
Well I never did it.
So what did you do?
What should I do?
You can take it.
Don't you like him?
How's it going.
You mean you couldn't?
Or you wouldn't?
I couldn't make it in time.
Is this your first time?
Where do you feel like going?
Do you really have to go?
I'll come in.
Do you know what you want?
I have to get going.
What did they do to her?
I didn't think so.
We should get some of that.
Where'd you get this?
What could they do?
She's got to go.
You'll like it.
You'd do that wouldn't you?
I need it again!
Did you put him on to her?
They didn't have any.
Can we make it?
I want it now.
Look what are we doing here?
Why do you think we're here?
Here's how it is.
Could I have that please?
You and a lot of other people.
I'd do just about anything for that!
I'll help you all you need!
They'll get in!
I don't know I just got here.
Where are you two going?
You know where it is?
Are you two all right?
Did you see that!?
We should go right now!
Come on come on.
I'm not going down there again!
What's it for?
They're right here.
Who's with me?
Yeah the lot's right there.
What's in the back?
We're going to get help.
How much I got what?
How much you got?
What's it for!
What do you mean what?
And what's that?
You all know where that is?
Get something on that.
Yeah I'll go.
She's not very nice is she?
If there is only one way out for us there is only one way in for them.
Okay well that's something.
Did we make it?
I'll do anything to help.
I need to get to her.
You know you don't have to do this.
What're you doing?
Come on it's just what you need!
Okay but come here first.
I tell you I want to give these things!
You didn't tell him did you?
You have no right!
You weren't going to tell me were you?
You know what she'll do.
What do you think I should do?
If I didn't I wouldn't put you through it.
You really want to go?
I didn't have much to do with it.
I can thank you for that.
Only if you were in it.
Just a little way.
That would be okay.
It was very good to see you again.
No we're not.
How nice to see you.
Been a lot of years you know.
You give up on her?
There's just one more thing.
I don't know how or why but I would.
Look out for me.
Well I would have you know?
You can do that you know?
But I don't want to be like that.
If you give them what they want you can get anything.
No they don't do they?
Is that why you did it?
Why'd they do it?
You can make good money at it.
How'd I look?
What'd you think?
But I'm not.
So who are you then?
You think I got it?
It's in you.
But I want to.
I'm going out!
You know what that's like?
They want you back!
I want you to.
Tell them who I am!
Don't I know you?
It was very good to see her.
What is that to you?
Why do you not go to them?
She's not for you.
You'll make her.
There is something I want.
Do I have one?
What did you want with me?
Then why am I here?
It's not like him.
What about your work?
I'm all right.
If only I could.
Why should it be so?
Oh do give him here!
We'd be out of work.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
And here's to Him.
Only you would think of that!
You know of it?
How is it you come to be here?
We should go now.
It will be all right.
What'd you see?
That's got her.
I'll go take a look.
Not if they're where I think they are.
You can only do what you can do.
Don't get up.
I'm like you.
I never said do what I do I said do what I say.
Didn't think so.
What's this about money?
We've all done it.
Why shouldn't I be?
Why just look at all this.
I never said help us!
I didn't do anything!
I did what you said.
Where are you right now?
You know what you look like?
That's what you look like.
That's what you think?
Yeah I think so.
This is not me!
Do you think this is what I am?
How's that feel?
How's it feel?
What did I tell you?
Okay I'll have one.
How come you're doing this?
Then that's all I have to say.
You know that don't you?
Think we're had.
Come work for me.
That's how it should've been.
Or thought you did.
You don't know that.
Would I be the only one?
Just do it okay?
I've had it.
So here we are again.
Really thank you so much.
Just like you would be.
Last time I didn't.
To get from here to there?
And how do you know that?
That's not right.
Right here right now.
I'll take this one.
Know what I mean?
Wouldn't be a first.
Oh yes he will.
He's not going to do it.
This isn't me.
I don't do things like this.
I know a way.
But I haven't.
I'll take them all.
I've got something on this.
Take me with you.
Is she always like this?
You will have to go and get help!
They didn't make it.
That is when we will go in.
Get your people out of there or I will.
They are with me!
What do we know?
What'd they say?
They should get you through.
How do I do that?
I thought there would be more.
So you're in?
Why do you need that?
Do I know you?
What are you doing in there?
There's no time!
You WILL go out there.
I'm doing it!
It just wasn't like him.
But you don't?
Okay that's where you want to be.
Make a right there.
Okay we got it.
We need another one.
What does that mean?!!!
We just don't KNOW it.
Do you know WHY?
Yeah what is it?
Oh I'm not?
Put me back on with him.
Where'd they go?
We shouldn't have to DO this!
Why is it HERE?
Yes I'm here!
I need time to think.
We have no right to do this.
Well you have to tell them.
I'm not going to tell them.
When are you going to tell them?
That's it It's go time.
Oh I don't think so.
Get us out of here!
Because they're coming right at us.
What does she see in them?
They always say that.
Then I need you.
It's what they want.
Well what have you thought?
Will you do it?
But it's more than just that am I right?
How can you say that?
No I did not.
So good to be back!
What can he do?
He's up there.
When we see them.
They're good people.
You never have been.
They really mean it.
And what is this then?
That's not what I said!
How do they get here?
You get the money?
You mean you don't know?
So where's the money?
Why isn't he here?
That's a lot.
Now why would you do that?
Well I don't know.
I have to go get it.
I need the money.
Get something going there.
I'm with you on that.
That's right me.
Yeah where've you been?
You say look at you?
So who are you?
Yeah I'm here.
That's who I am.
Why would I do that?
How'd you get in here?
Get him out've here.
That's what I'd do.
Something shouldn't be there.
What've you got?
I say what I mean.
I said I'd think about it.
They don't know who you are.
What do you get out of this?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
He's in it to make money.
Go on tell her.
That's what I'm doing.
Tell me what you been up to.
I think you got it down.
How do I know that?
If you'd like to tell me yeah.
So you want to know.
How'd you know I was here?
It's not one of these?
Are you going down?
Oh I like him.
That is if you can make it.
Don't go out of your way.
What're you doing here?
What if it was?
I still don't.
Because we can see them.
Yeah what'd he have to say?
And I would know.
Yeah that's what we need.
What other money is there?
I don't know who it was.
All this time and I don't know it.
You're up first.
I think you know.
Do what you need to do.
I didn't get a good look.
What'd he look like?
That's a good thing?
Then why didn't they take it.
What do we do with him?
It was more than that.
I don't know are we?
It wasn't you.
Did you see him?
Only way to be.
Could be a lot more.
I'll be right up.
You got that right.
Tell him I'm not here!
Do you want some?
How should I know?
But what do I know?
That's just the way I am!
He's back there.
Do you want anything?
No it doesn't.
Where did you get that?
How about this one?
Why are we going here?
What should we do?
What's he doing now?
What's going on now?
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Why do I always have to do it?
I want to do him!
So what should we do?
You can have that one.
Just look at them!
How much is this?
Do you have my money?
Didn't they tell you?
I will if you want to.
Don't you like me?
So where would we go?
You know what we should do?
I mean you like me don't you?
Where did you get this?
In what way do you mean?
Does that mean you don't like me?
And you like them?
Well when can we do something?
Aren't you going to get that?
Yeah well you're not the only one.
You want me to do it?
We have to go in here!
Okay what about this one?
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Would you go out with her?
No you're not!
You're right about that.
Do you want to see it?
Is this one any good?
Did she say that?
Did she say anything to you about me?
Why wouldn't she tell me?
What did she tell you?
Don't thank me.
You're doing all the work.
As are they all.
How; we don't know where they are?
How could it be?
Can you do that?
Then why do it?
You never had it.
I wouldn't be in the way?
Don't much like them.
You think they'll come then?
I'll have to.
They know it's there.
Have you got it?
I don't really.
What did I do?
Now I don't know why.
You like him don't you?
Oh yes I think so.
Because they are here.
They will want a lot of money.
Do you need anything?
You want me to come in?
You know you are really doing very good work here.
Didn't I do it?
I think I do too.
Why do you say things like that?
You really weren't very good for me you know.
So what do I do now?
I'll put him down for you.
I think I should put him down now.
Or we could do that.
Were you on your way out?
You're really good you know.
Please don't say that.
Oh you think so?
Look I've had it with you.
Do they know you're doing this?
What are you doing up here?
I didn't mean to do that.
We'll be back.
Then why have you come?
What was will be what is will be no more.
You've got to do something!
That's all you have to say?
You were the one who got me in.
Do this for me.
That's where we come in.
I've been there.
I've had it with you.
Come up with anything?
Oh good you're here.
He's a mean one.
Don't you see?
Well don't think!
You coming down with something?
Have I done the right thing?
Now where are you going?
They're just coming to me.
You're very good.
I'm really tired.
Okay I'll help you.
Then I'll go.
What's in there?
So what do you think it was?
We'll get back to you.
One thing at a time.
Thank you for coming.
I want you to have this.
What's he want?
I want to know more about what you do here.
Why do you want to see it?
You could say that.
What's this one?
I don't like this.
Now what do you want?
He's here with me now.
Does she want to be?
It will be bad.
Didn't see anything Didn't get anything.
Did you see anything?
I couldn't help it!
Do you know when that might be?
I know what to do.
What do I say?
I can feel it.
You okay in there?
Now tell me what you really do.
What have I got now?
But I get what I want always don't I?
I have to come back.
You're coming back?
And don't tell me you don't know!
But have never been?
But that was something.
Isn't that right?
That's what I'm going to do.
They'll have me.
You're not going!
I'll do it!
Tell them I'll do it.
Just think about it!
That's one way to look at it.
You're in it!
Where did he do it?
Well what did he say?
How did he do it?
Why do you have to see him?
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would work.
I have to go back now.
I don't see how we can.
What are you going to do now?
Don't you have it on?
I don't feel well.
You've got to tell me what she said.
I said I think it is.
I think it is.
Is it because I'm here?
I've never been to it.
Get out of here.
Would you like to come in?
No I couldn't.
I'm not like this.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I just want to tell you something.
Could you do it?
Do you know what you're going to do?
I want you out of here.
Because I don't like you.
But she's okay now.
What did you do to her?
But it's all right now.
What are you then?
If that's all right.
What have you done to her?
Well don't thank me because I want you to.
Well I wouldn't.
You don't have to say that.
But it's not.
Well I'm not.
That's it isn't it?
Because I think I know what they are.
But why shouldn't I?
Because I don't want you to.
I don't think we were the first.
How do you think.
Why did you do that?
Well how do you feel about him then?
What do you say to him?
There isn't any.
Do you really want me to?
Well what do you want to know about it.
Now we are going to do this thing.
Are you tired of it?
Who said it was my first time?
It is isn't it?
It is your first time.
Is that all right?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
But there's one thing.
Why don't I get it?
Why don't you get it.
Do you want to get it now?
I'll get it.
Do you want me to get it?
I mean I could.
Do you want to?
He didn't see me.
I want to say something first.
I really don't want to put this on again.
I don't see why.
What if he did?
I don't think I should be up here.
Would you like to see it?
Because I like you.
I don't think of you that way.
I hadn't thought of it.
What do you think of me?
When is he coming back?
Will you come in please?
I got it all right.
I say I've got it.
They don't know?
Don't go on like this.
But I want you to.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Not if you don't want to.
Well I don't.
Why did you say that?
Then what do you do?
I want to tell you.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
She doesn't know about it.
That's what I'd do if I could.
Can you see me now?
And what are you going to do?
I'll do anything for you.
I'll get the money.
I will go with you.
I couldn't go through with it.
I don't want them now.
Please look at me.
What can you see?
How tired you are!
Why do you look at me like that?
I am very tired.
What do you want here?
That was my last.
How do you feel now?
Then you know him?
Is that for me?
You'll have a good time with me.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Oh don't go.
Have you got it now?
And I said we didn't.
Yes yes they do.
cannot do that.
You haven't time.
Do you know the time?
But when did he go?
I know these people.
What do you want with her?
No one would have thought it of me.
Well you can tell them I said they're right.
You really think so?
Well that's nice.
Please come out of it.
Come take a look.
So here we are!
I don't see how you do it.
You know who I work for.
He's going to be all right!
I have only one thing now.
That's what we'll do then.
What do I have to do to get it?
) That's what it is isn't it?
Oh that's it!
I don't see why not.
But that's the way I am you know the way I've always been.
I know just how bad I was.
I didn't know anything was.
No you wouldn't.
You still got time.
What you do with it is up to you.
You do if you're where I am.
Where you want to be.
You don't put up with that!
I should have been on it.
And you have to be.
What am I doing in here?
What I say is no.
That's what I say.
Don't I get any say in this?
I don't think I need it.
It's there now.
This is time out.
And a good one I think.
I don't see why you're still here.
No more than this?
It this all we have?
That's that then.
Yes I know I know.
You up to it now?
Well I'm back now.
We never know when and we never know why.
We never know how.
Well when you put it that way.
Why am I here?
Doesn't look good.
Do you know who did this?
Don't think so.
What more do you want?
I'll come out.
Then you come out here.
Where'd you get it?
It could have been.
I know you think that.
And how were things?
Haven't got one.
I'm like this.
I don't know what I hope.
What'll I do?
You thank her for me.
No no no no no.
Oh no no no no no.
It isn't there any more.
What's good about that?
Because it always does.
You hope this too?
Tell him to come here.
That's really what you want.
I don't do them well.
And no one's there now?
You don't know you want.
You know what I want?
I was I was.
What's that all about?
I hope he can.
How do you do.
Not here not here.
Have it your way.
It's time it's time.
You'll like it there.
Don't you know how much I like you?
Is that the same thing?
We have have we?
Would you say that again?
You've got to get out right now!
Will you please go?
You'll have to go.
There was so much going on.
You don't know?
I don't really know him.
Do I have to?
Why didn't you say so?
What does he say to do?
You know who this is?
Where will you be?
A lot of people don't.
You're going out?
He said one other thing.
It wasn't very nice.
It's really that bad?
I think that's what he'd do.
They're in there!
Or when I'm in there there's me in there.
Why would you do that?
This is very good for us.
Don't you know who I am?
You help me I'll help you.
You're going to thank me for this.
doing your work for you?
Do you know her?
She's out back.
You have to tell me where he is.
Really I don't.
I mean about her coming back.
They are the same.
Then why be good?
No please go on.
Yeah yeah go on.
What does he do?
But it's all you do.
How did you get to be the way you are?
Is that the way it was with you?
Now does that make me as good as you?
It's not good for you.
You want to go out and get something?
When you get out we'll go.
How much do you make?
Do you know where she would be?
I don't really do this.
I wasn't in it.
Does she know anything about this?
Don't do anything more.
You've got to tell me.
Things you don't want to know about.
You like this don't you.
There's not much you can do here.
Look I do this a lot.
No I didn't think she was.
Well what do they know?
Tell them anything you want.
You don't want to know.
What is going on?
Just do what I say.
They don't know.
I'll do anything you want.
You can do anything you want to me.
Really thought she was good.
She's with you.
They're all about the same.
What we got is just these here.
That's what I did.
What does that do?
He didn't look good at all.
He wouldn't say what.
Well that's all right.
It's all about what's going on.
Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Oh I don't have one.
Tell me what do you see?
You're the first.
I think we can come up with something.
Well don't go.
Well why don't you?
This is really nice.
Yes so do I.
I think I see it.
Oh it's all right.
Yes you're right.
Because they are all the same.
You look as if you could.
I don't have the time.
Thank you but I really have to go.
Oh so do I.
What will people say?
What do you know about her?
Where does she come from?
I had to give it up.
What would you say?
How do you feel about that?
And a lot of time.
Something for them to look up to.
You'll need one of these.
I'll get him back.
And I'm not the only one.
How does he know so much about me?
Got tired of me?
We'll come back for you.
That's what you do.
That's why we need you.
That you feel that way about me.
It'll go in.
And you to us.
Do you know who did this to you?
Take it from me.
What CAN you do?
There's very little I can do about it.
I need more of the same.
What do you want me to do.
Just help will you?
It's really me.
Tell me who you are.
I said: don't look.
Don't look at me.
Well can I come in or not?
What was there to see?
Come with me then.
Can I get you anything?
How are you doing through there?
He's BEEN here.
It's ONE of these.
You know you are.
Why don't you do the same?
Yeah why don't I?
Well isn't it?
I have to get out.
I want to see.
You don't like her at all do you?
I'll be nice.
No it's good to see you.
What do we do if there isn't?
You're not going?
That's what we want.
You couldn't be.
What is she doing?
Yeah you would say that wouldn't you?
How do you know about that?
I never thought I would say this but can I go work now?
Can I have it then?
I'll do one.
Is now a good time?
You can say what you like.
Can I do anything?
Yeah but more than that.
Here she's here and now!
Well I'll just make it for you.
Didn't think about it really.
You had no right.
And I still do and you don't.
How were we the same people?
Look we're okay now.
We just had a nice time.
What it was like.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Look we can do other things.
I didn't mean that.
When are you going back?
I don't want to go back.
Look I don't want to take up any more of your time.
I can see why you say that.
I've got too much to do.
Look are you coming or not?
Do you want me to be there?
Well think about it.
I don't know these people.
Is that the last of it?
Don't need to.
Think about what I said.
I do not know.
I know what you're like.
I work too you know.
Only because it's never the time.
But is this really the time?
They don't know him.
And so it is.
Or would you like them on?
Don't you like that?
Where did she go?
But that's it.
You don't have to tell him what you got.
Don't know about any of that.
I'm the last.
Will I see you again?
It's all the same.
What is it like?
There is something more.
I don't know any of these.
But that's where you come in.
Not all of them.
What's all that?
What will you do now?
I think you do.
What's all of this got to do with me?
But there's more.
What are you going to tell them?
That's my right.
I think he's got something to do with it.
I'll be back when I can.
That is not me.
You do not know what time can do.
Some like you and he have more.
And you will be good I can feel that.
In this I can help.
Then they were right.
It is as you are.
You know this you can feel it.
You feel you know me.
You are the same?
How can you know this?
I did at that.
But not from you.
What would you like?
It's all we have.
We need more time.
Then it is time two of us did.
This isn't done.
I want you to come to me.
All I need is time.
You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
How would you like to work for me?
I should say not!
I got it back.
Did you give her the money?
Oh she was here.
How'd you get out?
Yes wasn't it?
That's right here.
I've done it.
Have you got that money?
But I like it that way.
Oh it isn't like that.
Take a look will you?
What does she look like?
I should thank you.
Well I got to get back.
That'll be nice.
Then who are you?
Get out of here you!
No you don't!
Well we'll see about that.
That's what I am.
I know what it's going to be like.
That's what he said the last time.
Then why are you doing it?
I'm not doing it for you!
Will you come here?
What are you doing there?
You know I would.
What'll I tell him?
What will be will be.
What did you do with her?
Is he coming back here?
How much do you want on it?
They'll see him.
That's all you are.
I'd like to think.
Where is he I said.
Well I'm coming to it.
You'll get it.
That's not my money!
You see what I had to put up with?
How do you like that?
Now you got me.
Then what does he want with you?
Is he as good as you say?
Wouldn't do any good.
He does does he?
Don't do it for me!
Might just as well be.
If you have to you have to.
And so will you.
Well go on and take it.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Just what I said.
Don't tell me what to do!
Now that's a nice thing to say.
Oh yes I would.
You know you did!
Who do you want?
You know what I mean?
A lot of money.
That might be all right.
No I tell you!
We know what you're up to.
Now where is he?
Is that any good?
I don't know anything I tell you.
Same way you did.
No I couldn't do that.
And so do I!
I was just going to!
Yes I'll be right out there.
Well I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now do as I tell you.
Now what do you say?
I'll take it.
Yes she's still here.
I thought so too.
You know it is!
Come on with that money!
You don't have to go with me at all!
What good'll it do?
You see that don't you?
No no you're right.
Are you all right now?
I'll be right here.
They'll get him!
We've got to do something!
You know where they are?
They wouldn't take it.
No I don't think so.
Who do you think!
Yes I did just now.
How do you like that.
We want to see you.
Want to go out on it?
I only know one.
Well go on then.
Yes she did didn't she?
No she didn't.
That's what they do when they know how.
He's never going to come back.
I don't think it's right.
It's not the same.
I did see them.
You do you do.
I don't know?
I will if you will!
There is all right.
We've been had.
You thought you did.
What did we know?
What are you going to be then?
We don't know anything about it
And it was the last.
We didn't know that.
He said I was right.
I want him so much.
And where do you think you're going?
And you never did.
I know you mean well.
Yeah I'll do something.
You shouldn't a done that.
Can I help you with something?
I'd like to see that.
But if you did.
Come on we need something like this.
What are you doing!
I'll just go.
What'd you see who was she with where were they going?
I'm not doing that.
I know but we can make it out of here.
We can do it.
We've got get out of here we got get out of here.
I don't want to see that.
Yeah well he's still here.
See if anything is out there.
She's up to something.
You said it not me.
Why are you doing this?
Well go get her.
Oh yeah you know about that?
And think about what you've done.
It's not so bad.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
You are all that too.
But you have something more.
We still have you and I.
You think too much.
I've got some things to tell you.
And I think I'm going to.
I don't get that.
But I'm not going to.
Look at you two.
So he's doing okay?
Should I come with?
Thank you very much for that.
And I want to help.
I could come work for you!
I'll make it.
You're what I want.
All I want is to be what you want.
It's really good.
I just have to know.
I really need this.
I have to think!
It's a lot of work.
Thank you so much.
I'll just go on my way.
You'll never see me again.
Yes that's something to think about.
That's very good.
All I want's the money.
That's the way it's done.
That's the way it's done isn't it?
I'll make it up to you.
You know what's good for him?
Yeah I think we do.
Bad for me bad for you.
But that wouldn't mean anything to you.
You want me to tell her for you?
I didn't think he did.
You know what you were doing?
Here I got it.
How good is he?
I don't know when it was.
Why back me then?
That's the only way.
It's good for you.
Only when I work.
Yeah that's right.
Don't take me with you.
That's what I want.
Yeah that's what I think.
Never been out of it.
I'll get you your money back.
It don't look good on you.
You're coming with me.
How much we got?
I don't want it.
No no more for me.
Just you and me.
Doesn't any of this mean anything to you?
I'm a little tired.
When you feel like coming back you'll come back.
I need it the money.
Yes I want to know what for.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Look I'll be back.
What do you want to tell me?
Yes I need them very much.
Why'd I do it?
You don't have to look.
Why did he tell you?
He said I was.
Will you say that to me too?
Give it back to me.
Where do you get the money?
No why should I?
Oh it's not bad.
How do you like them?
You want to go with me?
Did you go out?
Well what do you want to know?
People come people go.
I like it to be what it is.
What do you do now?
That wouldn't give us much time would it?
That's right too.
Where do you come from?
You know how it is.
You have to go.
Have you always had it?
You're not them.
Do you want to go on?
It could help all of you.
If we want it it is.
But you'll like it where we're going.
Do we have to?
Is that all he said?
We've got to get help.
Don't go in.
But we have to see.
No but it was here.
I don't see anything.
Can you tell me about that?
Do you like it here?
You always like that don't you.
Well come on you two.
I really don't know much about them.
I couldn't get a thing out of him.
We're going with you.
I mean we're going too.
It's really nice of you to help us.
Then get them out of there.
I don't know how you put up with him.
What'd I say?
This I can see.
Why wouldn't he?
You can do that?
They don't know this.
You think they don't know what you know?
How're we doing?
It's doing what?
Didn't want to say anything.
It's good money.
I didn't take it.
I don't need it.
What do you want us to do?
Where do your people come from?
Why did you people come here?
But where are we going?
I'll tell him we'll take two.
You've got it!
Look what you did!
But don't you see?
You could be more right than you know.
Where did this come from?
Is that what you think of me?
I think he's in here.
You like the way I do things.
Now who are all these people?
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm here now.
What did you get?
Oh yes she did.
But what are they?
Do what I do.
You didn't did you?
If only I could have been with you.
But I thought you were one of them.
We've got to get out of here.
But what are you doing here?
You don't like him do you?
To get you here?
We say we will not.
There's got to be another way out.
What're we going to do?
You're all right now.
I'm going down.
He'll be okay.
What'd he say now?
What're we going to do?!
You don't look very good.
I'll get us out of here.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I know it's no good.
How do we get out?
There's a lot you don't know.
It's just money.
She's going with us?
I know she's not with them.
That's what you're good at.
That's what I'll do!
What will you do.
What do you hope?
And you got no one to help you.
And you know what I'll do?
It's not your time.
And on my time.
Oh you were right.
What'd you get out of her?
They're all in it.
I don't know what's going on.
Other than her there's no one here I know.
I can see out!
But what's it look like?
Now where would I be?
Help me out will you?
I don't want to be you.
You'll be me.
Oh yeah to what?
They'll know who I am.
I don't have any.
Where did he get you?
To get out of here.
They don't really need us.
They know I'm in here.
What does it say.
We have to get out of here.
What do you mean we.
I'll tell you what to say.
Don't do it.
Then how'd I get here?
What'd I do?
I just got here.
It wasn't him.
I know you did!
You know what I hope?
It's all we've got.
You didn't say it right.
Aren't we all.
Then how did you know?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
He work for us?
I'll get him out of here.
What about these people?
What do we do with them?
What are you doing here where've you been?
It is to me too.
I don't know Who.
Don't you want to get out?
Couldn't help it.
Now you know what I know.
I didn't say anything.
You said something first.
But you did it.
I'm no good at this.
Who do you work for?
I'll come back for you.
Why not what are you going to do?
Why did you then?
You can say that again.
That I really don't know.
What did you tell them?
What did they do?
This going to work?
You've been there?
It's back the other way.
You think I'm like that?
What's he done?
No he didn't do that.
Did he put you up to it?
There's not much to tell.
I had to go with them.
And you what do you like?
No one at all.
And how'm I doing?
If I was with you I wouldn't
You mean from it.
I'll be right there.
What do you do about what?
Why are you on to him?
He didn't do anything.
Could I have it please.
What does he know?
I'll take a look at what you got.
What do you mean what's it do?
Not on any of it.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Then what are you going to do?
Well what do you think I'm going to do?
I'm not going to do that.
But oh no not you.
I can take her.
No you do not.
How do you want to do it?
Yes I'm right here.
I'm going to tell you why.
You want to know why?
Did I get you up?
Now you tell me.
You think about that.
You think about them.
Oh you know what we do or do not need to know?
To think about it.
I could be anything.
If you want to do it.
Where do you work?
I know what I have to know.
Are they doing it?
All of us did.
When should we do this?
What did you want to see me about?
But I don't know.
Got one right here.
Why do you think she did it?
So am I right?
You don't like me?
No we're not!
You're right about me.
No that's not all.
I know you do.
Why would you be here?
He was right wasn't he?
But you're going through with it?
So where are you now?
Well what does he want?
You thought she had money.
She's here now.
And it's good!
Is she going through with it?
Do I get it?
Yes I know but
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!
I'll be going.
Are you going to see him?
No I'll go through with it.
Well what are we going to do about it?
It'll do no good.
I don't know very much about him.
You know how I feel about him.
Just the way I like it.
I'll never thank you!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
You'll never do it!
That what You'll have.
You know I'm going to have my way.
Do anything you want!
And there's one more thing I don't want!
That's to see you.
If you really mean it I will.
Will you do that?
Well you can help now.
What would you like to have me do?
She's been too much for me.
You never can tell.
I don't like you!
What do they say?
She doesn't want it.
Why didn't I think of it?
The only one I've got.
It's okay with me.
What do you think you're doing!
I hope you got your money.
They don't come that way any more.
Haven't you thought about it at all?
Come on get in.
What're you going to do?
A lot of people do it
I only work when I have to.
I don't want it now.
I didn't give him anything .
Why haven't you ?
There you go again!
You don't know how to do it.
You're doing all right.
It's all right with me.
All right I'm here to help you.
How's your's?
What do you mean
I didn't do it for you.
I never thought of that.
Why no I Yes .
No I've got that all right.
What am I going to do now?
Don't know what they want.
No it isn't.
Want to see me?
Do you think they'd see me?
It's up to you now.
No time to think.
Why he'll be back.
Isn't he here?
Who do you think she was?
Might as well give up.
Come on come on!
Yeah where am I?
But that's the way things go.
I've got to get right back.
Well I'll be
It's all right here.
This is something you got to do for me.
Well I got one now.
When I get through with that
Well you got one now.
He couldn't take it.
How do I know?
You know too much.
I didn't know it was anything like this see and
Yeah wouldn't it?
Well you're two up on me now.
I don't know how they got to me.
I mean you really are.
That's what I'm here for.
Do you know what you've done to me?
You know what you've done to me?
You think we want that?
Yeah you got it.
Had it for years.
Oh you got that?
Oh yes well come to think of it they're right.
No it was not.
As you well know.
I am - I am.
I don't know what to tell them.
You were there why didn't you say something?
What are you doing in here?
We need him back.
I said all I'm going to say.
But he was there all right.
Here take a look at it.
He'll never make it.
I just don't want to do it.
And what would I have to do?
That's all you've had all this time?
Can you take me with you?
But the only way to help you was to do that so I did it.
I need help and you can help me.
You were there for me.
How'd you know where he was?
Why were you with him?
What time do you have to be there?
What's she want?
He wouldn't say.
Can you do it or not?
You don't want much do you?
Help us do what?
What's in it?
This is your money?
Where're you going?
I didn't say you did.
He'll like that.
Tell him you want to see him?
It'll be more than that.
And is that it?
No I mean you right now.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Does she know that?
What're you up to?
How'd you feel about it?
So I did something about it.
It's not really something I think about.
How do you get it out?
It's a lot of money.
No you didn't.
What did they want to know?
You're not tired of it?
Who do you think I am?
You want to think about it?
And we have you.
I didn't see him.
You didn't tell me how to do that did you?
She didn't give me one.
Because I didn't have it.
But you didn't do that.
If I did I'd have to give you one wouldn't I?
Or we could take what we want.
It doesn't look like that much.
You said that the last time.
Who's the other one?
How can you help us?
Oh so now you know him?
You know what we want.
Now tell me what can we do for you?
Do you got something for me?
Yeah do you like it?
He said he didn't know about it.
Only that it's money.
If I wasn't this wouldn't work.
How do you know she did that?
I can do that.
What did they say?
Okay you got it.
I should get out of here?
I never got to know him really.
So where did you go?
I didn't really think anything of it.
If she's got it why didn't she take it all?
How much it there?
Well if you had to do it you had to do it.
You know how she is.
When I see you.
Did you get it?
What did he do?
I know you don't know.
That's good money.
Now tell me where my money's at.
In a way yes.
Well give it to me then.
Is that what I think it is?
I just don't got it on me.
Why would I tell you anything?
What does she do for you?
I get my money back don't I?
You think you could do that?
Who's it for?
I'll go through you.
What do you need me for?
You have it with you?
You know it's for you.
Get me out of here.
Well how do I look?
Just to see you.
You want to see me?
Well here I am.
Do you want some help?
What is it about us?
They've done something to us.
How can you not want to know?
I don't know if I can.
Did he say anything?
Something's going on here.
You've got to do something.
What'd he say that for?
You can do it.
Well I'll see what I can do about it.
That'd be a first.
I had to get in there.
What did you do to me?
Only we didn't make it.
You should go back to her.
That's about all she said.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She's like you that way.
What did she have to say?
But I see them.
We don't need them.
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't want them.
I've been coming here for years.
I need to see him.
Look I need to see him.
He's been here for years.
It'll just take some time.
It's the only one I had.
You know who I am.
I haven't done a thing.
You can have anything you want.
What'd you do that for?
Who do you think you are?
Well I've had it.
It's going to be all right.
I've got you now.
What are you doing to me?
It's not right for you or me.
I'm not here.
It might be for me.
I can do anything I want.
It's just me.
That's all he said.
He said you didn't have one.
That's what I want to know.
That's what they say when they don't know what it is.
What's in here?
And look what I got.
Yeah but for what?
What could I say?
It's on me.
Well that's good to know.
You know it's okay.
You know that time.
What are they like?
I mean do what you think is right.
So what do you think we should do?
I don't really know anything about it.
Well there we have it.
You don't know anything about me!
I don't know I just did.
Come on I have something for you.
I want to have it.
You don't have to do that.
Why aren't you at work?
Then what's going on?
Look if I could give it to you now I would.
I didn't know he had it in him!
Well it's not.
He did it with you.
You don't make anything.
What do you make with that?
What's that thing?
Some of us are.
There's just things I still want to do.
What would be a good time for you?
Can you see it?
No it is not!
Thank you for what?
Yeah but what is it?
What'll we do out there?
Now why is that?
It didn't work.
Why what did he do?
Because I was there.
So how's it going?
How much do you want?
You give them money.
That's just it.
Why you give money.
Why I do what?
But that's the thing.
Can I do it?
The way I see it.
You were the one.
But I didn't really want her to.
That would be good.
But I mean more like.
It's like all I think about now.
Well how was it?
Don't look for him.
I like you so much.
I just like you.
It'll be nice.
What's all this?
Because you know why.
What do I want to do?
You know what I want to do?
I don't feel so well.
Now that's it.
Do you want to come make out with me?
We'll work it out.
And it's like.
I was like yes!
I'm going out with him!
You know what it's like.
You know if you look at it.
No it wasn't.
You think I'm right?
What do you mean no?
Oh we'll be back.
I don't like you.
You know give him something to do.
You want me to what?
wouldn't have it.
I don't know but I think you're right.
It isn't him.
He was with me?
Where did you go!
I know where you are.
I'll give you anything you want.
It is her I want.
It's me you want.
No you haven't.
Who would you tell?
I hadn't thought of that.
I couldn't tell you that.
I know what I said!
But you said you didn't know her.
You're not going to tell me that.
If you got something to say to me just come out and say it!
Did you know her?
I haven't got time for this.
I had to make it right.
Why did he what?
He wouldn't come here.
What could I do?
Did he say something?
That's only because you don't know where to go.
What do you like?
He should be right back.
Would you like come in?
What are you doing up?
Not that I can see.
Why don't you go out there.
You want to know what I think?
What time did he get there?
What do you think he did?
What'd he do?
Look I'll do anything you want!
Are we going to go through this again?
That's got to be it.
We'll take it from here.
You want me to go with you?
Did they get him?
What do you see here?
You have something you want to say?
What are they please?
Yes here it is.
Why they're all the same?
Could you look and tell me what they are?
It could be anything.
If I have to.
What do you want on it?
I know you didn't
I know it was bad.
Because I work with them.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
Oh but it is.
I don't think I could.
What if she isn't?
We need your help.
Is this your first time here?
No I want you to do good.
We are coming for you.
I don't know how.
I will be with you.
I couldn't help it.
You will do as I tell you.
You cannot know that!
I can feel it!
There is no other way.
You will know in good time.
They will help us.
There's no way down.
You have done it?
You will not then?
I don't think that.
Now what do you have to give us?
I only want one.
He will not come.
He will come for me.
It is the time.
It is the time then.
You will come with me.
It will not help.
Why do you want to know?
Come on tell me!
Good what are you going to do?
Do you come back?
And I didn't say anything I said I don't know you.
I don't know any.
I should do something.
Do you need money?
We'll go where you want!
I don't want to go!
I don't want!
We'll get out I tell you!
Don't you like it?
Come on get down!
How did you do it?
How can you say it?
What if you don't make it?
It's what I'm going to do.
What would you like us to do?
Were you there to help her?
I'll take that as a no.
To me it is.
Did she tell you that?
You're not going up there.
I feel so bad for her.
Is he the only one?
Okay how would it work?
Did she do that to you too?
Like all the time?
I don't know anything any more!
You know how you get.
You're here now.
You're not here to see me?
I feel that too.
I like well what I see.
What do you want with me?
Why should he do that?
There isn't much time!
I should hope not!
What did it say?
Want to see me do it?
And who might that be?
What does she want from me?
And if I cannot?
Didn't you now?
I don't want it on me.
Tell me one thing more.
What's this now?
Oh but I have.
You do know where it is?
He was there and then he wasn't!
There's not much to do there.
I mean it's all work.
Who are all these people?
I couldn't get it to go down.
I put him to work.
What did you think it would be?
Did you feel anything?
I don't like any of it.
I thought you said he was?
I mean I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
I don't want you to!
I'm coming in.
I'll get your back.
I didn't know you were there.
I did tell you didn't I?
What are you on?
She didn't really say.
I want you in me now!
He's going back in.
I never said anything.
I haven't done anything.
What would you be doing now?
So I didn't.
What do you know about me?
What are you now?
What I'm not.
What would you like to be?
Not here with me.
When are you going to be back?
You'll have money when you work for it.
I'm not doing it!
I want you here.
You'll have money when you work.
I need some money.
Can I take you out?
I'm not going!
Why would you be there?
What would you do?
Do you know what I'd give to have this!
You need to know what?
He's not there!
And when he is he isn't!
What is it with this?
Do you need help?
The first and the last.
I did say he could go.
I want him with me.
Where he always is.
You got the money?
I mean he really is.
I'd be you.
I'll make you something.
You don't look like you.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I just thought it would be nice.
Want me to come back some other time?
I'm in here.
You look just like she said.
I really shouldn't.
And what will we do when we get there?
That's the way it is.
Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
You got us out!
Does that mean I'm in?
I think we can make it.
What do I want?
No I don't like it here.
There is no we.
There is a me there is a you.
I think we can do this.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
I want to be one of them.
I want you to be one of them.
Why didn't you take it?
What do you think about that?
You need it more than I do.
Well this is all I can give you.
I'm going in for him.
He'd do the same for me.
You'll never make it!
Something like that yes.
I can get more.
What does that say about me?
It's so nice to see all of you here.
You shouldn't have come here.
That's what I thought!
Yeah get out of here!
It would be so okay.
But you have something he doesn't have.
She's so nice.
How did you see me?
He'll be here.
What can I do about it?
You got it in you.
This don't look good.
Get back up here.
That wasn't me.
I don't know why I just said that.
You know what's nice about you?
I don't know but I like it.
You didn't have to do that.
He's the one.
When do you go up?
We're going back.
What do you really want?
You're really one of us now aren't you?
It's the only way.
How do we know this is the right way?
Will you take me with you?
How will they know we're coming?
Now to the right.
There's no other way for me
He's good isn't he?
Take me to them.
Can you take me there?
I don't know that one.
You're not going are you?
If you did know you'd tell me.
Are you here to help me?
I don't have much time.
Then it's still no.
I thought I had to do something.
Isn't it right?
Isn't that what you do?
Can you make it back?
I don't think you can make it.
Is that really it?
I don't know who you are.
Can you do it?
Don't look for us.
We'll see you.
Too much you think?
I didn't know what.
What's he do?
So what do we do?
I don't know him.
what did they want?
You don't look so good.
I want to see him.
I wouldn't know how.
I don't feel so good.
I want to go in.
You want to come in?
You're where right now?
No no I don't.
Who is doing this?
oh yeah it is.
Who's it from?
You know who it is.
I've been here.
Where'd you come from?
Why don't you like me?
Might as well - all of it.
So that's where you are.
Why we don't know anything about these people.
And now look at me!
That's what they've done.
And who is he ?
How'd he get there?
Well what do you know about that!
You were going to
All right I will!
If you want me to!
You mean you don't want to go?
They're going to take us.
When was all this?
I think I'd like that.
You get out of here!
Then it's done.
- and a very good one.
Now what would you like to do?
If they take us.
If it weren't for me you'd never get out!
Do you think this will come in my time?
Come on say it!
She's going with me.
What's she got to do with it?
Well why don't you go?
I didn't want to come.
Well I - I really don't know what to say.
If you'll only tell me about it.
I don't see that there's anything to say.
That's what you said.
What do you mean if we should get out?
I think I'm going to like it here.
What's it mean?
What are these people?
No you wouldn't say that.
I give it up.
That's what we'll do.
I've thought about it for years.
I was just going to.
It's not so bad really.
Can you tell me why?
You do more things!
Do you want to go?
It's good too.
What do you want him to do?
And what they're going to do with us!
All right I'll be there.
Please say you will.
I'll make some for you!
And if I say yes?
Well this didn't.
I need you to look at it.
I said I need you to look right here.
How does that help me?
He's here to help!
Do they have anything?
Where's it coming?
You don't know me at all.
It's the way we do it.
The way we've always done it.
I think it'd be a good look for you too.
Oh yeah well you know.
I really like that.
And you know that.
How could it not?
How is this going to help?
How'd you know that?
Did he say where?
I know what this is.
What if I don't?
But never like this.
We'd like to take a look.
Don't tell me.
You in or out?
Look at them all.
Why do we have them?
I am going back.
I have to go back.
I have to know.
I need to know how to get it.
How did I not see this?
Then who was he?
How can I do what I do now?
And put them out.
That's not much.
You like this one?
We're years from that.
And that's not all.
What's the other thing?
I need you to do two things for me.
Go back to work.
You don't have any.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
I tell you what.
I need you to get it out.
I need help with her.
Nice of you to come down here.
I feel bad about that.
Who said I would?
He said you would.
But you have to.
They said you would.
Where've you got him?
It wasn't so bad really.
And how would I know that?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Tell you what I'll do.
I don't think you do.
How did you get this?
Tell him not now.
I don't know why?
Here's where we're at.
What was it then?
He's not here now is he?
But there's still the other two.
I don't know I don't want to know.
Just tell me where it is.
I can take you down there.
What is it this time.
You think he don't know?
What time is it there?
He's not doing it.
I want you to take her with you.
This is who I am.
I'll give her what you never had.
I work for her.
But what about them?
You know where that is?
I'll see you then.
When's it going down?
How bad is it?
Well you look it.
If you're in he's in.
So that's it.
You know what I like?
You know why I like it?
Don't know much.
You don't know where you're going?
You're out of money?
What are you doing.
No I'll tell him.
He's right there.
Yeah I know how you do.
I know how you do.
Just get out there.
I'll be right out.
You know how I do.
Look who's back?
Like I said I don't know.
How'd they know who you were?
How much was it?
Did she say something?
What do you got there?
I think we might.
What time you done?
That's not what you said.
Well come on then.
It's back here.
How is it you're good?
Yeah but we're good.
How much is what?
Why am I bad?
What I say bad?
Couldn't make it.
Here's the money.
You just got here.
Here they are then.
I thought you might.
So tell me how it is.
Why aren't you coming?
Didn't you say that?
And where might that be?
That's what it is.
I don't want your money.
You might just do Little.
Where I come from.
He had it coming.
Yeah got to do something about you.
It's the money right?
I will do it.
What do you do with your time?
Why don't you want to look like what you are?
What did you give it to me for then?
You got some more?
We need you too!
Is that what this is about?
Oh yes there is.
I know a lot about you.
If you want to tell me.
Well I have this to say.
You put it very well.
I say a lot of things.
I know where you're going.
Now you come back.
And don't come back.
But I couldn't do it.
How did it work?
And there you are.
That's all I know!
That's how much there was.
So tell me more.
Oh you know that?
I'm not good at that.
I'm going to need it.
What do you mean I'm here?
I could do it.
You think too much?
And why'd she have to go with him?
I know you're not.
Why didn't she just come with you?
It's not too bad.
How do you think he got out?
Do you think he'll come back?
I never thought about it.
If they like me.
Then don't come.
It didn't work out that way.
You have the money.
You just said it.
I'm here for him.
Now why did you do that?
All right I'll see you!
That little one there.
What do you feel like doing?
She wasn't so bad.
You know what they say.
Now I tell you what I think.
I'd like that very much.
I think anything you want to do you'll do well.
I hope I'll see you again.
What can she do?
Well I'll tell you.
Where you going now?
That's the one.
No I don't know.
What didn't you like about her?
You don't like her.
I don't like her.
How'd you make out?
How's that with you?
Going to be okay?
I'd have to look it up.
What are you going to do with him?
There's only one way.
Or why you should.
I mean what were you doing?
You know what these are?
What's there to do?
Be nice to see you some time.
I'm with you there.
Be right with you.
Yeah if I can.
What have you got?
I'll take that one.
We think the same way.
And there it is.
I don't feel anything.
Okay but I'll need you to help.
No no that one.
You can see them too if you want.
I didn't mean with me.
But it isn't.
Why would he do that?
He's coming to.
The one and only.
How much time do I have?
We don't want any more than that.
Yes that's what I mean.
Oh get out of here!
We don't have to see him.
We might as well see him.
Did you get it too?
Well yes I was.
Yeah that's the one.
No not that bad.
It was about you.
The one in there.
He wouldn't be.
With all of it?
Oh come on now.
Yeah I'm all right.
Well don't say anything at all.
I mean what do you want?
How much money do you get?
I want to get something out of it.
Now that's too much!
Well what about it?
So what does he do?
You know what I'd do?
And I'd like to have it!
Oh I can do that.
It isn't the money.
I'll do anything you say.
What do you do when you work?
Go on go on go on.
What do they want?
What do you know about that?
Who's got him?
I tell you it's no good.
What would you say about that?
Now that's all right isn't it?
Where do you come in?
Well I don't get it.
What are you doing up here then?
That's what I mean.
I know one way you can do it.
What do you mean too bad?
Do you know what?
Well what about me?
You want me to go up with you?
Don't give up on her.
We don't know how much time we have.
Not that we know of.
You know what he did to me?
I'm in here because of you.
Tell him what what do you want me to tell him?
I feel them all the time.
Who are you again?
I didn't think you could do it.
It's all there.
I'll give you something.
For now that's all.
I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Then we'll come out.
You don't have to come here.
How are we going to get me in there?
So what do you want to do?
That's the way you've got to look at it.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't know what to say.
But it is not.
I don't know but I've got to get on there.
Is it always like this?
Why did he do it?
Get good at it.
Tell me what you need.
Well if I have to I have to.
I know how it can be.
Like it had to be done.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Know what you are?!
It's very nice.
You think I didn't need you?
He's no good for you.
What do we got?
You're in there.
That's why you're here.
In here I am.
Then where is she?
What did he tell you?
But you were with me.
I wasn't with you.
No one can do that.
I've got to get back.
It was just there.
He's on us!
Any way at all?
So how can we get to it?
I've got it!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
And how do we do that?
Did I say anything?
He'd like you.
And a lot more.
It's the same.
If we have to.
Have you thought about this?
And you'll do what I say!
I know about you.
No one will know.
We will work it out.
That's why I'm here.
I had to come and see.
And what do you want out of this?
And I never said no.
I can do it.
It's got to be.
Just to see what'd come out.
How do you get from here - to there?
- So how'd it go?
I'm not going to tell you that.
He's got a little something I think you'll like.
Oh here's something.
But who'd would want to -
I want to give him more.
Oh no no no.
Why'd you do it?
HE'S GOT MY -
How do I get there?
You mean - you mean I'm -
We're all okay.
I just want to be us.
I have something I have to give you.
When'd you get in?
There's a thing here!
Where'd he go?
How'd you get in there?
Like you'd know.
We like to think so yeah.
I've never been.
You wouldn't be in the way.
Oh I don't want to be in the way.
You know you never tell me anything.
She's at work.
And where is she?
But it isn't ?
Been there some time now.
And now they're all down on him.
How do you like this!
It isn't anything you have to do.
They are all right.
You've got to come!
Thank you for your time.
Well why not do it?
Where do we go from here?
I don't think that's the thing to do!
You've never been out there you said.
I've got more.
I don't see where we are with it.
No they couldn't.
Where is it to be?
Yes I see that.
Where would you get?
Now what does he do?
I'll see that you get there.
That's more like it!
See there you are!
You don't say!
Then you did say it.
What did I have to do with it?
He's done for!
Well that's out.
I'll make it right with you!
I'm all through.
I thought I could too.
And what does that make me to him?
And I'll tell you what we'll do.
You're more than that.
I know what I'm doing!
I'll say what I want !
I think I can.
Will you get it out for me?
Some people like it.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He always does it.
You are aren't you?
It isn't all!
It's to you.
Yes here we are again.
Well here we are again.
It's about you.
Well that's very nice.
No - not at all.
What do you know about that!
Don't you like them?
Now what do you see?
It's so nice out.
That's what I like about you.
What are they going to do?
There's just one thing more.
Oh no really - I'll be all right.
I'd like to
Why there she is!
Do you know what that is?
Yeah I thought so too.
Why do we have to do it?
It's for you.
You're not going through with this thing are you?
I only hope he does.
When're you going to see him again?
Look I can do it!
Yes but you said
All right and I'll get it again!
What do you think they want?
What was that you said he was?
That is to say
If there's anything I can do to
How'd it get in there?
Oh I don't mean that.
Now where were we?
That's what I want!
Oh no I'm not.
Yeah what if I am?
No - I don't want it thank you.
What do you want!
What did he do with them?
Get up from there.
Get up from there!
What do you think you're doing?
What do they want from me?
Yeah I got that.
So you know all about it?
Could you come with me please?
You never got back to me.
It's nice to see you again.
I want to know what's in here.
But you did come to me.
It's a thought I had.
You are so mean.
I never said that.
Not me you're not.
You might as well not come.
Do you want to come in?
I didn't see you there.
You've done well.
I think you'll like this.
Well come on in.
I want to give you something.
No I didn't think so.
Oh so that's him?
You know who that is don't you?
You really don't?
Come out this way.
No you can not.
Just who is here can you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
No I really don't.
I think you know what I mean.
What'd you want?
Will you be here?
Yes and that is what I have got right now.
Can I tell you something?
That's one way to put it.
I thought I had something to tell you.
That's what I like.
And he's where?
That was really bad wasn't it?
They're about the same.
But you get more now?
What would it take?
She's like that all the time.
I'll come to you.
But I need to see you a lot.
You think that now!
I didn't really want to come.
What can you tell me about this?
What did he want you to do?
We're not done.
What do you want me to see?
I see where you're going here.
It's not me is it?
It's not going to be me.
But you're good at it!
Who'd you go with?
That's not good.
Didn't need one.
Oh it's okay.
How's it coming?
It's just a thought.
Don't you like this?
I have a lot of money.
Do you know how much money I've got?
Where'd that come from?
I don't have one really.
And how does one do that?
What is he doing here?
Why do I put up with you?
It will be done.
What did you do to him!
And what did he say?
That thing is here!
That's what I am to you?
No we are not.
And what is that?
It's all up here.
What do you think is out there?
Could you tell me how to get there?
Yeah I was there.
What's it look like!
What do I do!
Oh yes I do!
I have something right here!
That's two down and only two to go.
Yes I know I do that to people.
It doesn't mean a thing.
I thought you were done?
We didn't think this through very well.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
We know who we are.
What did he mean?
Or you'll what?
Then why are you here?
Get out of there!
We're all the same really.
Are you coming or not?
But I just don't feel it.
Because that's what it is.
But we know they're out there.
And it would be the right thing to do.
And if it did how would we know it?
So why don't you just tell her!
So what can I get you?
Where am I going?
But how do we get in?
Yeah but how do we get to them?
Did you see her?
I will do that.
This is your first time here isn't it?
I have very little money.
How should I know.
I know what you're doing in there.
I thought I was.
What was there to tell?
That's all I can say.
That's all you can say?
All right thank you.
Why did you give it to him?
You are so good to me.
She would do anything for me.
Okay I know what I want this time.
You think they're in there?
Thought he was with you.
No we didn't.
It's about to work just come on.
How did you do that?
Just take it all.
They're right there in the back.
Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I don't know and it could be anything.
But I just say we go take a look.
How can they do this?
You know what this is?
What you mean so?
I thought the same thing.
I know be still.
Oh yeah where you work at?
Yeah that's me.
I know we had a good time.
You did all this for me?
What you mean you don't know?
Well then it's all good.
I can take the little one.
Are they still out there?
How you get up here?
I thought that was it.
Why would he take it?
Now get out of here.
All right I'll do it.
Do you know where that is?
Only you can help me.
Where did you get these?
Say it with me.
I don't see how they could be in on it.
They're in on it.
He's doing it for you.
Will you do that for me?
What are you going to do!
It'll come to you.
You're going to go see her.
I didn't see it.
It's about time I did.
One of them is in on it.
Take you right out there.
I said I have to do something.
I have to do something.
Don't be like that.
Could I see it?
Do we know anything about it?
I've got something for you.
It's time now.
It doesn't look like it.
Just put her on.
Only you can help her.
He's in there.
Just look at you!
No that's just it.
It's all here.
I didn't tell no one!
Now can I tell?
You think you can make me tell!
No one never did.
Can I have this?
She'll not be back.
I didn't know!
Where's she at?
Now who was this?
How can you tell?
I know who he is.
You don't know he did it.
How you know that?
Had to've done it.
I do want to know.
I've got to know!
Where you think you're going?
Do you think I did it?
He doesn't know you.
Have you any money?
You can have it for good.
Not bad at all.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time.
Now I know why.
I hope you like it.
What did she say about me?
But how will she look?
What can she say?
No not a thing.
Would you like to go out?
You want me to go in there?
I think so too.
It couldn't be done.
But he got you here.
Did you get that?
Then how did you get here?
Do you know how?
Just what you see.
Don't do it please.
You don't have to do a thing.
I still don't know what to make of it.
You should not make him work.
Then why don't we go?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
And where are we?
Now isn't that too bad!
That wouldn't have done any good.
I know what I said.
We could get that.
How much do you need?
Because they don't like the way I look.
It could be more than that.
Two years he still doesn't come!
I don't know anything about that.
How do you see this?
That's what they're doing.
I have too much to do.
We'll work on it.
Don't tell him.
I'll never do it again.
Where are they now?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
They don't have to.
We'll see about that.
But they all got it back again didn't they?
He was he was.
It's a thing she does.
Can you back me up on this?
But it was all we had.
You all know me.
Oh yeah he's good.
Because it's not you.
No we don't!
There'll be time for that.
They were for me.
Why didn't you?
And what am I doing?
This is about me.
Do you want that?
Just the two of us.
Then I'll be there for you.
I need you out there.
They need you too.
You don't have to go.
Don't you see it?
We never see them.
Not the one thing.
I don't feel that way no more.
It is not the one thing.
What is it mean?
But I have to say I don't think it is.
Would you tell me if you had?
Don't know why I did.
So when was he here?
But then there's this other.
I'd say it is.
What do you think.
That's very nice.
Well I put it in.
Well I didn't see it.
I don't say anything.
Not like you say.
She'll be all right?
She'll be all right.
What did I know to tell him.
What did you tell him?
Well I got a good one.
I need to know that.
What'd you give for that thing?
And where is that.
I know where it's going to be.
I know where the money is.
We don't have to do this.
Well I'd say he's at work.
What's this about?
I think you do too.
The same as you.
But that's not where I'm going.
Do you know where I'm going?
I think that you do.
And now it's here.
You just didn't know it.
I couldn't say.
I don't have some way to put it.
I could come back then.
Now is not a time.
What way would that be?
You might just could.
When did you last see him.
I do like you.
Then you'll like me.
He's not like you.
No I don't have it.
You don't have it.
You need to give me the money.
So what does that make me?
I'M NOT COMING BACK!
WHERE'RE YOU AT?
I'm not going out there!
I don't think I am.
I don't feel that no.
I'm not really who you think I am.
Do you know why I'm here?
I know what you are.
You're doing this now?
Who put you up to this?
Why am I doing this to you?
So where are we going?
It's up to us.
I know how much you want this.
Do you always get what you want?
So where'd you go?
You never know who you'll see.
If you didn't want to do it you should have said so!
It's something I had to do.
More than you know.
Yes I am and we're not going.
This one's got to be her.
Why is she doing this to me?
You're like me.
I don't think so!
What time're they coming?
He doesn't know.
They get in they get out.
It's not here.
That one look you got!
That is so right.
What'd you get her?
I don't think she can do it.
I said I'll think about it.
Why you know him?
You'd like that wouldn't you?
I don't think she will.
Well that's right!
Yeah look at me.
Still don't really.
You didn't know that at the time!
Don't I know it.
That don't do me no good!
Didn't she come?
I never said any of that!
Well I'll see you.
I would've come.
You don't want me?
And so are you!
I don't know what it is.
What are you tired from?
I said come here!
Where would we go?
There's a lot more to it than that.
Or we could do that yeah.
You're just the same!
I never feel like that.
That's all I want to know!
Will you do that for me please.
I'd like to come with you.
I don't know where that is.
Why'd he do it?
I'll get it if you want.
I know who you are and what you want.
Just get out of here.
Where's that coming from?
I shouldn't have done that.
Why're you here?
That's how he put it.
You'd make it.
He said it's up to us and I got here first didn't I?
I really mean that.
I wasn't doing this for me.
I don't get it!
She said it was up to me.
You should've done what I did.
Is that still going on?
The other two when we come out.
You don't know one thing about me!
Make her come out.
She's never coming out.
She said she did.
That's all you said you need.
We're okay here.
We can do this right?
That's all you need to know.
We'd like to come in.
What if I do?
He'll do something.
What what what is it?
We're not coming out.
They're coming in here aren't they?
What if they get in here?
It doesn't work?
He's going down.
Well I know that now.
Got us in here didn't I?
What it be is You aren't coming with us.
WHAT DO WE WANT?
Could you come in here please?
How can I be of help?
You all with that?
We'll get them.
You got to do something for me.
What I don't know how you mean?
If you got something to say say it.
What you see is what you got.
And who is we?
That would be nice too.
That would be nice.
You don't know him very well do you?
I want them back.
I see do as I say not as I do.
And what do they know?
Don't go in there.
I didn't see any.
It didn't take.
I've been doing this for two years.
Some are just to you.
I am I think.
We have to go back!
Please come with us!
I'm not tired!
I think we go on.
Is he really all right?
That's what I think.
Can I have another one?
What we done was right.
Because it's right.
This time I mean it.
We're still not where we're going.
I know what you just said.
Where does it go?
How does he do that?
You'll get it back.
Are you up for it?
Why don't I want to do this?
No I really think I do.
No good can come of it.
Then I tell you who you need.
Who's got it?
Do you not know what this is then?
Would that I could.
And never come back.
He said you say that!
We've got to do something to help him!
And you've got that have you?
I know where it's going to be and I'm going to take it.
Make it last then.
You would do that?
It's the right way.
We need to go!
I can get you out of here.
Where did he come from?
What are you going to do to him?
Do you know what I see?
I'll give you anything you want!
I know what you're doing.
You're not like me.
You know how I feel about you.
You know how much I need you.
I would do anything for you.
You don't want this.
What I've always done.
What did he want?
You're just in time.
He's got it.
I could go with you.
It's got to mean something.
Just look at it!
Why do we need it?
They did it to me!
Yeah we'll see.
You know this and that.
Yeah and what might that be?
Oh yes you are!
And you have him?
Do you have him?
Yes he might be.
Yes - isn't it.
So that's that.
What does this mean?
Would you like that?
I'll tell you what.
I don't like them.
Tell them I'm not going.
Yes I said it.
Did you really say it?
Yes - isn't it?
They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Do you like them?
Oh no not me!
Wouldn't that be nice!

You're all right.
All right all right!

Oh that's all right with me.
Well I should say!
This is on the up and up.
Not bad - not good - but not bad.

Because it's in you.
I think I've got something to say.
Still doesn't make it right.

And where's that?
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
So what is it?
You want to like take a look?
You like all this don't you?
Well if I don't who will?
You have no right to do this.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
Just give it to me!

Why is it always about you?

You'd like her.

But I don't.
So you think you can?
You're going to work now?

Thank you for your help.
Do you know them.
Please don't do this to me.

I will not be the last.
Get on your back!
Yes; that's it!
What have they done to you now?

But tell him I would.

How was I to tell you?
Doesn't that please you?
Do as I say.
It's not so bad here.
Oh why is that?

So who is he?
We have to know him.
TELL YOU IT IS
It doesn't have to be
Don't do this
Please don't say this.
Not one of them.
I really think you're
You're with them aren't you?
What do we do about that?
I know I know!
I know where you're from.
No we're all right.
You'll do all right.
What is it with you?
Yeah they're good.
I'll take it the way it is.
It's not done.
Tell me was that it?
I don't mean now.
Why'd you say them?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Well that's what I mean.
We did what we had to do.
I'll do anything.
That's all there was to it.
He don't know.
I've done a lot of bad things.
You wasn't with her?
You wasn't with her were you?
Yeah she's nice.
What does that have to do with it?
You know her that good?
I didn't tell them to come.
Who's he think he is?
See that I don't feel it.
I can take it.
What was that for?
You want me to do what?
I tell you one thing.
I need to come in.
I'll say anything you want me to say.
Come out of there!
What was it about?
You don't do it!
Do what I say.
You said I couldn't.
Here I'll help you.
What would you tell me?
You shouldn't be here with him.
You've got to get me out of here!
Didn't I tell you!
I don't know what you mean.
Give me what you've got.
How much do you think you'll need?
What do you need money for?
You can tell that from here?
Well yes and no.
He'll see you!
They're up now.
How did you know!
She's all right.
Something's in there.
But you're not?
You could see all the things he did couldn't you?
Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
A lot of things.
I have one now.
I mean what I said.
Oh I do that all the time.
Make the one you want.
Going on right here.
We got to do something.
What are we doing this for?
I like you you know?
How'd he get in?
You don't want me to go.
I've never done anything right.
I was in it.
We'll make time.
We don't have time.
Would you do it?
No he's not here.
I still think you should go down.
Are you going down there?
They know I'm here.
I don't know where he is.
We were coming right back.
When I was here?
We'll take it!
They just tell them one thing and mean another.
I got to go in.
How'd you get here?
They're still there!
Why should you be the only one.
Look will you do something for me?
One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
I really mean it.
It is for me too.
Not for you and not for me.
You don't need to do that.
There's just one thing.
I'm never going back.
Where can we go?
I'm not so bad.
Don't give it a thought.
You have to get to know him.
What's he like?
I don't think.
I'd like to that's all.
Can you help me or not?
You shouldn't have.
I don't know where you're going.
We'll need one.
Don't say it.
Then they do need me don't they.
That's all they want!
And we'll get out of this!
You're in on this.
Because he's not me!
What's going ON!!
I'm not him.
I'll see what you can do.
That they know me.
Be like you want to be.
I can get another one going.
You are to me.
And I need you.
What'd you tell him!
Might as well be.
You know how to get in and out.
You know where the money is.
Where's she work?
Who are you now.
We're doing it right here.
Because down there this is money.
They don't do it.
How do we do that?
How do we take them out?
You want that for here or to go?
How'd you know I'd do it.
You're all right!
You just don't do it for her.
Now I just don't know.
Haven't thought about it.
I don't know anything!
You're coming back to work for us right?
I mean I like you a lot -
This isn't all that bad.
But what is this?
No they're not.
No she did it.
You don't have to take me in.
I didn't tell him where I was from.
Well that's that then.
No I don't have them on me.
Yes we can go right now.
That's the way I look at it.
You're right this is bad.
How did you get out?
You haven't thought about this?
Oh this is bad this is so bad.
Look of things she doesn't.
We're going to look for him.
Why didn't you say so.
Go right out and get her.
Tell them to come on in.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
I know now why you did it.
If you want to go on I can make it all right.
Go on take it.
No I'm not all right.
Say what you want to say.
You wouldn't do a thing like that would you?
I thought it had something to do with me.
Why do you think?
You're not going out to look for them?
Tell me more about her.
I hope so too.
And look at it this way.
They were in it.
What did you come back for?
There's only two of them now.
But you never can tell.
Only he didn't.
Good thing you didn't.
He doesn't like me.
How's she feel?
All right you didn't know.
I didn't know who she was.
That something I shouldn't see?
I don't like to see you go.
They shouldn't have done that.
Can I make it?
What do you know about that.
That's it then.
But not of you.
Only that isn't how it's going to be.
But that's where we're going.
We don't want to go there.
Why didn't she tell us?
Like we've always done.
Where would we be?
How do you know who we are?
Put on another one.
Take a look at him.
What do they look like?
You're so nice.
I was at first.
You think you can take him from me?
She was so nice.
Oh this is too much.
I hope she didn't see me.
I should go first.
What should we get?
Then what are we going to do?
Can you feel that?
Didn't I just say that?
I don't need your help.
Did you do that?
Yeah you feel that?
Yeah I can see that.
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll get them.
Oh I couldn't do that.
Is that all that you do?
I might need your help.
YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??
Just a little please.
Time to get up that's all.
It's her I tell you IT'S HER!
What did you just say?
I'll be back!
Always something isn't it?
You know how they are.
No he did not!
What's he know?
I'd like to get out of here.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
Can we go there now?
You want to now.
You should want to.
How much have you got?
How much does she want?
I want to know where she is.
I don't get this.
What did she want to know?
And that was all?
Don't go on.
She'll have to know some time.
We could tell him.
You'll be all right?
I was one of them.
I have to go -
I want you to see all of it.
I wouldn't want to take them out.
I just want to look at them.
It's here too.
I really shouldn't be doing this you know.
I'll do all I can to help.
I think it's time.
When I tell you.
What was she to you?
But why come to me?
If I didn't know where she was could I take you to her?
We haven't much time.
You know where she is?
I never thought you did.
But you would like to know where she is?
I know too much.
I haven't much to say.
But she was here?
I thought you might know her.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
You want to know?
You want to know how I feel?
Yeah you're right.
Are you going to tell her about them?
Did you come back here just to see her again?
Why wouldn't you I mean?
But if you were?
I just want out.
And now you can?
You could do that couldn't you?
Go down on me?
Is he going to see this?
Does he go down on you?
Don't you want to make one?
Anything I can think of.
Can we look at one?
Do you want me to?
Do you want them?
I feel like I can.
I feel like they do.
What's the first?
Didn't you know him well?
What about it do you like?
Oh I like it.
I like it very much.
Do you have other things?
I have thought about it yes.
Is that who it is?
If I'm right I want to know.
I thought that's what I did.
Did you do anything?
I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
I don't think they all did what I did.
That doesn't mean you do.
I feel like I do.
No but I did.
He wouldn't do that.
But why did you want to?
Did you tell him about me?
Do you have to say that?
So what's he look like?
I never do more than one.
Look I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here okay?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Do you like the way I look?
What do you get?
I think I get it.
Why did you want to come here?
I just want to know why you're here.
No he didn't put me up to this.
Did he put you up to this?
Well I'm here now.
Look are we going to do it or not?
What's she doing there?
Yeah I know what you mean.
I really think he's in a bad way.
It'll just be me.
Give them to me!
Yeah it's not bad.
Was he nice to you?
And that was her.
But where are you going?
It'll have to do for now.
What do I do then?
Can you make it?
He didn't make it.
Take all you want.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
I don't want to get up there.
Well I hadn't.
Could you tell us a little about it?
You shouldn't have said that.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I've got a lot going for me.
But what'll I do?
What'll I say?
Well there's still hope.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
What does he know about it?
We got to get going.
We did all we could.
Do you need some money?
She was good for you.
That's what people say.
Anything I'd know?
That's on us.
Why don't you come in?
That about does it.
So how was she?
We've got to go back.
What's it look like to you?
Just what you just said.
Don't give up.
You're going to make it.
I know what you need.
I'm so tired.
You didn't get any did you?
We're going to have some of it.
I know you are.
Is what the money thing?
Is it the money thing?
What do you think's going on?
You've been there.
You know how to to do it.
I mean come on!
I'm okay with it.
Well I'm tired.
Here's to us.
Then it's a good thing.
I mean look at me.
Come on do you think I'm doing the right thing?
You've been through it.
Doesn't have to be now.
Did you like that?
It's always like this.
I'm not anything really.
Well nice to see you now.
Didn't see you.
Hope you like it.
It's like a thing with you.
Yeah I'd say you're right on the money.
She got anything good?
I'm doing good good.
So how're you doing?
Yeah he's good that way.
She said she had a good time too.
Oh that's right.
Isn't that nice?
Tell him to see.
I don't feel much.
Are you going to do this or what?
You don't mean it.
But we couldn't see him.
I would say so.
What was the first thing?
I'd get down if I were you.
I wouldn't do that.
You've got to get these people out of here.
I didn't know you were out.
You're in it now.
You'll never make it.
This time you're really going?
You know where I'll be.
Just like you'd think.
And they were two of them.
You haven't got any money.
I've never been in there.
That don't mean much out here.
I never thought that.
Because they don't like what I want.
Could have been any one of us.
But go you will and I mean now.
What's all this then?
You need help don't you?
Why come to me?
He's good all right.
This is a lot of money.
I'm good for it.
Is that what he said?
What's he got?
It's not the money.
I'll take you to her.
You know what we have to do?
I don't know how you did it but thank you.
You don't know what I've been through.
Are you doing that again?
No there isn't.
They'll say anything.
Don't I always?
She'll never go to them.
There isn't one.
Why isn't she with you?
Yes yes again again.
But she's right there!
You have something I don't have.
You have to see her.
No that was me.
Thank her for me.
Why didn't she thank you?
Don't you like her?
You should get out more.
There was no other way.
Don't feel too bad.
I want to see her.
How are you doing it?
I know what you're up to.
You know you're really very good.
I take back what I said.
I mean you're really good.
Yes I'd like that.
What if they don't want help?
I think they all want that.
You're the only one who can help me.
What do you want more than anything?
I don't want her to know.
I don't tell her a thing.
If it's okay with you?
I'm going to see you again right?
Bad people for one.
They want me to do things for them.
You can see her?
I'd give anything to have been there.
There's only two of us.
And now you didn't take it again?
Anything bad about me?
You know what he did.
How'd he know I'd come?
I'm coming back up!!
What do you want to know.
You'll be back.
But I always said you'd come back.
Now: who are you?
Yeah that's right!
Well some of it.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!
How'd you get that?
Then why go back now?
It's coming right up.
I'll get it for you.
I'm going to get him to take me to him!
People didn't know.
What you up to?
What can I do you for?
I'll get if for you.
It's just a work thing.
Now he's here.
I thought he was it.
You might have said no.
I would've come back for you.
Who'd want to?
But you'll do it?
And I need it bad.
I'm coming through.
It shouldn't last.
No one's here.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Why are we doing this?
If I say go to two it's really one.
Do you know where is he now?
But there were more of you?
Yeah we've been through that.
Do you want me to say I did it?
Now do you know anything about that?
What did you say!
I don't see it like that at all.
You do the right thing.
And you're not?
Who am I then?
She'll come back.
Then I'll come out.
You do you don't.
Then what will you do?
But why is it doing what it's doing?
You'll need to do something.
What will you say?
Will she come back?
Where did she come from?
Why who did you see?
I'm too tired.
What does it want?
All I see is you.
Am I really her?
It put you here.
And there you were.
I think they help.
They do something to me.
Is that really what you want?
Who are you then?
I never said I didn't.
Don't do this.
If you're here.
Not any of it.
That's all I know right now.
You don't want me.
I don't think do.
Why did she do it?
I like that too.
Because I want you to know.
It can do this it can do that!
Please come with me.
I don't want to do this here.
You want it coming back with us?
You didn't like him?
You don't have to now.
It wouldn't work.
When can I see you?
Oh I do want to know.
Tell it like it is.
What's to like?
Yeah I like that!
Didn't do very well did you?
I don't have it with me.
Can we go then?
Not if you don't want me to.
Did you get him?
But you come back you come back for me.
He might get out.
So how'd it go?
But I got him!
No I need'm now!
He's good at this.
You in this with me?
She'll do what I say.
Why should she come in?
How do I know that's her?
I want to help you out of this.
You didn't do what I said.
Or didn't do.
I've got one too.
Well I like you too.
You'd feel what?
Need any more help?
He'll be back here.
I don't have to think.
Could be couldn't it?
We'll get some more.
Yeah what about it?
A little something what?
You would would you?
Then we're all in on it?
How much more do we have to take from him?
We're on to you.
I'm okay here.
All I know is he did it.
And I will go back!
Some are not bad at all.
You want to go?
Got a little something for you!
This is a good one!
What do they always say?
If she don't want you she don't get anything.
What if she don't want me?
I said say it again.
You can say that again!
You will not get them.
Because that's where he is.
I said we're all in on it.
What are we going to do with him?
How do they know?
I'll say it is.
You take it out.
Or don't you know?
Didn't you know?
So what good is it?
I never did and I never will.
I thought that's what you said.
I'll tell you how come.
That's how come.
Just one little thing.
Now you've done it.
I do not know anything!
The one you work with.
How do you look?
That's why I like you!
It is not me.
Tell you what to do.
What was I going to do with them?
That's where he's going.
I just got it.
What do you feel?
But we're going to get him back.
I'll need help.
Yes where would you go?
Did we do it?
You're going to be all right.
No no it's not.
Yes yes it is.
What do you mean you're not going?
No I didn't know that.
That will be all.
This is the only one.
I do not see how.
Not from here no.
There shouldn't be any.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Is there anything we can do?
That is all I know.
You would have done the same for me.
And I know you.
Tell him we're coming in.
Would you look at that?
That I have them is.
What I have done I had to do.
It is not here.
How can you tell that?
Where we going to be?
This is just to give us something to do isn't it?
Does that about do it?
Don't tell me you've got something.
Would you like it?
And who is this?
What's she doing here?
So you said at the time.
They just don't want us going in there.
I'd really like to know.
I did not think so.
I do this because I was there
Why don't I?
I feel the same thing.
How're you doing?
It'll come back to him.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
They like you very much.
You have no right to be here!
Now will you tell me something?
That one should do.
I thought you should know.
Don't know anything about it?
Oh here and there.
I'll be here.
Who wouldn't be?
Not just from you but from my people as well.
Because you're it.
I'm just tired.
Don't do this again.
You think they're still up there?
But I had a little help.
Do you have one?
How does it feel?
What's still there?
We've got to go now.
How did you know about that?
Did you need something?
Then make it so.
I think that's all.
Or not to be -
I'm going too.
And what did they tell you?
He's the one!
Where do we come in?
I know I was.
I SHOULD have been -
Why would they give them to us?
I do not think so.
And they'd be right.
Do you know where you are?
That was another time.
Is he very much like you were?
But so much is the same.
It'll only work for one of us.
You do not look like me.
But how can he?
The same way you want to know him.
You're not here.
I'll always be with you now.
This is so good.
We can only hope so.
Can anything be done for him?
Make the right one now!
But you want to.
Could you do that?
I see more than what you are.
I'm what you see now.
Oh but it does.
So what am I?
What's this all about?
I want to know where I come from.
Or just the one of us.
You know I do.
Do as I tell you!
I'm going to take a look.
I'll take that.
That's how I make money.
We'll do that.
We don't have to do it that way.
What's all this for?
I don't know if it's the only one.
They're coming out.
I'm never going to see you again am I?
What do I do now?
What will you say about us?
We don't have time for this.
If you want it.
We have to go another way.
I cannot go back.
You have to go back.
I'm just not tired.
You can have one.
Should I put one back?
I do not want to.
They didn't know you were up there.
Just to look from up there.
I'm going to go now.
Will you please do it my way?
When we get here.
You don't need me.
That's not much time.
I'm very tired.
When do you have to be here?
Why are you going here?
Are you from up there?
What is for things.
I'd like to help you.
I've got to get back there.
Tell him I'm not here.
Don't you see that?
It could have been anything.
I wouldn't think so.
See what I mean?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
You're going down.
How'd you get up here?
Because he put her there.
Come with me right now.
You have to get out of here.
You don't need him.
That's a good one coming from you.
I can get you what you want.
So what do you know about this?
Did you like it?
I'll have that.
I know he'll go for it.
But this is a bad one.
I'm on her.
Said I wouldn't want to see it.
Who was just here?
I mean she was just here.
It's what people want to see and you know it.
Yeah but how'd it get to you?
I do mean it.
You'll make out.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Take it to him.
We're going up.
You've got to see.
Think back about what she said.
Never really thought about it.
It's on your way.
I don't see a way out of it.
You still like me don't you?
Well I'm out.
That would be no.
It's still in the back.
How do you like it now?
Oh one other thing.
Want to take a look?
That's the thing.
Not as much as you'd think.
Oh yes I see.
What do you want from me!
Tell me if you see anything you want.
You do like to look don't you?
What did he look like?
We have another one.
They like the way I think.
What were you doing?
I'd like you to come and look at it.
You want to get him?
Get him to come to you.
There's been another one.
Not the way I can.
You need time to think.
He is very good.
Did he come on to you?
That's what I want to do.
And one other thing.
We want the same thing.
Did you know there was one?
Hope you never do.
This is a first.
What they got you doing?
I'll think about that.
It didn't feel that way.
I can do that?
That's two more than me.
He really said that?
I know but she did.
Can I have one of these?
It's not going to well?
I think about things.
You always know the right thing to say.
See it's all how you look at it.
How am I doing well?
How good am I doing?
What'd you get?
What do you have?
I didn't want to say anything.
I mean I need the money.
You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
What are they doing here?
You were so right.
You don't know how it is.
How's it going for you two?
Give me the money.
It's not you really.
There you two are.
Don't give me that!
She didn't see.
Now look at you.
She thought you were money.
What should I have done?
They know what you want.
You think they don't?
I'm too tired for this.
You think she's coming back?
Tell me that wasn't money.
I don't know what?
How can you say always?!
You should know that.
This is how you do it.
What'd you want me to do?
What do you want of me?
I'll come to you when I need you.
You're not going out.
How bad will it be?
Why do you come to me?
Can I do something for you still?
It's been two years.
I'll need him.
But I don't know when.
What was this for?
I know about what you mean!
So anything you have to say say it to me.
You look good too.
Will you give this to him.
We know he's all right but that's all.
And I'll tell you why.
How will they come at you?
Anything I can do for you.
When will I see you again?
All right if you think I shouldn't.
Can you say it?
You really want to know?
You wouldn't like him.
I look in on him.
Is it like they say?
Is he that good?
But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.
No I like him.
I'll come down.
I thought I might come back.
I don't think you were there were you?
I didn't did I?
I didn't help her.
You've been so good to me.
Okay you get in.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Can I get in?
How do I look.
You're doing really well.
I am never going back.
Don't say it again.
This is so good of you.
I'm never going back!
I feel like he's here.
How do you know him?
It's too much!
Something's going on.
Yes I'm good thank you.
Do you know it?
I'm well thank you.
I don't know I don't know I just know it.
I know it was you.
Didn't you see couldn't you see?
Look at me what?
I'll take you to him.
I said some things I shouldn't have.
Is he really not here?
Did he say why?
I never said that!
I'm going to go now I think.
How would you know that?
And now look at you.
I don't know her.
I've thought about you.
Just tell me some nice things.
That's the last thing you are.
What are you up to?
Tell me what's going on?
Or I could come back.
Because that's what I do.
That's good isn't it?
I think I just said.
Can we go up?
They'd never get me to go back.
No I don't feel so good.
Who was that again?
I didn't mean you.
It's not that bad.
That's really something.
Just people people you know.
Oh are you all right?
That's the last.
That what you want?
But it's a good thing to have.
Could you see anything?
I'll give you the money to go.
So I don't say a thing.
I can tell you that.
I'll see you here then.
Well you want to or not?
No I mean really.
Can I see you again?
Don't you want to go?
Don't you want to make it?
Why should I want to get out of here?
Don't you want to get out of here?
You want to make it like this?
I don't want to make it.
How do you want to make it?
There isn't time for that.
Do you know or don't you?
I got it all.
I don't know where they all are now.
You'll be all right.
What do you know?
Like do anything you know.
You know how I feel about what you do.
It's all I could think of.
You're going to help me?
Tell me what you really do.
You want to do the right thing?
I know who I am now and you don't.
I don't like me very much.
I'll be right down.
Not as bad as I thought it would.
And he got good.
That was nice of me.
They're not bad.
Do you feel it?
You have to help me down.
Well then as what did you go?
What do you know now?
Don't tell me I know about these things.
You've got to.
And you'll get one too.
Well yes that she was.
Didn't you have any help?
Well that's not what they think.
That's what I do.
They say you did.
Some of it might come back to you.
He's not coming back and I'm not him.
It's about me.
They'll come back you know.
I'll have to think about this.
But I'm not you know that.
And I know all them.
They all know you?
That's up to you.
Do you think I should go?
I'll be going too to help out.
I said I would.
And I'll give them what I have.
Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Then what was it?
And what had you done?
I think I'll have some of that too.
You can have it.
Don't you like us?
Just a little one.
Is she all right?
Why are they doing this?
How do I get down there?
What good'll that do?
We'd never make it.
But they'll be back.
I know you can.
But I'd like to.
You don't know you don't know!
When will you know?
Where will we go?
I don't know when.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know what good that'll do.
That's the last of it.
Would you like me to go for her?
Do you think she's all right?
And if you don't?
I'm not this way you know.
What good will they do?
We'll be all right.
Didn't know how he got in there.
But they didn't just get in.
Well where did he go?
I'm so very very tired.
Will you be all right here?
I think I should don't you?
What'll it say?
What do you do then?
What's in this?
I really shouldn't have any more.
But not for me.
It is for me.
I'd still like to see you.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
I'd like to see you.
I'll have to see.
Why would I want to see you of all people?
Oh no you don't!
Some of them are.
Would that be all right?
Oh well all right.
How is it there?
I didn't mean it that way.
If he were only that.
You've no thought of going there?
What's that you say?
I'll have no more to do with it.
I know it's all right.
Do you want it that much?
And you're going out now!
What are you going here?
Oh yes you will.
Why don't you do it then?
You will not have it?
We could do that.
But when he had them there then what?
But what did they do?
She would if she could.
But can anything be done for her?
You can get out.
How's that going?
Only what will I say?
What did they give you?
I'll always be with you.
But you wouldn't and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go.
I don't want to see!
Yes I do I really do.
But what you're doing now does.
You have one just like it.
You do know something.
But you you've had them.
It's not what you think.
You're in with them.
It's doesn't mean anything.
He was right here.
She'd want it.
I never would have thought of it.
I'll think of something.
You just thought you did.
I had to tell you!
I've got some money.
And he'll never get it that way.
It's for a lot of other things too.
He was very nice about it.
That no one can say.
Where are you going now?
Well he's not here.
And what do you want?
Well how do I know who you are?
Two down and two to go.
That's just the way we like it.
What's going' on?
I want to go.
How do you know they're not?
Don't go out there!
I said I'll take you there.
I'll take you there.
I was there too.
I'm tired now.
Does that mean we are or we aren't?
They know that we know about them.
He's just not like this.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do is it?
We've got it all.
Did you know that!
They'll be coming for all of us.
You've got to put this on.
I'm just like them!
Can I come up?
Is she one of them?
Don't tell her.
You've got to help me.
Do I have to do this?
I was here first.
What do you want from us?
Well where was he?
Just anything at all?
Don't think I don't.
You can tell them all that!
If it did get to him.
Where'd you go?
could be one of them.
Then we'll never make it.
Not the only one.
What we going to do?
I'd like to go up.
We going to make it?
Oh I got you.
What if it doesn't come?
So what do you make of it?
How we going to get back?
When do you think it got to him?
He's one of them.
Tell them who they are.
Who they could be.
But you need to go.
What's it all for?
This is the way in?
It's what they want you to see.
So do we go on?
You don't want him to see it.
To be with people.
Why should I help you?
You know of them?
Please we need your help.
You'll like it here.
Now will you go?
I could tell them.
Why would you come back to this?
Say I just come back again?
Tell you all about her.
How did you know to do that?
Can I tell you more?
I hope you're not coming down with something.
All right what is it now?
Get on one of them.
You know that's what it is.
There are some things I need to say to you.
Take him back to your time.
I thank you for that.
It's all the same here.
It's always been this way here.
I mean why do you do it?
You're still not well.
Can you go back?
We don't have anything like this.
That'll be all.
Now that's more like it.
Well just as I thought.
We are what we are.
But they don't come back.
Where do they take them?
There's no one here but us.
Will you take me?
What's it like where you come from?
I think I might be.
Should we be what?
Of people like you.
And what does that mean?
Don't give me that.
Oh yeah what'd he say?
Then where are you going?
Get me something to take to her.
That's all you got from him?
They're not here.
It's the only thing we can do.
But look at me.
And I want you out.
You had no right to go through anything.
Yeah but I don't know what.
How did he help?
You know how to get there?
I know it all.
Because I don't have time.
Why don't you help me?
Not for people like me.
Well what time is it?
Tell me what you do know.
Why would we do that?
How'd he get it?
I don't want it to.
Why what would you do?
And if I didn't want to come?
Well good for you.
Well how'd you get here?
Well where are you from?
Yeah I could too.
How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Do you know her too?
She's the one I hope did it.
Who do you think did it?
You want to come on in?
I need you to help me here.
Tell us about him.
I don't feel good.
Just take the money.
No I mean how would you do it?
I'll say anything you want.
I don't know what I thought.
Where do I go?
What is it for?
You didn't say what it was for did you?
I need that money.
I need you to help me.
All this for us?
I know it is.
See if that's him!
I know you know what I mean.
Do you feel like that?
I mean in a way you've got something to go back for.
I said all that?
What'd I say again?
Yeah you want it?
Well you got it now.
They don't know that!
It was just you and me there.
But it wasn't!
They think we like it.
Why do they have to do that?
I mean what did you say?
Well we need the money.
Now we have it.
I don't want to go that way.
Don't tell him anything.
Are you coming with me?
Are you up to this?
I mean I have to know.
No I didn't tell him.
How much money do you have with you?
We have to think this through.
We're still okay.
What do you think we should tell them?
So what if he was?
We'd have to.
Are you at work?
I did it and we all know it.
Now I want her back.
I'm going down there.
I'm out of here.
So that was it?
Well why don't you look her up?
Here just have one of these then.
Come on what were you going to say?
I thought I was the only one.
Well they go that way too.
I still feel something for her.
Well I think you're right I should look her up.
That I couldn't say.
And you were right she's really something.
I see where you're going.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there.
Okay I think I know what to do.
It's going to be okay.
And that's okay with me.
What what are you doing here?
Well yeah I didn't know much about him.
You know what I'd like to see?
No it was a good thing.
Are you going to be okay?
She'll know what to do.
Oh that's a good one.
Well there's only one thing to do.
So is that a yes or a no?
It shouldn't have.
But these people are right.
What's it about?
You need to do something about this.
We give them something.
They have to go in and they have to do it right.
No you weren't.
This could be more of the same.
Please get them out of here.
That's just the way it is.
It's not the first.
I know where I am.
He's out there.
When did we get that?
We're in there.
I'm going back in.
That's what we're doing here.
You have to come with me.
So did this one.
Why should I tell you.
He said he doesn't know.
Now I know he is.
What's going down here?
I'm on my way back in.
What do you people want?
What's with you people?
I didn't want to see you.
I wouldn't do that to you.
And that's one!
You didn't mean it.
You didn't think.
You'd do anything to take it back.
How does it go?
What do you do when you come here?
You look way out there.
You know where we are.
This is it then.
Where'd you get it.
What do you take me for?
You always get what you want?
And now I want you.
It's just as I thought.
I didn't see that.
You go up there there isn't time to think.
That's why you're up there.
It's him or me.
How about anything anything you want to do.
And I don't give up.
Well how about it?
What if he's not?
I'll give you that!
Then you've got something.
Where did you see that?
But I don't think you're right on that.
I could be too.
It is that too.
TELL HIM WILL YOU TELL HIM?
What is he doing?
But I have to!
Is there something I should know?
Now have you got it?
Have you still got it?
You've GOT it!!?
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Don't tell me okay.
What do you think it was?
What what are you doing?
He should've had me.
Well you'll just have to make do with him .
You were up there you know it too.
IT MIGHT GET YOU.
NO I GOT HIM.
I CAN TAKE HIM.
I'M ON MY WAY IN.
GET OUT OF THERE.
Tell me one thing.
You didn't help.
But it just doesn't work with you.
I'll have to think about it.
I don't know about them.
Would you take me back?
It's not one for one.
That's one good thing.
How can I go on?
That's all I want to do.
I just did it.
How could you do this?
You got what you want.
He wasn't in on it.
That's what you do!
Have you got that?
He's really been there.
I've got him.
Up to the right.
I want you to come back to me.
I just work here.
What did they do to you?
Just think about it.
Are you still you?
I thought you didn't like me.
I said get out!
How much you think?
We know what they are!
They're coming right now!
He'll never make it!
It's out last one.
They're up to something.
You got that right!
We just didn't tell you.
We're really in on something here!
Why would they do it?
And then what did they do?
She's got us.
That way we don't do anything right now.
I was in one.
I'd do the same.
Just tell us what you need.
It was right there.
Get us some help.
I think we do it.
What's it doing?
Don't tell me where to work.
You're doing good work.
Right out of here.
To all of us?
Then what did he say?
It was always like that.
What is she doing right now?
Tell me some other things about her.
We can do it right here.
WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Well where are you going?
No you couldn't.
Okay that's it.
He's with me.
No I do not.
There's something up there.
That was really something.
What did it mean?
All my things have me in them.
I don't want you to be like me.
WE got it back that's all.
I feel so bad.
And you're not coming.
Yes that's what I want.
You know I think you're right.
Don't tell me now.
He's the only one who could know where it was.
Who would do that?
It's just me now.
You know it and I know it.
I've got to see you.
When am I going to see you?
You'd think so.
Did you take it again?
You can tell me anything.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
I didn't see you?
How do you know what she doesn't like?
And look at this.
As if I didn't know.
Should I do it?
I want it to come from me.
So I could get your money.
If I take it.
You thought it was just.
We thought it was just.
You know what that would mean?
And why please tell us would you think that?
I thought I would need it.
I have it right here.
I wouldn't do it.
I know of him.
No I am not.
It's got to be that way.
Now isn't that right?
Isn't that what you did?
You know what you did?
Do you know what you did?
I didn't do too well for you.
Isn't that why you're doing it?
I know who they were.
You do what you want.
Well then what are you doing here?
I've got to work.
Is this a bad time.
And is that what you're going to do?
And are they going to get it?
I think I will.
And what are you?
Yes we know that you do.
We get it at work.
Why do you need me?
What we don't know is why.
That's what we'd like to know.
And you know what it was.
They'd take her in.
They'd take her.
But what can we do?
She didn't do anything.
What did she do?
We're going to need her.
Who have we got?
I know what I said but not now.
To help her to do what?
I'm going to help her.
I've got to get a look at them.
But you're not going to.
But you want to know something?
Didn't you have something to do with this?
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Did it do you any good?
Did you see it come down?
I'll get them!
I thought you had them.
It might give us something.
It didn't come down like one.
I've done about all I can do here.
You go back in.
We'll work something out.
You should be too.
He was just here!
I've got to go in!
When do you think it'll be done?
I don't know why you didn't tell me that's all.
We really got you didn't we?
No I don't think that at all.
Then what is he doing?
I am about this.
It's me don't you see.
There's still a way.
I'll tell you who you are.
That we're going back.
This is all you.
How'd you do.
I know you will.
You'll be out of it.
Where are you from any way?
But it's not is it?
You should tell him.
That's something he can take with him.
We'll have to take him with us.
As you can see there's a lot to do.
Look what do you want?
Look it's me okay?
Well what does it have to do with?
I didn't want to come but I did.
We'll think of something.
They tell you that?
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Come on he didn't mean anything.
I couldn't do it.
Do you have something to say?
Do it right now!
What's it going to be?
And you didn't do anything about it?
We was just there.
The same to you.
Yes that's so.
Who know's your here?
and I'll tell you then.
How'll he know what we look like?
You two go on.
So where'd you say you was?
Anything I can do for you?
I don't feel so good?
See if we can get some work?
Just don't tell her where we are.
That we're okay.
What you make of that?
Well I couldn't help it.
What was this one?
You get right on me.
Come look at this.
How about that one?
What'd she do?
What'd you say to her?
You up for that?
I just think about things as they come up.
Don't mean him.
I just want you to be all right.
Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you.
How could you do that?
I need you here.
Just tell me what you want.
How would I do that?
What do you want me to do about it?
But you want it.
I really need to know.
Oh well that's just it.
I like what you've done with it.
Only we might not make it in time.
You're good at that.
You'll be all right then.
Want some help with that?
I've got to.
That's why we're here.
What's to tell?
How bad is it for you?
Go out the other way.
Is he any good?
I mean what are we doing here?
I have to see her.
I'm not going with them.
So why did you take me up there?
And what's here?
This is so nice.
And he should know.
I know what the people are like.
Did I do anything?
What'd you tell him?
Want me to get that?
Some of the time he isn't.
Now what do we have here?
I think we should go now.
That's really it.
I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it.
So what are you doing out here?
It's not bad.
She's in it too.
He's going with me.
Did you just make that up?
It didn't come up.
And what did you say?
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might have.
What's he doing out there?
No I don't think you do.
Well no I don't see any way.
There's no way.
I mean don't you think there's no way?
I know what you're going to say.
You had another one didn't you?
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Are you going to tell him?
That's not right is it?
I want you to know that.
Why she do that?
You don't have to tell me this.
I thought you might like it.
It's really nice.
When can I see her?
I like that one.
It's why I like coming here.
You want to see?
You know anything about that?
Why don't you just tell me?
People have the right to know.
Would you like me to take you there?
Thank you all the same.
I shouldn't have been there.
And what are you doing?
Who do you see?
Please don't do it again.
Is this the first one?
You don't know!
You couldn't say.
We have a lot of work to do.
Why do you think you're here?
And why don't you like coming here?
But you don't like coming here.
You don't like coming here do you?
Then think about it.
That's right you did.
What's it look like?
Why not tell me now?
Why don't you just go now okay?
What did you do to them?
Look you can go now.
You're still here.
I'm okay now.
I don't know how!
You see where it's coming in?
Well that's that.
Not in this thing.
You did okay back there.
I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.
There's something down there.
No I think you were.
What would have you done?
Wasn't up to me.
You got all that?
No I mean it.
We're here now.
Okay here we go.
I just need to know that this thing is out of here!
We just got them.
He can still make it.
A little more so this time.
Then how come you're not with him?
When do you have to go back?
It's the same thing.
Don't you think so?
I didn't mean to put it that way.
And we really didn't do anything.
And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
And what are we going to do now?
I know we are.
Where is she going?
What have you got to say about that?
You need the money.
Now I can help you.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
No not like this one.
And what did they say about me?
And who is she?
But where did you come from?
Oh no not at all.
But we'll do something.
I'm always here.
Why do you think she does all this?
I mean look at these.
How did she know about him?
So I could go to him.
What did she mean?
What do you think it's there for?
Do you know who put it there?
Oh don't be I'm here.
Would you like to tell me?
Did you want it to come out?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Would you like to tell me why you're here?
And why am I here?
How does she know that?
You can tell me.
Did she make you do something you didn't want to?
What did she make you you do?
I'm always bad.
Is that what she said?
Because I don't want one.
No but I can never tell her that.
How did she know that?
Would you like some?
Would you like to be?
And what did you do?
And you like that?
Oh I know he does.
I'll have it.
Oh don't do this!
She didn't want any help.
Did you know about that?
That's how she got out.
Would you like one?
What did we do?
I know you don't.
Do you know what she did to her?
Take at look at it.
All right what do you need.
What good would it do.
I know what you are!
Why do you think that?
Isn't it always the way?
They'll be here.
Oh yes now I'm with you.
Are you going in?
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here!
Did you look in here?
Oh there you are!
I'll look in here again.
Should I say it?
And what do you do about it?
We do you know.
That's what they want you to think.
You're only right.
What's he on about?
I mean why do you do these things?
Oh well that's all right.
Oh no you're not.
That's all right then.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
I've only one thing to say to you.
We were going to do it.
Now get on with it.
Well you're not going.
That's what you tell me.
I would have said so.
Oh you do look.
Well you look like him.
I'm not no.
Oh you are I know you are.
It's always me isn't it?
What do you think are you're up to?
And they want me?
Yeah it's you all right.
Yeah I'm okay.
Are you okay in there?
No I want to go in.
Can we come up?
I'll go first.
Then take her down.
Where does that go?
Where's it coming from?
Yes I know what they make it out of so what?
And be right back.
I'll go get it.
Where did it come from?
Can you do anything for him?
Now we're in for it.
Should be coming through about there.
It wouldn't come.
I should hope so!
This should do it.
It's not going to work.
Is that what you mean?
They're coming this way!
Can you get them back?
Can you see anything?
No it's coming.
I've got it.
We do know that.
I'll get you out of there.
What did it do to you?
Can we get to him?
Now we go in.
We've got it up here!
All right so that's what we've got.
We're coming back!
Just the two of us?
I know I put it up.
Okay I'm out of here!
That's what we thought.
There's not much we can do out here.
Will you give it to her?
It's the same thing isn't it?
It's for this.
I don't think I'm going.
Couldn't go on?
And they would like to know how you are - and where.
What have you got to do with it?
Well say something - anything!
There never was there'll never be another like you.
She doesn't know.
But I do know you.
Where would you like to go?
There's so much I want to know.
It needn't be.
Because that is what they are.
But not this time.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did.
Come on get up.
No I'll tell it to you!
For the last time I'll tell it to you.
Well you needn't.
It'll say there.
It's a good thought.
When - when are you coming back?
I'm for it.
What have I got to do with it?
And what you want.
Is that what you want me to be?
If that's what you want to be.
I think we'd like very much.
You didn't have to tell me.
Is it the money?
Why you have to go out there.
She's on her way.
I'll tell you how.
How do you mean that?
He said he would.
He can help you.
Why shouldn't you?
I've got a lot to say.
Not just that way.
Why should you be?
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
I had to help out.
I wouldn't like.
If you'd like.
Not with you in them.
Isn't that what they always say?
Why should he - and why should you?
I want him to want me.
The way you do.
Do you want it on?
How much time have we?
What she is what she's done?
I didn't think you would!
I don't think I could be.
I never said it was!
But what could she do?
How about me what?
I think that's him.
I would have been.
What would you have done?
and who's going to be the nice one?
Did he just say what I think he said?
Anything you've got.
Why didn't we get that?
All right what do we know?
Think it might be anything?
I'll never get out of here in time.
I'm still here.
But you know who did.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Oh they're here.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
A lot of it was.
You've really got to go.
You come up with anything?
I really want to know.
Would I know him?
Please don't tell me never.
The what to what?
No it was good.
No that's not what I mean.
Well you're not.
Because I want to.
Well the same things you do.
I know what people think.
Well that's a no.
I think I've had one.
That's not why we're going out.
Well it's up to you.
Give it to me!
So you doing okay?
He's going in!
These are for you.
Don't you want me to?
And then this one time?
Okay I get it.
Well this one time?
I still think you're okay.
You've got something going?
Did you see this?
No no I'm not done!
Do you not want to be with me?
You want to do it?
You two really have something going don't you?
Don't back out on me now!
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
No it isn't!
I know where he'll go.
You did this to me.
But I still don't like it.
I have to work.
It's good to be back.
What good can you do?
I have work to do.
He's not like that.
There's something down there!
You shouldn't be down there!
Why isn't it doing anything!
I'm not the only one.
He didn't tell me anything.
We know you were with her.
Well this is it.
It's time to go.
You didn't know?
How do you know about it?
And what about you?
What a way to go.
And so am I.
Not that I know.
It's something more.
Still that's not -
I think he can help you -
There's two of them.
I know but I had to because .
Did I tell you that?
Well I don't have any money .
Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Just what do you think you're doing?
I don't know who I am!
I still don't know!
This is who you were.
This is who I am!
Is this what you want?
So where will you go?
I will not take the money!
You wouldn't know it.
We've been through this.
Do you feel all right?
Well you look nice.
It's my thing.
Yes I'll tell him.
No no no that's not it at all.
Oh don't go okay?
How can you do it?
And you know something?
Yeah yeah yeah you.
Oh come you don't need that.
Don't you think I do?
You know I like you I really mean it.
I really do like you.
I don't know what that is.
Oh I don't know I don't really.
Here you want some?
I don't know you really thought it was good?
Yeah you know something?
Really do you think so really?
No they didn't.
it's my first time.
No so help me.
this is my first time.
I'd like to come.
Oh no no no no no!
Oh I see I see.
Well I mean you don't have to you know.
No I got time.
Okay that's good.
Well where is it?
Where do you know her from?
Okay it's in.
Don't give it to me.
I don't know now.
What would they think?
There's people out there.
You know he really is.
No I cannot.
Oh yes that's right.
We really had a good time.
No no no not at all.
Oh yeah really oh!
It's the way they do things.
Like you didn't know.
You don't want that.
Why didn't you come in?
When did you get here?
She isn't there that's all.
I'm not that good.
Had a little help?
What what's about?
It's always not this time.
Oh there you are.
So they tell me.
Thank you thank you thank you.
It's not going to come up.
I'd say it was down.
Didn't I say?
It was good of you to be all this help.
Is he not going?
We should do it again.
He's going back to that.
I want it all.
I'll be with you.
I did want it for us.
I don't really think I can do it.
It isn't about you.
Don't do this!
Well there you go.
It's not like this all the time.
Don't get it.
I mean you're really back.
We're okay aren't we?
What did you get me?
Oh you know I am.
But I am right yes?
Anything I can do.
It's really not the same thing.
And you know he really does not.
I think you should then.
We're going to have to go back out there.
You don't need to thank me.
So tell me how's it going?
Like the last time.
No not like the last time.
I didn't know you had this.
We're always in here.
I thought it was okay where it was.
So where should I put it?
And here they are!
Out here I'm just what?
Come back here now!
What was that thing?
When can I see you again?
That's where I want to go!
You can make it!
What are you doing?!
No one should have to.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Will that be all?
What do you see out there?
You have to help me.
Think of all the things I've done for you!
I never thought he'd do it.
Might as well go all the way.
What are you doing with that?
I think you should.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
I'm not very good at it.
Yes I've got it.
And where are you now?
Just what are you going to tell her?
He and I are like this.
You're so right.
Would you like to?
So what's it going to be?
How's that again?
I know how it is.
Have a nice time.
Now will you get out?
I'll get back to you.
Well how about that?
You know where I am if you need me.
Yeah wasn't I?
Oh that's not me.
I don't know you at all.
Do you know who this is?
Yes I'm all right.
Well that's more like it.
It's on the way.
See if they'll what?
It's a thought.
I said I like all of them.
I know I know it's all right.
Come in this way.
What are we doing here?
It's what we do.
When'd you do it?
Well get in there.
What does that mean ?
You didn't like him.
How did they know?
How did we get here?
You know what you're doing?
And do you know why?
Yes you know why.
I want to think.
Do you know me?
You know you're right.
Am I right about these things?
You were not coming here to see me?
Did you know him very well?
Take us to him.
But it'll be back.
It'll be back.
Is that where he is?
They don't want him to go.
What if I say no.
That's what you want out of this isn't it?
I'll get you there all right.
You should know something.
Had some good years.
I have not but I very much want to.
Yes I think I do.
That I don't know.
What do you know about people?
You don't get it do you?
I got money there.
Does he have people?
I got it from here.
Here this is for you.
We'll go with you.
We know where they're going.
We do this my way.
But now no way.
I want us to go out.
What work do you do?
Tell me how bad it is.
Okay to say something now?
Just him and that's it.
Can I have that one?
I was going to do that for you.
Are you still coming?
Is there another way to see it?
Now I want you to do something for me.
So you'll be at work?
Will you please take it?
Don't want to.
We don't know if she's coming back.
If you want to see me you will not do this.
So I'm out.
Can you take him?
No it's all right.
See he's right.
You know who you want.
Did you like it that much?
I'm going back with you.
Not it at all really.
Well I work all the time.
I think you know that.
What's he look like?
Now I'll tell you something.
I'll tell you this.
Why don't you tell me.
Did you see how I did that?
How do I know this?
Just tell me that.
You don't have to tell me that.
I know just what you mean.
How did he know?
Was she the only one?
Because I'll take it.
It's always been that way.
But what are we?
Here I am again.
You didn't take it.
I don't like this at all.
What is going on here?
I mean you're not him.
You'll have the money.
If things go well I don't have to.
You'll be here.
Not that I would know but you look like you're really good at it.
What do you think he's doing?
Do you think he's here?
The things I need to get done.
What do you think about?
I need to think.
That's where he'll be.
Is it as nice as they say?
Just the first one.
Because I want to know.
Tell me about the first time.
They are very good at what they do.
Some people said that.
I never thought so.
It's not the same is it?
Because I'm done.
I know because I've done it.
You think you can do it again.
And that's going to take money a lot of money.
I don't need the money.
You're one of them aren't you?
You didn't know anything about me.
Is that all you want?
Can you tell me about it?
You're very good at this aren't you?
I know I don't.
This will take some time.
So how's your work?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
He got that one right.
What are you on about?
No We aren't going to do it.
So why didn't we?
We're going to need it all.
They'll never get us.
Yeah I'll take some.
Do you want to come and look?
Oh yeah what's that?
No you don't get it.
Yeah but it's not just that.
It's that one isn't it.
Do you know the way?
Will it help to get you out?
I want you so bad.
Come on I've got to go.
They'll do it.
It's not so much.
Yeah but it was okay.
Why are you doing all this what for?
We don't need you.
I thought I'd help out.
Would you like your things now?
Not all of them!
This is your doing?
Okay Okay but I want it right back.
You've got one haven't you?
Oh that's it?
People might think it's about us!
You're with who you should be.
I'll tell her you were here.
Now it's okay?
That'd be something.
And you don't.
What's she doing in there?
But if you could you would?
Will you do something for me?
I feel like I have no one.
That what you do?
So what do you want to see?
What would you do up here?
I know you want to.
Why are you doing all this?
When I have something to say.
I haven't been nice to you.
I know you don't want help.
I just don't know what for.
It's time to tell him.
It would be the right thing.
Tell me about him.
You've been well?
I need to be with her.
I'm not tired.
But I know what you're about.
When do I get time for me?
I want to come back.
Now I can do what I want.
So what did we just make?
Why would she do that?
Well it was there.
Don't tell me!
He said not to tell.
What you been doing?
What'd they look like?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
What do you say now?
Then why'd you do it?
Go on get out of here.
That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
What'd you come out here for?
I just don't want to go.
What'd you put him in there for?
Well I'm not going down there and look.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I don't think that'd work.
I can look and see.
Is that all there is to it?
They're so nice.
Yeah but I don't like it.
He'll say that?
When am I going to see you again?
How'd that be?
Then that's it!
So we'll help.
So I was right.
I think I'm on to something.
First thing I did.
Does he know we're coming?
So what's he up to?
How do we look?
Do we look okay?
We're going down!
What is this thing?
That's just what you would say.
I should go with you.
I should have know.
It's not here!
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
I want to know!
What are they about?
If you could I'd
Well that's what he said.
What DID you mean?
Well what do I tell him?
Where'd you get THAT from?
What do you think this is?
You mean you don't have ANYthing?
I just thought you should know that.
No what did it say?
You'll be back?
It's more than I've got.
This does not look good!
I didn't do this I did NOT do this
You'll see me again.
What is it they say?
Well it's your first time.
It's okay it's okay.
That's all right really
That's all right really thank you.
Something about all of US
Is that more than one thing?
THANK him for it!
She was there wasn't she?
That's how I'd do it.
Don't you know what she's doing?
It didn't have anything to do with her.
It was just that one time.
Something's on with you.
I don't need any help.
I didn't mean what I said.
I mean it thank you.
I did it for you.
You did it for me.
She said what you said she'd say.
You don't look so okay.
You know it is.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.
How's your back?
Why does he do it?
Aren't you going to thank me?
It's not the same thing is it?
Did you like it too much?
I was just going to have one.
You know all about me.
Yes it does doesn't it?
Can we get you anything?
Then I got to like what he did for me.
I'm just not.
I know what that's like.
Said she didn't know why she done it.
She doesn't know me.
Not now he don't.
You don't but it do you?
Do you want to know what it's about?
It's always how you would do it.
I'd take some of them out.
Oh I didn't know that.
You always think people don't like you.
I still think about her.
They work really well.
I don't need to.
You can do anything!
You didn't do very much to these.
How about right now?
Just look at him.
I didn't see you.
Well you said that.
You want me to put it here?
You can never tell.
You're doing something.
Just do what you do.
I thought I was one.
What's that about?
I hadn't thought about it.
How could you do that to me?
I just said that.
I don't go there.
I don't know why I just do!
I'll make you another one.
That one's for you.
You'll get there.
You don't have any!!
You get out too.
I mean just who do you think you are?
No that's be me and me.
Is that what I said?
Didn't I say that?
It does to me.
I'm the one you want!
And a very very good one.
I didn't need your help.
We've got work to do.
I can make it.
How about nice to see you?
And she did it all for me.
Oh but I am.
It just doesn't say how.
He'd never say Anything.
But I can tell.
What do we have here?
What do they mean?
There's one other thing.
Should you need me.
What's back there?
But it wasn't.
Why do you do that?
But what about all the good we can do?
Where will you go?
You can say it.
Why do we need you?
It's so you.
They don't come down here.
I'll take you with me.
Or all of me?
I don't know why I'm doing this.
It's like the last time.
You can do so much good for people.
I'd like to make it up to you.
As much as I do.
Do you want this money or don't you?
I don't like it up here.
You DID THAT to her!
And they know him.
Well you know me.
Oh it's too good.
He's not too bad.
Now what does that mean?
There's no one out here.
It's not just you.
It's the last thing we need.
Do we know anything about him?
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Yes isn't he.
Okay that'll do.
I've got a lot of time to make up.
Well where is she?
That's not that much.
You mean like this?
So like where is she?
Are we like doing it?
This is what it's all about.
No it wasn't!
Why it's you two.
Then I get tired.
We might need him.
We've got him.
Here have a look.
That's where we're from.
He said we could do you.
But he didn't.
We've got him where we want him.
Then it should be here.
Look she's right.
We need some help.
That's all we need.
She couldn't have.
Don't go out there.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Why don't they tell us something?
Why is it just you and me?
This is going to take some time.
We weren't there.
I don't get out much.
Do what you know.
Just do a little at a time.
I know these things.
Then I'll help them.
You've got to help them.
I can do it if I get out.
You've got to say it!
I want to get in.
All I want is to get out.
I've come for the last time.
I think she's in with them.
They're not here!
They do what they want.
I just want to see them.
Yeah yeah we'll think on it.
Oh they're still here.
You don't know these people.
They're just like you and me.
They're nice people!
They don't want to come down.
But it's not bad.
When I do it?
I like you to be here.
Yes so do we.
Oh I like that very much.
He's very nice.
Yes I do it's very good.
Yes very well thank you.
Can you see well?
Yes it is very good!
Do you think so?
I would like to do that.
I like that very much.
I feel very good in here.
Well if that's what you want then I want it too.
We can go this way.
Please it's time for us.
You can take me.
I would like to look.
Is that all you got to say?
The bad as well as the good?
You have me I am here.
I have always been here.
Other than that I'm doing very well.
How nice of you to come.
Is there something I've done?
I just want you to know that.
Now you see it again.
Do I know him?
For the first time.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it.
Tell her you need to see her.
How could they know?
And he was with her.
It's because they have so much of it.
Oh you know not a lot.
So how was it?
What was he doing?
If you're going to do something do it right.
I was wasn't I?
You weren't you.
We'll do it right now.
I can get us out of it if you want.
He said what I said!
I think that's what he said.
Lot's of it.
There's only one thing to do.
What's he been in?
I think you're on to something.
I'm the only one.
If not me who?
I don't know anything about her.
I'm done with her now.
I need to get in there!
It's been him!
I have to see you.
I like that about it.
I'll say you are.
How did you know it was me?
Then what do I do?
That what you're doing?
But you got to do it.
You have to be there.
They'll be all right.
Not for me you don't!
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
More than all right.
Well is it now?
Never be another like her.
Well what can you do?
I mean work work.
Or what she is.
You didn't tell me that.
And where is he?
I don't feel like it.
I don't know him that well.
What he do that for?
I know what I see.
What she look like?
Thought you might know who she is.
What you want there?
Oh I been out.
Tell me this one thing.
Where she come from?
You don't know what I think.
When she did it.
I said I had two things to say to you.
I have to tell you the other.
Oh but we got to.
But I got to do it.
Two things I got to say to you.
Make it the way I always do.
You don't know her?
Yeah yeah I know.
Where'd she been?
Come and get it.
I mean look at it.
What can they do?
Oh yeah how'd it go?
Well yes what did you think this was all about?
Why did he think you had it?
And then you know little of this little of that.
Not much to tell.
Yes I know about it.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
I did not know that.
Where do you want us to go?
All right get out.
Well she's back.
I'll say it again.
I'll say it again all right?
I'll tell you who I am!
You'll take him.
How does it look?
It doesn't have to be like that.
You don't want to go there.
He's right about one thing.
Then who does he work for?
What do you really think?
Did you think I wouldn't?
And so will we.
Too bad you're out of it.
So you're going to do this?
When did they get to you?
You're not coming?
Back then we did not.
You don't want me coming back.
You can help her.
You always have been.
How can you be out here?
I'm just tired that's all.
I have to work with you.
You shouldn't be here.
You don't have to be.
These are my people now.
I'm one of them.
You were never one of us.
There's no need for any of this.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
There is one other thing.
Who are you people?
That's why she had to go.
What're you doing there?
What's she look like?
Why are we here?
Who do you know who can?
Where do we go?
Oh who did then?
I don't think it was them.
Don't have one.
I think it's time to get out of here.
I'll get on it.
I'll have to go out.
He'll never know.
And then the other.
You don't look too good.
Isn't that what you want?
I said you're bad.
He's like you he doesn't say much.
So how do you know it was a he?
I don't know he didn't say anything.
Was it for you?
Where're you from?
Well now you do.
But I like you.
I want that money.
Then what'd you come here for?
Then you shouldn't have done it.
What did you take these for?
I'll get you.
if you need to.
Did I say that?.
GET OUT OF THERE!!
I know some things.
I don't think it's going to do much good.
I don't see how I can.
Well how did it go?.
You have your money.
One and I'm out.
This is what I want to do.
I don't have two years.
Oh they weren't that bad.
Yeah I don't feel so well.
We'll take it.
This is it for me.
For you and you and you.
Because if you are you have to tell me.
I know what you want.
What do I do with it?
What are you going to do with it?
Where do I put this!
Then where are we?
How does this work?
When do I see you?
Yeah I'm out.
We have the time.
How much can we get?
What's the other one?
How much time do you have?
Now you will tell me okay?
You will tell me why you are here?
Tell him I don't want to see him.
Yes I got it.
I am like you.
But we cannot.
You know why I'm here.
You know what I have to do.
I like to come up here.
As much as I can give you?
As much as you can give me.
You are like me.
I'll tell her.
This is it isn't it?
No it's good.
It's nice to have nice things.
What's good for us is good for him.
I've got something going.
You put me here.
I'll do something.
What are we going to do?!
And I'm never going back.
You've got to know that.
You want to come with me?
I'm going to make this right.
Time to go back.
I don't need a little.
I need a lot.
You take a little and then come back.
As much as you've got.
Yeah we're good.
Yeah but what are you doing out here?
Not you or any one of us.
Have you thought of this?
Then you can go.
What about the will?
But there's more?
I've got work to do.
Aren't they all?
Why would she want that?
I haven't done it in years.
And how are you now?
Don't you see what she's doing?
Why does she come to you?
Why'd you come here?
What do you think I've got?
How do you think it got there?
Why do you think he did that?
I really don't know her that well.
I do need you.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
What are you going you doing?
I've thought it all out.
You can see me now.
Can we get out of here?
I am who I am.
I'd like you to go with her.
I can back it up.
Why didn't you come to me?
You wouldn't like what you'd see.
You were with her weren't you?
What's she like?
If you want me to.
It didn't get there from me.
Well I can help.
We're not doing it!
It was so good to see them.
He is doing so well.
I didn't have to come!
Did we want to?
Then why do you?
Oh he did not.
That's why she couldn't tell us.
I don't have to know who she was.
How could she do that?
Don't say that!
First one then the other.
Oh that'll be nice.
We have some time.
But now that you have it -
How much we feel?
No they don't say much.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
I don't want you to say anything.
I don't need you to say anything.
Well why is that up to me?
Well what is this?
And if you think that's what this is -
Do you see some of them again?
You're right you know.
Yes that'd be nice.
Oh how is he?
I want you to come.
Would you like to come with me?
I know it's not the same.
But it's not the same.
What about other people?
I don't know what's coming.
I can look it up.
You've got it all right here you know.
You want to go back in?
You don't get out much do you?
I'd like to think so.
You haven't said anything you don't have a right to.
From what I can tell I got here just in time.
No more I don't think.
I'm not from here.
No that's not right.
Well what's nice about her?
You think that's really him?
I can see it now.
What it will be.
I've got what I want.
What will it take?
Time like this is that what you really want to know?
But no more than you do.
But how do you know?
But if it's him.
They're just that.
That's what you always said.
Don't tell me you didn't.
Just like I got.
She doesn't want me here.
But they will be.
As you can see now.
You could have had it done.
You didn't want us there.
What are we doing down here?
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
He's got something for us.
We're all tired.
How could that be?
You don't think I'll do it do you?
That's right I know.
Do you know who I am?!
No I know you don't.
You know he would have done you too.
What did she do to you?
You need the money just like we do.
Where is the money?
We're going to need some time.
What do you think we're going to do?
You don't need me!
He didn't see you did he?
He didn't have that much time.
All I got to do is get it back.
I know what I got to do!
I got to get the money.
That's what I think!
But you know he did it.
I should've done him!
It couldn't have been.
You mean they weren't up here?
There's no time.
I have to get out of here.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.
So you just got out?
I should be going.
Is that the money?
I've got the money.
I don't know where they are.
Because of what you are going to tell him.
There is no going back.
What time did you say they would be there?
And where is it now?
Do you think you know me like that?
That's why I need your help.
You said you were good.
They're all like that.
Not like I do.
That's how they are.
I know what I am.
You didn't want to see me did you?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
What I did time for?
Yeah come on in.
There's other work to do.
You just get out of here okay?
You shouldn't have to see this.
Why don't you get out of here?
Get out of my way.
How much more do you want me to tell you?
And what if I couldn't do that?
What am I going to do about that?
I thought you were never going to do that.
What do they want me to do?
We can do that.
That's all I get?
So now you know.
They're right about you aren't they?
You really don't know what's going on do you?
I mean I think so.
It's very bad this.
Just get out now.
That's who I want to be.
You could do that?
It's who you want to be.
We have this money.
We have what we have.
So what are we doing?
I don't know who he is!
And where is he now?
Look you could come up.
Look I don't know what's up there.
So this is it right?
I thought about it.
It's just not there.
No I mean I really don't know who I am.
That's all we're doing.
That's all I want.
It's always something right?
What if it doesn't come back?
How did I get here?
It's okay now.
What do I have to do.
But if you help us we'll help you.
We know that too.
Get me out of here!
Yes you've got to get me out of here.
That's for me to say.
How do you think I feel?
How could you do this to me?
Do you know what you're doing.
So what are you going to do about her?
What's she done?
You do know it all!
Come out I know you're in there
What have we done?
Look at that - right on time.
It does doesn't it?
I didn't like it.
Do as I say!
Don't look back!
They never tell you anything.
Well that's it!
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I don't want anything.
You'll like it when you get there.
But we can get one.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Now look what you've done to him.
I mean it's all right.
What do they want you or?
What you need is one of these.
What's it like?
But I think it might do you some good.
He's going to be all right right?
This is not a good time.
We can still go back.
That's how it's done.
But it's okay.
Think of it that way.
Don't give me that look.
That's a first.
I'm on my way out.
He one of them?
You did all you could.
I feel the need.
That's what we're here for.
You know it's that time.
That can only mean one thing.
I thought she'd be here.
What did they do with you?
I'll put her on.
That's not going to tell us anything.
Just tell me if you know.
What did I do to you?
I'm going to take it.
You didn't say anything to me?
Don't say anything about anything.
You know that I'm not.
Then what was good about it?
Do you feel good about it?
Did it really go well?
I didn't know you were going with him.
Not because you have to.
It's what he did.
Do one thing to me?
Just tell me what's really going on.
You didn't say anything to her?
He's right here.
I'll never tell.
You don't have time.
You didn't have to come here.
I really have to go.
How do I get out of here?
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Look what I got for you.
You want to come?
You mean something to me.
If you don't go?
How can you say that to me?
It wasn't as bad as he think was it?
I'd like to know.
So what did you think?
I'd like to go.
Were you going to you?
Does it have to be right now?
I'll get you through.
I didn't think you'd make it.
I wasn't bad.
Right back to you.
I don't think I like him.
Okay I'll go first.
Would you like to do me?
Don't you work here?
Would you really like to?
You really like it?
When do we get to see it?
Do you really like them?
Yeah and what would I say?
You didn't mean to what?
I didn't mean to.
What am I doing?
Well I don't know -
Yes they are aren't they?
I said I did didn't I!
What do you want for it?
You're coming with me!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!
I don't know about any -
Is that what that is?
Are you done with these?
I know that - I know that!
You don't have to do anything!
Oh no I couldn't do that.
If you see him.
Well there it is isn't it?
They're all the same!
You didn't like them.
Do you know what time it is?
You know what's going on.
Come on what was it?
Who's in it?
We've come all this way.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
I think it's him.
I think I could help.
Why'd you come back?
I'll back that up.
Oh I'm good.
Look a lot's been going on.
I need to tell you.
) What do you think?
And where are they now?
Oh I'll be there all right.
It's not right.
There isn't time.
But it's in the back.
I shouldn't go on like this.
It's so down.
The one and only?
I think I did.
You don't do anything.
It's not a look.
Where's the other one?
Tell you to do things?
Time to do what?
You are much more.
There is only one.
Now you are that one.
Well I'm done.
What should I do with it?
Well I hope so.
Well that's the thing.
You're so out of it.
I really was way way too too.
Well look who's here.
It's all the same thing.
I can do that too.
It doesn't work like that.
And he's right!
I want to be had.
I had to have you!
Aren't we all?
But you shouldn't think about it too much.
What's it say?
Will that work for me?
What do I got?
How come you don't like me?
And where can I go?
He can go all the way.
You can do anything you want.
Where does he go?
I would just get out.
Would that be so bad?
I mean what do you do about that?
We got other things to do too you know.
Because I don't - I -
I know she's there.
You did know that didn't you?
Oh no please please.
Who did this to you?
Yeah she's here.
She's there with you?
No I'm not okay.
And what'd she want?
Just give me the money.
I'm here to help you.
That's right yeah.
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
What good would that do?
Now what does she have to do with all this?
Will you tell me?
You should say so.
And what is it with you?
Well it's okay.
No no it's okay.
I know you like this.
If he does it again he's out for good.
So what do you think I do?
But you know what he did?
That's the way you do it.
You have got me there.
There's not much more I can do for him.
Well I don't know why.
I don't want you -
I'm - I'm -
You get down here!
I just hope it's not them.
You know why I want to do it.
Why do you want to do that?
She had the same.
What'd you have?
And where'd you go?
And I still get my money.
I'll go but I want my money right now!
I want you out of here!
Come with me now!
Come with me now.
I want you to come with me now.
Any more I couldn't.
Well that's why I'm here.
Where would you be then?
How could you say that?
Yes I - yes I do.
I don't know what to think -
Yeah how do I know?
He didn't say that to you did he?
Good so then you could tell me what the money is for.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
Why do want to make me feel so bad?
It's not the money it's just why do you want it?
Now I want you to tell me.
I mean I'm you know tell me what it's for.
That's a lot of money.
I just need it.
Why do you need that much?
There's a lot there.
Well I need a lot.
It's nice isn't it?
You're with me now.
I think I have a right to do that.
If it doesn't work out.
Yeah I know all that.
Don't you think it's time?
No no no no please please please please no please.
If you did know you were in on it.
I really think you're -
Don't thank me just do it.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
All right I will I will.
You know that's what you are?
So that's what I did.
Come on go back there?
I think I want my money back.
No I don't want one.
No you can you can.
You've been so nice to me.
Can I go in?
That way she'll get out of here.
I did - I didn't -
Is that what you did?
Do you see that?
Is that the last one?
He's not here?
If he's okay.
Do you know about that?
And how are things going down there?
Want me to take this for you?
I don't need you!
What about my money?
Tell me what you said to him.
It's what you want?
It's what you want isn't it?
I need some help.
You can take this.
No he wouldn't.
Well there's one thing you don't do.
See who I got in there.
There's a lot of money in there.
Oh you're right I know.
No I really do.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
That's what he's -
That's a - That's a good look.
No I know that look.
Don't make me come there.
I'm always here for you.
Are they out now?
Oh there aren't?
There's no more.
I know there's more.
I think that's it.
You know why right?
No no no no!
What could you do?
Get her out of here.
I want to think about it.
You know what I want you to do?
But they'd never okay anything you know?
Yeah what'd you tell him?
Get out of here?
I do all the work.
I'm the one who's here.
Come here come here.
Don't make me have to do this please.
You got that thing for me?
Then do it the way you want.
I know it I know it.
There's a lot of people here.
I'm not done.
No one can get out.
Oh I like her.
I like her a lot.
We have to do something.
I'm not through.
Again to one of you.
Do it some more.
How did you know to come here!
Oh I want this one.
Yeah she's okay.
It's just I like her a lot.
It's because I didn't come in.
You're the One.
This is one way.
I know he's there!
We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
And then I want out.
I got to get going.
That's how it's going to be.
I had it all.
Why don't you come and get it?
I have it now.
It's all there isn't it?
She'll never be the same.
She might not come to me.
It's one at a time.
And you have to be first.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.
He's in back.
I don't know what they did to her.
I don't want to think about it.
I got you back.
I might still get there first.
You're doing what you can.
What are they doing to her?
I do it all the time.
I'm not doing too well.
That's not her.
I wasn't always like that.
I don't think I was.
It's just the way I am.
I was just doing this.
It's just me and you again.
They don't know you.
She'll get right in.
What do they need her for?
She's back on.
Are you still with me?
Where'd they take you to?
I still don't see you.
You'll see her.
We don't see you.
We can be there.
Where are you coming from?
You could always make it up to her.
Then why doesn't she?
So who's he?
They don't mean much.
That's what he said.
Now that was a look.
It's him isn't it?
You're doing time for me.
Not if you go.
What would you do for me?
Don't go like that.
I had to go to work!
You'd do anything for me?
And you're not going to tell me more?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
It's her isn't it?
All right they do.
So they do know.
Know what I didn't know.
Make it up to me then.
What you doing here?
Did he come here too?
Didn't think I could.
What would he think?
Did you do that to him?
Shouldn't I go?
Give me that look again.
And what's it like?
And what if you don't?
And what if I say no?
No what is the thing?
That's the last thing I'll do.
Have a look at him.
Did you give him it?
See does he want some.
Who'd you think it was?
So it was you all the time.
Why do you want to do that for?
Are you all there?
Tell me something anything.
Don't have to tell her who you are.
See if she's all right.
Don't think that way.
Don't know her.
Will you think of her too?
We don't look on it like that.
I was right about you.
Now put it back in.
You could have said no.
You're going to have to do it aren't you?
Well I could say the same about you.
How did you know it was her?
So what do I look like?
What if I did?
You don't know me do you?
Here give it to me.
You mean he's here too?
Well you're right there.
If only we could see it.
You've got it.
When you come on you really come on.
How do you think I got here?
I want to know what it is.
Does he have the money?
Then who's this one?
Because they're still here.
Well there you are!
You're the only one who could have it.
But I don't have it.
Oh haven't I?
Have a good look.
So that was it.
The last one please.
They've got it I tell you!
But he'd have to.
He doesn't have the money.
I've got that right haven't I?
You don't know who did it.
Would you do anything like that?
This is good want some?
Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
There you said it.
Aren't you going to tell me?
Well you know now so please tell me who you are.
And the last one?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
And if it is?
Can I go now?
Is it all right?
It is all right.
He didn't have one.
It is up there!
I would put it up there!
What should we give him?
I'll get you some here okay?
How do you know what they're doing?
But he didn't!
You mean you and me?
What was all that?
I don't know where to go.
Why do you think we're going to?
I don't see him.
But what's all this?
What's he up to?
What is it about?
Who is it from?
is there anything you do?
No I wasn't.
It was a she.
We need you here.
I have something for you.
I'm not going to tell you not to go.
See where he is.
Then you should go.
You know about that too?
It doesn't have that much to do with me.
If you don't want to go with me just say so.
You know I want to go with you.
Please go with me.
He was one of them.
I got to go.
Did you want one?
And she didn't?
But you don't really mean it.
You did help a little.
What'd you come back for?
I'm a little
Yeah I know I know.
Well all the same.
That didn't work.
All right you got it you got it!
Go go go go go.
You think we can make what?!
All right you got it.
What did you do that for?
Look put this in the back.
All right then how about this?
I'll get more.
Do you know what I think?
No no no no no no.
I could always give you that.
But I can tell you this.
We're about done here.
Is that why you're here?
My people are out there!
Your people are out there!
What about these two?
Yeah I know him.
Here's what I want you to do.
And where are you going?
And what if it does?
And I'm good at this.
But you I don't know.
How do you do that?
I've got her.
I'd like to help her if I can.
I'll give you that.
You've got her?
Oh they don't?
When you're right you're right and you're right.
She's just no good.
Then what'll you do?
How do they do that?
And why's that?
I don't think about it one way or the other.
Do you know where she might be?
Aren't you coming back with me?
I will if you don't.
You didn't tell me.
Look there is something I should tell you.
And I want to know where.
Could you do anything about it?
What were you doing there?
It'll go here.
Well I mean yes.
No not for that one.
Now I think you know all you need to about me.
You mean you don't know where you were?
Well how much would you like?
Look at it this way.
Now if I see him I can help him.
Well you're going to get it.
I think I got something.
When did you come in?
I just want to know who put you up to it.
Well tell him I'll be back.
But I have to know.
Yeah I'll do that.
But how about here?
He did or he didn't?
You don't say?
Well you never know do you?
Now what can you see?
What is it what is it?
But how'd he do it?
But don't you like anything about what you do?
So I can have these?
You'll never know.
Don't look at me like that please.
So what'd they say?
I always thought that what you did was right and that was that.
You shouldn't tell me that now.
I put all your things in here.
If it hadn't been for you!
Then where's the money?
So what's that got to do with it?
Only - - Can I say something?
You don't really think so?
What does it say there?
Well well - isn't that nice?
You got that in?
He could tell you a lot.
I'm going back there.
They got work to do.
And if you think - if any of you think -
It's only money.
What you want me to want you mean.
You've got no right -
Oh I know I always say I mean it and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
I do it because I like it.
I said what time is it?
That's when you've got to make them.
They don't want you.
I mean I didn't.
Is that what you want to do?
I didn't think you did.
I didn't say.
But you like me don't you?
You really don't know who I am?
Why don't you go?
Why don't you -
You do anything you want to do.
And the first thing I'm going to do -
Where'm I going?
When they get back -
I've got to think of her.
They do it only because you do!
You see he just didn't have any to give.
If I wasn't he never had one.
I didn't want it.
I didn't get a thing.
Yeah but not in here.
Do you really want that?
Have a good one.
I didn't see you go back there.
So where is he?
Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
There's more isn't there?
Because I know you.
And you said yes?
I was going to tell you.
When did you get back?
She thought it was me.
What time was this?
He didn't mean it!
What don't you do?
Why do I say that?
Am I right or what?
She said she did all the work.
She said she didn't need any.
I don't want to think about that now.
Because I'm here.
I don't; you did.
So they'll put her back in!
Like you said you know.
If you go I go.
I have to go to this.
You always back down.
I don't back down.
Why do you do things like that?
She's in here?
I work just like you.
You had to tell him.
That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
What about what we do for you?
I didn't do that!
What is this about?
I like the way you think.
I'll see you there?
You work here now?
So what do you see?
Give him the money.
If you want do it.
We'll never know will we?
I did what I thought was right.
You don't know anything.
I'm coming out!
I think it's out.
Now go back and get help!
We're going to need it.
What do you think they're doing now?
Do you know what people would do for that?
Why'd you have to come up here?
You got to go back now!
What are you doing here!
Don't you feel anything?
He doesn't want my help.
Have her come up.
Who's going with you?
Don't you see what he's doing!
You got what we need?
Don't give him anything.
I just don't get this all.
He said it was a very good way.
I just don't get this at all.
I don't like you should do what you done.
This will be these people now.
They want to help.
I know who you are!
We want to help you.
No time no time yes.
Do you feel that way now?
He doesn't mean it.
Well - I'm back.
Well how are you then?
And when do I get out of here then?
Well that's all there is to it.
I want my money back.
I want to get up.
Give it to him.
I only know I want to be good.
I just want to be good.
He doesn't know you're up there!
I think you need it more than I do.
Like you I'm good at it.
You like what you do?
There were two of us.
That's how he was you see.
Tell me what you think.
What do you mean you don't have that there?
I know you're out there!
I should have done that.
Then what are you?
What'd they do?
You're too good.
No not just that.
Why'd you have to do that?
Don't make me do this.
Why don't you do it?
I've always been good.
I don't think I can do this.
Help me out here.
You like it here?
I was only going one way.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.
You got to get out of here.
I didn't know that at the time.
Didn't know who he was.
I don't know what it was.
I couldn't go back.
I know what it's like.
It's all I think about.
Just because they say so?
But first things first.
I know you wouldn't.
And I know how I feel.
If that's what you want.
What was he doing down here?
I mean come on.
They want one thing.
Please put it down.
I didn't mean for you to see it.
Was that who I thought it was?
This would be it?
If that's okay?
You can see her.
Yes that's right.
And what did I say?
But much more of it isn't.
And you feel bad for it?
What do I look like to you?
That you come with me.
And don't go to work.
We'll be right down.
Didn't see him.
Get her out of there.
But that's not who I am.
So are they coming or are we going?
Can you help us?
But what do I say?
Why don't you come back with me?
I hope it's not.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Like it or not.
It's what I want.
That's what they all say.
We should go back.
I got two years.
Don't feel you got to say anything.
Tell us about it.
I got it right.
She's got him!
She's on to him.
We got one who's got all of it.
It's all up to you.
Like I always do?
I only had two more years to go.
Look at Him go.
Where do you get that?
That's all there was.
Now get out of the way.
He doesn't know when to give in.
Now look what you did.
Look out for her.
Will you be okay?
He'll be back.
If you want him.
Just take a look.
I know it was him!
It's always on.
Tell her about what?
Do you have to tell her about it now?
If you really want her help.
I know about this.
We don't know about them here do we?
Tell me what you want me to say.
Doesn't work that way.
You get me out first.
She don't want it.
I'd like to know where he is.
Do anything you want to me.
You don't want her you want me.
Oh I think you will.
You have to come to me.
How do you know it was him.
And it's because of me.
Because I'm all you've got.
And if you do there'll be another one.
Then what do you need me for?
We've got another one.
I think you are.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
If he's not out why are they here?
I was very good at it.
Tell me what to do!
And you never know.
I don't want this.
What are you going to say?
Yeah you did that too.
There's something I want you to think about.
So what have we got?
Does this give us anything to go on?
You'll work what and who I tell you to work.
Don't do that to her.
That's what I don't know.
I'd like to go back.
I thought that was you up there.
Tell me what you would do.
Are you going to be all right?
That's going well then.
I don't know what he is now.
I don't think we should have come here.
They said it was here.
What does he want from you?
Really think about it.
I really thought it would work.
Do you want to go see him?
I'll take you if you want to go.
But what am I going to do?
How can I help?
Do you think I should?
I want to see it on you.
What about this one?
I'd have to see it on.
What do you think of this one?
What does that mean for you?
I think that's right.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
But that wasn't me.
Why'd you tell?
It'll work out.
That's where I always go when I get out.
Where would you go?
How's work going?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
You know what I think we need?
It'll get done.
No it's not like that.
It's not another one.
How's it look?
So tell me where did they go?
Where did they go?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
You're there now?
I'm doing good.
What did they take?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
But you were there?
You have something for me?
And for my help I would get what?
Get that will you?
It doesn't work.
We still have to get out of here.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
I'll tell you when it's time.
There's one more thing I need you to do.
You got money right?
I've got a way with people.
Can you get them?
What do you want now?
You think you can do that?
You're not good at it.
I said don't do it.
Did I not say that?
What'd I say to him?
I didn't look.
Yeah but you did do it.
You know a little of this a little of that.
You're going with them.
How are we going to do that?
The money isn't here.
They're not nice people.
When do we go?
I do as I please.
Where would I go?
Why are you still here?
So what if I don't?
It will be just the same.
She'll help you.
Come and get it if you can.
Go back to them first.
I'll give them to you.
I thought where did they all go?
Come back with me.
You shouldn't have come.
You're right but I don't know what to do.
Don't you want to see her again.
That's not for her.
She's not one of us.
Then why did you come?
Didn't you come back here for it?
So what will you do now?
I couldn't go on.
And how are you?
This isn't just about you any more.
I don't want you here.
And I don't need your help.
I have one more thing to do.
They couldn't do anything for me.
Now do you get to see her?
Do you feel okay.
I don't like him very much.
What do you want him for?
I can see her.
I've got him if you want him.
I know of no one.
It's all in there.
You might say that.
I thought he said it all the time.
It's not you it's me.
Well here it is.
I don't take it back.
And that's a bad thing?
I'd like to take you out.
Is that the last thing you need?
Where did you say she's from?
Well did you like it?
Why didn't you do something?
I don't think you want to know.
You'd do that for me?
I do like him.
Well do you like him?
See that wasn't so bad.
For the first time yes.
You think he'll like it?
I see right through you.
Is she with you?
If not for me then do it for you.
And I don't.
For her first time?
She wouldn't say.
I just didn't feel right about it.
So that's what this is all about.
You don't mean?
Do you know when she'll be back?
Do you know where she is?
You got to go.
How will I get to her?
I hope you'll come to see us.
Do you know the people?
We've got to go on.
Well you know where it is.
You mean you didn't.
I think I should.
She shouldn't be up there.
Are you coming to see us.
Where do you see her?
She's there just like I said she'd be.
Would she be there now?
These are all from me.
What do you want.
Oh it is it is!
I know what they mean!
Oh yes they do.
I can not tell you.
But where is that?
But where do you come from?
But who are you?
Why doesn't it get up?
You get me to go with you when you want to come here.
You couldn't see me but I could see you.
You've got to come with me.
What's with her?
It's always something.
You'll get through this.
So what do I do?
The thing is I really like him.
No way could you have done that.
It's just as well.
I don't know much about him.
When did you see him?
You don't think so?
So did you do it?
I never thought of it like that.
It's how you feel.
Do you really need these?
This really isn't a good time.
I know you're in there.
You never say that.
I mean you look good.
We can work this out.
I don't think you would.
If you don't like me just say so.
I mean no not really.
I want to help.
No it's a good thing.
You didn't say it.
Like I had to say it?
Is that how you feel?
No I got it.
What are they for?
What does that have to do with me?
Come on she's not here.
Take what you need.
That's not all.
Don't know much do you?
I don't know who they are.
I don't know how I got there.
You are doing it!
I'm here to help.
What does she say?
It's like there was never anything there.
You know something about me?
What you've done?
Don't say a .
Just what you think I mean.
Just make something up.
I don't think so
Why would they do that.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Do you want to tell him that?
That's all I have.
So this is it?
I'm okay from here.
I shouldn't be here.
I mean what is it?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Then why did you come here?
Don't you see.
And if I don't?
We have to go on.
We know what's down there.
I need help and so do you.
I can work here.
It's because of me.
No time for that.
What do you mean you don't know?
You're not like that.
It was just me.
Okay so I don't like it any more than you do.
It's not all right.
Then come with me.
Look I've got to go.
That's how you always know when it's right.
That's two years!
What I have to do.
That is where they should be.
Then you can help him.
Don't you think you could be?
I'm not like that.
No I want you in.
Not just say you're in.
And now he will?
What's it got to do with you?
What I want to do!
I mean isn't that what this is all about?
I don't want to do it.
Don't you want to do something about it?
I just don't want to come.
What is it then?
It's not going to help us!
How do we get out of here?
You want ME to go up there?
How do we do it?
How do we get there?
I didn't have to come back.
I don't know where it is!
He's with them.
Now look what you did!
And what have you come up with?
You want some too?
There's you him and me!!
What's there to think about??
We're all going.
What's this for?
I mean what do you know?
I mean what do you think?
I'll get it!
Just so you know.
She's in back.
Now he's back.
And look what he does!
What do you mean Oh well?!
He did it again!
I'll be out.
Is that what it is?
I don't know what that's from.
That wasn't anything.
Don't say no.
You do this for money?
You have to think about this.
You have to do it.
Okay you're right.
I'm doing that too.
They could be up there right now!
Well where's he from?
Is he from here?
I think about it all.
You think about it?
What do you mean no??
I'm going to take you in.
Did you get one?
How can you need me?
How's it with you?
Just like it always was!
How's it feel to be back?
We'll be right here right with you.
I'd think about it.
I want to know who put you up to it.
I'm about to go on.
We'll work things out when the time is right.
I wouldn't know why.
I can help you.
He never did time.
That's what you got.
Who would want to do that to you?
That's when we'll get him.
It's about to go down.
And don't you do it again.
What you think about it?
Why don't they come?
I'm through with you.
Oh I see what you mean.
Yes I might do that.
Yes why shouldn't it?
You make them work for you.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
That's what we said.
But we'll make out.
Do you really think that?
I mean it I tell you.
And why should I?
She'll do all right.
No really thank you.
You have said it.
I'll be there too!
That isn't it.
What is it don't work out that way?
So why didn't you come?
Don't you think I know that!
I can give him to you.
I don't know it!
This is what this is about?
Put it down now.
So that's what it was.
I think it's me.
You get all that?
You still with us?
What do they put in these things?
You're coming in!
We're going in.
You'll be okay.
Did I do something to make you do that?
I don't know if I have or not.
That's good then.
They're really nice people.
He didn't do it.
And you don't tell me?
Then what do you want me to say?
How did they think that?
What do you mean.
Would you do something for me?
I know I am.
So I don't know.
I am going to get out.
That would be all right too!
So how are you?
I never thought I'd get out this way.
I don't know what to say to him.
But he did it.
I thought it would help me but it didn't.
What good is that?
I'll see what they'll do.
Okay what do you give me?
What hope you got?
I want you to see this.
I want you to see something.
You're all one way!
What do you want to know that for?
I don't know what we do now.
Okay you're in there and we're out here.
We like you too.
You're not okay look at you.
What if I take you with me?
It's all we got.
Well you're okay?
No that's all.
Do what you want to do.
Does that still go?
What did we say?
What did we say!
But I want to know what you think.
I want him to think that.
But do you mean in?
But do you mean it?
You give us one more now.
Okay - you got your one.
Could you come out please?
I wouldn't like to but I will if I have to.
I have to see.
I want them all.
Okay when do I get them?
She doesn't have anything to do with it!
You could give up.
What do you want us to give you?
It's where they got the money.
I want to see them.
Then so be it.
Something is going down.
You got my back.
What did he do this time?
I don't know how he does it.
What can you say?
I'll see you out.
This might take some time.
That's right on time.
Who doesn't work?
To get my money.
I work too but I still make time.
Who don't work?
You think you know it all?
Well you don't.
No I'm not it.
I'll tell you why!
Then I'm in.
I couldn't be more okay.
Well I'll tell you what I think.
I don't think they do.
Why didn't you tell me.
You wouldn't get it.
Say what I say.
How do you know it's for us?
Can he do that?
You take that back!
Yeah it's nice.
Well what have we here?
Oh I think you do.
You're coming too.
I know where that is.
So when can we do it?
Oh yeah give it to me.
You know I do!
Have you got what I want?
I think you did it.
Yeah I get it.
Just have a look at this.
You've done it all.
Why didn't you tell us!
I can see it.
Where are we do you think?
Why do they come?
Well he isn't!
He will look where we cannot.
No you look good.
And you should come with me.
That's all I've got.
You come out here.
So why didn't you do it?
So how'd we do?
Is there anything I can get you?
Do I have to get on one?
I am always on time.
Do you want me to get it for you?
I don't work here.
Will he be okay?
Now that it's done so am I.
How much money did he put up?
What did you want me to say?
I'm no good.
Well I'd really like to know what you think.
And he's really nice.
What if I just don't have it?
Just it doesn't look like very much.
And she no like.
So did you like it?
Should he tell her?
Should he not tell her?
No no not at all!
And I'm good.
I might as well be.
They're very nice.
Oh it's you again.
Isn't that the same thing?
You thought it was me?
Well now I will.
They know what they're doing.
You don't do that.
I want you to take this.
Where were you then?
He's who we want to go with.
She's coming right back out.
Can I see her?
I'm doing all right.
You know who we are?
It's been years.
He didn't know.
And what did he come back now for?
She wouldn't tell me.
Well when will she be back?
What is she at work?
That's - where is she is she all right?
But you know what could I do?
What's going on who is that?
You would do this?
Can I help with anything?
I just got to get it out there.
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to know that.
I mean you know.
I'll be back
I have other things going on too you know.
I just have to get something.
I want you to do something for me.
Coming to see me.
Did I do that too?
All I know is I did it I
And when did you do it?
I'm the one.
Because I know who did it.
Should we get a what?
Could you get this?
Just one more thing.
I don't like where you're going.
I don't want any money.
When can you get it here?
I don't know who he is.
Same way they did with you and me.
How do you know so much?
You don't get it.
What'd they do to you?
You know these people I don't.
That's who they are.
What do they have to do with this?
Well then who can?
I think she'll like this very much.
I don't know anything about this.
Do you see anything you like?
Not that I could see.
Did he give you anything?
Because I don't know.
I thought you might know something.
I want you to do it right now.
I'll see if I can you know work things out.
It's not me?
You're just what I need right now.
He doesn't work that way.
So you've said.
Yeah what's going on?
What does that have to do with you?
And if it wasn't?
Now it's not.
We've got to get you out of here.
This is - what is this?
Will you please come in?
Will you not come in?
No but I think I do.
Do they know them?
I should like to have them.
This is not very good is it?
There's really no need.
I'd like you to have them.
You mean you - or me?
Come on what did he say?
And the people here don't want us.
I haven't no.
I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.
There you have me.
Good we're all here?
Look - give me something.
I can get in the back.
How could he have?
And so is he.
I don't think he is.
We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back or -
I could help you.
To come back for her.
Is that what you thought?
Would you like me to?
I don't think it does.
How can you see anything?
You don't have any money do you?
And that I don't think I can.
Is that what you think I think?
I've done this.
I've had to do this.
It's okay - I'll help.
No but no not at all.
For all of us.
Does he have to go?
Only we have to go to work.
Go on do it.
What have I been doing all this time?
I was with them for some time.
I know what I'm doing.
Why didn't I think of that?
You could come too.
There is one more thing.
Where the money is.
From them to us.
Do you know what you've done!?
That's where the money is.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
He'd always be there for me.
No no I want to.
Oh I think you can do it.
I'll need that.
Look I can help.
You've got one.
That's when we'll do it.
I know it well.
We're only going one way.
It's one way.
Look on the back.
Why would I be?
It is can it be?
Doesn't look like much.
I need you to get one more thing for me.
And you do it so well.
There's more than one?
Why would they do that?
I just work for them.
I got a little something for you too.
Still a lot of money.
And what do you do for me?
That's why I like it.
That's just not right.
Then they didn't know.
They had to know.
It didn't help but no.
I'll take it on.
You think there's more?
We can get these people.
Okay so here's what I'll do.
Because I said no.
I don't get why they'd do that.
Well that was nice of him.
That's not how we work here.
You do know how to do that don't you?
Would that be okay?
What would you get?
What's going on in there?
You always say that.
More than you need me.
I never had that.
People do it all the time.
Take her will you?
I work when I need to.
I'm never here.
You got more than one?
Now don't be like that.
But it's good for me.
And it's good for you too.
So it's good?
No one put me up to anything.
He did didn't he?
He can do it.
I can help them!
I don't want your help.
Or I'll help you not.
I'm going to have a look.
I'm going to see what it is.
There will be more of them.
Just what we need right now.
There's something out there!
You always know what they're going to do.
I've done what I can for you.
He doesn't want you at all.
Not as well as I'd like.
We're not going back there.
I didn't say anything?
I'll get us going.
What have we here?
Only what you take with you.
This will not do.
But he isn't us.
We don't know how.
We have things to do.
It's so good to see you again.
And we get out.
What's in it for me?
So you want me to take her out?
So what does this thing do?
I'll need to know more about this thing.
And I don't need to know.
Only on a need to know.
Don't like it don't come.
I don't know about this thing.
Where are they going?
I want you out.
What're you doing in here?
For now there is no one.
You are that and much more.
I think we do too.
He can be no other.
But I'm here.
Who will it be?
What's this what's this?
You and only you.
Yes yes I know that.
Help me get up.
I want to thank you.
That I cannot.
You know what I want.
I have come for him.
What's he doing there?
Where do you want this?
Did you put it there?
Didn't who tell me?
What didn't he tell you?
It's for me.
So how could this be?
We still don't know.
She is going to be well?
Yes I go now.
I'd tell you.
Did you see her or not?
Tell me something good.
Well I think you should.
You tell me that!
I'll have to look it up.
Oh will you help her!
Could you see her?
I didn't get you?
No I wouldn't.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
No I didn't know you had one.
I don't know I just thought.
But you like him.
Yeah I like him.
Well you know it's okay.
Well what would you like to do?
I don't know
Oh look at that.
When can I have one?
I should of been there and I wasn't there I should've been there.
Where'd you get it then?
Would you like to go?
I am no one!
You'd like that?
Can you give her something?
There's only one.
You know who I think really did it?
That's to bad.
You'd know that.
Well look at this.
What do you do to him?
We wouldn't want that would we?
Isn't there something you can give him?
Two at a time?
Oh look at you two.
When they coming in?
No it's not that.
I wasn't there.
But he didn't want me to.
You could've come.
When's the last time we were there?
They want us back.
What're you doing down here?
I never see her.
What's it look like I'm doing?
Thank you thank you.
I don't think I know what you mean.
No you take the right.
Yeah well what can I say?
Here how's this?
Yeah well Your's isn't.
She'll get here.
Yeah and what put him up there?
That how you see it?
So you'll come out right?
So what'd we get her?
She didn't know what she was doing.
Come on we're on.
I always get here.
So what'd you think?
We would've come and got you.
How should I take it?
What's with you two?
That was something wasn't it?
He's always right.
Here how about this?
I think that's all we need to know.
Yes well they are.
I'll take a look.
You want to know if he's okay.
Yeah well couldn't I take a look now?
Is that the way it is?
And you don't?
If I see him.
So what's it doing here?
You don't know good.
All I said was you were good.
So why's he do it?
Why would he need more?
That's what they always say.
How could you do this to us?
I don't know that.
You said you'd be here!
And you wouldn't be.
I haven't had time.
I'd like to be here for you.
You can have it back.
Like you know anything about it.
You have something I want.
Where should I be?
All of them do.
That's what I'd like to know.
But you aren't going to like it.
Isn't that what all this is about?
And I know people.
You know that right?
Where do I go now?
You look just like him.
But what do I do?
Do I look like I need your money.
You still think this is about me don't you?
You got it all.
I know about this!
It would help me if we were.
I want to do that.
I need to tell you something.
How would you look at it?
Would you like to come?
I'd like that too.
I want to see you again.
Am I good or what?
We've got to take them out!
Why don't you go on.
You're going out there?
He should be up and about in no time.
That's why you're really here.
I've got to get out!
Then why not take it?
No there's no other way.
Just what it is.
There's no other way.
Tell them to take us out.
Just in and out.
And we need more money.
What the - how's -
Okay so there's that.
Well okay it's -
Come on down and get it!
I couldn't really say.
What're they doing?
Well I would know.
Well you can help me.
Know who this is?
Why wouldn't we be?
It's in the lot there.
I know it's a lot.
Well that's okay I just -
Don't go in!
We've got a -
So it's nice up there?
Really what's that?
Some of it yes.
Who do you think could've done this?
I did I think.
He's not here!
Might've been too much.
I'm on to you.
You're the one who did this to me.
How have you been?
Do something for me.
You know you will.
I'm doing this for us.
I thank you I really do.
How'd you do that?!
If you know I know.
I wouldn't be doing that.
Now look what you've done!
Why do people think anything?
Why do people think I'm you?
Is it about you and me?
I thought you did.
Do what you like.
It's right here.
And you'll never see me again.
You're okay with this?
Where do you want it?
That's a good thing isn't it?
I don't know about this.
There's always that.
There is no money.
No it's not here.
You have to tell us now.
It's not just about me.
We'll get through this.
Who does he think he is?
Look you weren't there.
Wouldn't say where she was going.
Here's what I don't get.
I can feel it too.
Like I said it was like I was there.
You have to do something!
No I'm good.
Would you take these?
You know what to do.
I mean I don't have anything on me.
No but it might as well be the same thing.
Look there's something you should all know.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
I know what you're doing!
How come he didn't take me?
I know a lot of them aren't there.
I couldn't get you in.
I go with you.
How you going to get there?
Why'd they want us?
It's nice there.
I thought he was with you.
All this is for us?
But it had to look good.
Come to get you out.
What did you want?
Am I out of here?
Well don't say it like that.
Where did you get them done?
Well did you or didn't you?
What have you been doing here!
What have you been doing here?
I just said all I want is some time.
So what time do you need?
Where have I been?
So what's going on?
You think it'll work out?
What are you two up to?
I Do Not Need This!
There's no way to tell.
Can you tell me something?
No I have to work.
I'll say no.
So how do we do this?
Don't you think it's time to go now?
You going to help me?
First the money now this.
You really want to help me?
I mean what's it going to take!
They work for Him.
I've got a right to say something.
I'm the one what?
They said you're The One.
Oh no I want to.
What are we about to do?
I never say anything I have to.
There isn't any more to tell.
I have to see how things are first.
We can still have a good time.
I hope they do.
I didn't get it did I?
People that's who!
But what about me?
I don't know where she is!
The way I look?
Well I don't mean to.
You always do this to me.
I hope it will yes.
I mean what would it come to?
You have to tell me that.
I have to tell you that.
Yeah I think I could.
That's what you said?
No it isn't what I think.
I think it's what you think.
No you're very good at it.
I didn't have any.
What would I do with it?
What have I been doing?
Now where are we?
Well thank you that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Oh no it's been much more than that.
Who's on him?
Well I think you do.
This is what we do.
Something I need to tell you about.
This isn't what you think.
We need to do that.
Okay I'm on it.
You got it you got it!
No but we can.
I don't think I can.
All right I'm with you.
Do you know who he is?
What do I tell them?
So what should I do?
That'll never work.
We're doing good.
It's really you isn't it?
What'd you just say?
But because of you.
Don't do that to me!
It's all right you're all right.
I'm with you.
I couldn't see anything.
No one would tell me anything.
And what about us?
Why did you come back here?
Is that so bad?
You know what I've been through.
You don't to say it.
I just want you to like me.
Don't say any more.
Why don't you help us?
In that little thing?
He didn't say anything?
Yeah we're here.
I still don't get it.
Doesn't that tell you something?
You got me where you want me.
That's it we're done.
You know why I need you.
Look I don't want your money!
I don't think you know who I am.
She said she had something to tell me.
She didn't want anything to do with you.
I mean really never.
And I'll never do it again.
And you'll never do it again.
Oh I can see that.
You can and you will!
We'll be okay.
I didn't mean for you to go!
What do you mean??
You are going where?
Had to be him.
But she wouldn't tell me who.
Not that we really mean it.
He's not only out there.
You say we go?
I say we go.
And he was there?
Tell me how bad you feel.
This could be it.
Can he get through it?
I'll see you all the time.
But I just need one.
So why don't you tell me?
First you tell me.
You know why don't you?
What's been going on?
This could be it!
I don't know if I can say that.
So what are you going to do about it?
And that's us.
Who we were and where we come from.
I like coming back.
I'll go get you another one.
And for you too.
I have to know what you think.
You'll need these.
How did we do it?
If it's you what are you doing here?
What does that tell me?
Go on tell him.
You see what you're doing don't you?
But I know you don't I?
That's so what.
Do you think he can do it?
But you're here.
I haven't come to you.
You've come to me.
Some of it good I hope.
I've come here to think about it.
I know you are right.
I don't know that this is right.
We need your help!
Where are you going.
How have you done any of this?
That's why he did it.
Do you need any more than that?
Something I could never do.
Do you know where he is?
Why have you done this?
No but you might need them when you get back.
She doesn't have to know.
She doesn't want to know.
I don't feel too good.
What is that one?
You really need that much?
I have to know where you come from.
There's a way.
You've never been here?
I didn't mean anything.
But then who know what he could do.
Not like this one.
I'm not doing it.
Are we going to make it?
You'll feel okay.
I don't see how.
We got to go one way or another.
I want to say something.
We're going to make it.
That would be the first time.
You don't like the way things are I don't like the way things
When I got out why didn't you tell me where it was?
Do it my way.
I don't want to go there.
You know how I feel?
I had a lot of that.
I had a lot of that too.
But I got you out.
I got you out.
We've got time.
We've got a lot of time.
You go out much?
That's not all of it.
I'll never make another one.
You've never been there.
It doesn't look like that.
I've got to get out now.
Hope you do too.
Hope you get to where you're going.
I'm good at that.
You were with him?
Then you do it.
I'll tell you when.
It was the only way I could get at them.
People put money in.
I take it out.
Who do I have to thank?
You've just got time.
Look I'm me right.
We are what we are like it or not.
He was all right to me.
It's not like that.
Shouldn't think so.
Is he coming here?
We're there now.
And what was that?
How'd you know where I'd be?
No do you really?
I know him too.
I work for him.
I should be at work.
Nice of you to come.
You all right now?
Oh what you doing now?
He was always the same.
I mean what for?
He was always on time.
What you going to do?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What'll they do to him?
And what you going to do?
And who's he?
You don't look it.
I didn't like that.
They're still the same.
So what're you doing?
Things to see to.
Is that what I just said?
That's something I have to do.
They come to you.
Why would I do it?
Why would they come to me?
What will they know?
You have to go in.
He would take you on.
Have I said that?
What could we get for them?
Should do something to them.
Of doing the thing.
You had to yeah.
Where am I going to work?
You know who doesn't?
Why don't you think so?
Will you get out of here.
Would you come in here please?
If you please I'll be back in.
No I think I don't want your money.
Do I have to tell you?
How much did you get for them?
You want to go in there?
Now how did you know that?
Well hadn't it?
Because I say so.
What are we going to say?
I'll tell you why I'm out.
I need them now.
What about the other two?
That's all it is.
That's what it does that's all it's doing.
That's all I want to say.
We know what he is.
Is that the thing?
You said the one.
You take your time and if you still feel.
And see what's coming.
I want to tell you something.
You tell me what it is.
You tell me again.
That's what they are.
We're not the same.
We are not the same.
If you think there is then be that thing.
Is that what I did?
And you'd be right.
You put me in with him.
If you don't want it give it back.
No where is it?
I think he would.
Because I need MONEY!
Then why do you come to me?
Yeah but I don't want him to see you.
I've been out of work.
What about now is there anything you can help me out with?
I didn't know all that much.
NO no I don't know anything.
Didn't you know that?
What did I tell you.
Make him look bad.
No I didn't know.
That's not the way we look at it.
Will you tell him?
Tell him how you feel.
He doesn't want my help any more.
He doesn't need it.
Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Go on tell me.
They can come in now.
What was it so I'll know.
Don't you know me?
And that's all he had to do.
There are still things I have to do.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
What is it I can do for you?
I didn't want you to know I was coming.
No she's here.
Am I going to put out or not?
I still have time to get things right.
But I didn't do this!
This wasn't me.
He's not there?
What have you done with him?
That is what I hope.
You and he are not doing things?
You did not know?
Something I can do for you?
Something make you think I'm not?
Oh but you have.
I'm not that way.
It's not like her.
Is that really her?
Do I look okay?
Why do I tell you this?
Too much can be a very bad thing.
What way might that be?
You don't think of me that way do you?
I never thought you were.
I'm not you know.
Where did I get that?
What have you done this time?
I never said you were.
Who do you think?
But I had to.
I hope you know what you're doing.
But I want you out of here.
You know my back.
But you shouldn't be here.
Get out of here then.
You don't have anything on me.
You know my back -
How is that one?
What are you doing back?
We'll be doing some work out your way.
It was right here.
Then where is it?
Know something's up.
I can see that -
She does have one thing you don't.
What's with the look?
No we don't -
It can be done.
You think it can be done?
You know what you got here?
You think I don't know?
I really don't know what to say.
That's just my way.
See now this doesn't feel right.
Is this a bad time?
I'm good like that.
What'd you say about me?
WILL So don't go.
How much money you got?
You don't got any money on you right now.
Good it was all right.
Come on that's what you do.
And what do you see?
Yeah can I help you?
I can come back.
That's right Will.
I'll do the work.
Could you help us?
How about one now?
Do you know when you'll be back?
He's not you!
It's not about that!
I know who I am.
Now don't do that.
Don't you do that!
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Well you're the only one.
Now you know Will and I know what you need to be doing.
You did your time.
That's what you want?
Well I'm here.
You're right Will.
But you could do anything you want.
Not to me they're not.
What did I think?
And I wasn't one of them.
When did you know she was the one?
We have a really good time.
Well are you going out again?
Tell me what you really think.
Yes I do Will.
Oh is that what this is about?
You think I want this?
I just feel it.
Yeah but how do you know?
I want you to come with me.
This is what I'm doing with that money.
Want me to take a look?
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Okay you got me.
Well look I have to go.
She got to make it.
You can come on.
If they could we could.
What'd he look like again?
Can all of you work?
If you want it take it.
They don't get in here.
Not much but we had it.
But I don't know how.
We come to work here.
I'll go your way.
I'd do what I done again.
There's just what people do.
But not no more.
Okay for this one.
Want to work do you?
We got to go.
Take her with you!
No it don't.
Then you can come out.
I know I shouldn't.
Yes'm that was it.
Some say I am.
But who done it?
If I did I'd tell you.
How you get all this money?
But what about this?
I didn't go to do it!
Now you done it!
So what are you doing now?
That's for you.
You don't get to have me.
What if I come back?
Is it something you've done?
I have to give this some thought.
That'd be good.
Well there's not much to tell.
It's always the little things.
But I'll come back.
That's about it really.
Here is now there.
Up on the right.
I'm right about that aren't I?
Do you like the people you work with?
This is not good.
And they want me to make up for it.
No I don't have one.
It didn't work out.
Then what have we been doing?
Yeah I think it is.
Why didn't it work out?
You look all right.
Well he don't know that.
You want us to come with you?
Because I was the only one.
I was just me.
I don't know where you got it?
Who's going to want me now?
Yeah he's going to think about it.
I know you think it is but it's not.
He doesn't have to!
Did he tell you that?
Don't you think I can tell what's going on?
It's about you!
Who do you think I'm doing this for?
I'm doing this for you!
Is this it now?
Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
This'll be nice.
Would you like to see that?
I didn't know I had to.
No I don't mean you have to.
I think we should.
Well what are you going to do?
I don't want to come back that's all.
I have so much to tell you.
But you don't know how you feel about me.
You were right about coming here.
Well it's good that you're there.
I don't know how I'm going to do it.
No that's not what I said.
If you feel you should come then come.
She will if you think she should.
What if she doesn't want to go?
I just know it!
I think it would be good for her.
You just said he said no.
Why did you go?
No I'll go.
I should go get some of her things.
Is there anything you need?
It's like going back in time.
You're all doing too much.
Just do what you can.
I just don't know right now!
What does she do?
I just could never say it!
You think the same thing!
We still have a way to go.
I was always good.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Don't you know anything?
But he does know things.
No don't know who he is.
You know who he is?
And what's he do?
Just give it up.
What can I tell you.
I'll make it up to you!
Why did he come to you?
I didn't know what was on it.
I really need your help.
I said give me time.
I think we've got something.
Will you take a look for me?
You know you're right about that.
What is he doing in here?
How much do they know?
I'll take you down there.
No no we have to get out of here right now.
Are you two okay?
Why shouldn't I?
Like the last time?
I've got you come on go down.
I didn't mean it like that.
If I wasn't here you could go out.
I've just been there.
You'll have to.
Tell me you didn't.
Why didn't you say anything?
You never go out.
Is that all you say?
DO WHAT I SAY!
I can see why.
Well go tell her it's me okay?
Will you get her for me?
How could he get there?
And tell them where he's going.
You want to see some?
I didn't know what to say.
Oh is that what it is?
No really I really like him a lot.
Oh what what do you do?
This time I really think I have something.
Not that you need me.
Oh all the time.
I know it isn't.
I thought you weren't coming.
Oh please I have to go.
I will work things out.
Not because of me I hope.
There's so much that I want to tell you.
Oh yeah that's really nice of you.
You'd have a good time.
I know you would.
That's too much.
I'd like to get you this.
No I don't have time.
If you don't know about it you should.
Oh you know what?
He didn't come.
Well what do you do?
Well what is it then?
I want one with you.
Oh couldn't you say something?
Oh yes you have!
Because I have to!
Oh you know what.
I was but I'm not.
Oh me I'm okay.
That's really nice!
Oh what do they know?
No I didn't I that's no.
No I didn't mean that.
Well I mean why not?
Well I I really like that.
Well how about this?
Don't you think she does?
Will you just tell me one thing?
When'd you get here?
Just you know tell me what you think.
It wasn't anything bad.
So what's it about?
I don't know why it would.
You want me to be?
I did not last with him.
What have they got you doing?
You know why that is?
Then you tell me then.
Yeah so where is he?
He will come to her.
Why did he come back?
You know I will.
I know you did what you could.
Why would you say that?
How could you know?
Why did you look at me that way?
THEN WHERE WAS IT?
And how did he do that?
You're going to do that?
That's what I should do.
Then we cannot go.
I want the money.
I know where he is.
But they were not there.
That's what he was.
That's really all we have time for.
Yes so you said.
Why have you come back to see me?
You haven't done it.
And that's all there is.
I have not I would not.
You can look at me.
What did I do this time?
I'm right right?
That would be a No.
I have to get up.
Still more to do.
Never one like this.
Oh yeah that's it.
I'll do your thing.
Come on it'll be Very.
I think you can.
Yeah I just got back.
Because I can be!
Okay I'm going I'm going.
I could be up for that.
So are we on?
You'll be back!
I'll get him back!
They should shouldn't they?
Thank you so much!
I've got one.
Did he tell you?
I mean very bad.
I did more then that.
So I'm done.
Yeah how's that?
Where are you going with this?
Where's is it?
Really why's that?
Never to put you in my will.
It's coming out.
I don't know who you are or what you want.
And that thing is this:
But that's what I need.
What things do you think you've done?
I don't know what I'm doing here.
That's what we need to do now.
You should go in.
I never really thought they'd go for it.
I got some of it.
She don't like me to see him.
I mean you wouldn't do it.
She's still like that right?
Were you in it?
Now you help me up.
No I don't have the right.
And it's me!
He'll do it.
Where'd we put him?
It's really up to you.
And what about work?
Isn't that always the way?
Yes he did and I don't like it any more than you do.
There's still a lot I want to do.
Look I think we should work things out.
He wasn't there.
Well what about these?
We're going to think about it.
But it's what we want.
You didn't see this.
I'd like you to see this.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.
You can go first.
You always get to go first.
The only thing you can do.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
You look but you do not see.
This cannot be.
What more need I know?
Can you really tell from doing that?
Then take me with you.
You'll no see me again.
He's in there!
Where will you go now?
Do you know who they are?
You look like you have.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
I like my work.
Then why don't you go out?
I shouldn't have come back here.
We have to give up.
There is no way out.
We should give up.
All we have to do is take one.
We been through that.
I'll give you these people.
I got these people!
You got something to say?
We don't have time!
We can take it with us.
That's how we'll get to him.
You said they would be here!
You can see they're okay.
Tell me about you.
No one's coming.
You can do anything you want right now.
How can we get out?
Do you want to go or not?
I know the one.
He didn't say.
One at a time!
What does he have on you?
I know why I'm doing this but what does he have on you?
What are you people going to do?
I need your help with something.
Don't you know that?
It will be me.
I'll tell you what to do.
My people are good to go.
You know who I mean?
We who is we?
I don't have it here.
I can get it for you.
I don't have that much.
Why not take some money for your work?
Who will tell them?
They can go where they want.
Come and I will get them for you.
Please I have money.
I will see what I can do.
I thought you'd like it.
When will they be here?
I would never do that.
Get in there now.
That will take time.
He will be here.
I cannot do this.
Tell me what it was.
How much for this?
How can we help him.
Put these people in them.
No I could not.
I couldn't help.
I will get you out of here.
What do we do with all these people?
What do you mean all?
Can I go see it?
If you know where it is get there!
What's down there?
And we get this money when?
Where did it go?
It'll have to do.
They're all here!
And then where are we?
Then who are they?
And you think it's in there?
I said we shouldn't come down here.
No you don't want to go down there.
I am going down there.
I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Don't know that it does.
It doesn't say.
There's no need to be.
What will they tell you?
Well then who did?
Take me to her.
She's in there!
We're not going.
You don't think I know?
Well what do you think it is?
I think that's what I need too.
What do we do about it?
I think we should do it.
Well that's what we're here for.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Did you know her very well?
Well what is it!
There's something in there.
Not at all if it can help.
So is that what all this is?
And what would you do?
But that's all it is.
So where is it?
Then tell me what to do.
What will he do?
And why are you back?
Do you know where we are?
But you know more than I do.
But I don't know what's going on.
But he wasn't.
Didn't look back.
It was really good.
But I don't know anything!
No you know you do.
Yeah who is this?
Can I like GO now?
I was just there!
Right at the back there.
But can you tell us anything about it?
Because you want to.
The same as I.
See how we feel.
This wasn't here.
I'd like to put things right.
Don't tell me you haven't thought about me.
It doesn't have to be.
Why not just go now?
What am I doing here?
That's the first thing I did.
Well what's this?
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!
what's that up there?
Why did he do it?!
Things were going so well!
I don't mean that!
How did you know who I am?
Well that just about does it!
You mean you know about this?
Oh is that it!
Why yes do you know it?
I like to think so!
Yeah tell me about it.
But I like to do it.
You don't have to do that for me.
You mean too much to us here.
But you didn't have to come up here.
But how did you get here?
But now we've got to get you back there.
I think you need some help.
You will be you are.
You know what she is!
Does she know what she is?
But don't you have to work?
You'll like her.
Why should that mean anything to you?
And now that I'm here I don't know how.
Why did you come in here?
Then again why should she be?
Why shouldn't she be?
I don't know how to take this.
Well here you are.
One for you and one for me.
Am I right or am I right?
See no one's here.
That's all for now.
But here's the thing.
I could say the same thing about you.
Don't feel that much.
What time was that?
Like I said no.
Not that much at first.
You know what about.
She didn't tell me.
That he was going to take her!
She wouldn't tell me!
You see too much.
We can do that?
I want things to be as they were.
Tell me how it was done!!!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME???
But it wasn't always so!
And so was I!
You would be something other than you are?
But now he's not.
yes that's it.
I want some more.
I cannot do it!
That's not so.
I can feel it from them!
She doesn't know where she is.
I know they are.
Or her or her - or any of them?
Is that what you still think I am?
I did it for you -
You've come again to me?
Don't do this thing!!
You don't want it to go on.
I like to do it.
What you wouldn't do.
They know about us.
What have you done to me?
You really want to be with them?
But why do you want me?
But if I were what would I want with you?
That's who you are.
You've just done it -
Give it to me!!
There is no more to tell.
She had to know.
But why did you tell her?
But there was more to it than that.
I can look on anything I like.
The same way you do it.
I should go up there.
I got work to do.
Come on you can make it.
I've got to see.
Did you tell him I'd be here?
You know me to well.
Never do that again.
I don't think I can do it.
I want to go back.
It just isn't.
Oh that's Will.
You'd like him.
He was right there.
It's always about you.
Did you get help?
I'm with her.
Where there's a Will there's a way.
And do what with it?
So why are you still here?
Thank you I'll do that.
You wouldn't tell that
What if he is?
No I want more than that.
She's not too well.
We will know what to do then.
We have no time for that.
But that should make you like her.
Oh now now look here
She is not there.
A lot of these people are out of work.
Come on we got to get this up.
I don't know how you know these things but tell me where is she?
What do you mean I wasn't there?
Well you got any money?
It isn't me!
Yeah that'll do it.
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you .
Only one way you can help me.
Well who are you then?
Oh I know all about you.
Go through with what?
Well I did didn't I?
You didn't go through with it did you?
He didn't go.
Now look I'll help you out.
I don't see a thing.
It was up there.
Oh look at this.
When'd you see him last?
Oh no you don't feel so good.
The last time he come in here.
Well then how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Anything I can do back here?
Then get out of here.
She was here first.
Well how do you do.
I'd like to do that.
Well I've said too much.
You do what you want with this thing.
What does that get us?
Well I'll tell him.
Have you got any money?
Oh I don't know .
why not right here?
That does it come here.
You know what we're going to do?
Well are you coming in or aren't you?
Didn't you tell her?
Well how did she know?
Come on tell me.
Oh no don't.
Well why don't you say it?
I'm not very good at this.
That wasn't you.
You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Oh no you don't.
How about that one there?
But we had it!
You coming up on him?
I thought you said she was going with us?
It's still there!
I'm going out there.
He'll do it for me.
I know just where to go.
You're going in with me.
All of us thank you okay?
Not when it's like this.
Okay so that's it.
We don't know that do we?
They didn't see it.
It was bad wasn't it.
I did I did.
Might still be there.
I don't want them out there.
Just do it all right?
It's all right we're okay.
So why aren't they doing it now?
Well I'm not doing anything with him.
Now I really want to see it.
Are you going out?
I will I will.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
They'll be there when we get there.
Come on back up here!
I can go out if I want to.
If you don't want to take me just say so.
Is there something I don't know about?
When are we going out?
Would you take him?
I'm not in the way.
You're going out.
I don't need you.
You should've been out there.
Don't feel bad.
Go on you're tired.
Never know down there.
She doesn't need you.
I'm the only one that can do it.
Who's going to do it?
They have to have it.
What do you mean we don't?
Well that's why you got it.
No I'm not going through there.
No we'll go through here.
Would you do that for me?
They said you'd be here.
You're going down there again?
The look in them?
You would wouldn't you?
They're coming with us?
He doesn't need the money.
I don't like what he does.
Yeah you really don't like him.
I'll see to it.
We have to get them out!
How'd it get in here?
Yes aren't we all.
Have them do some.
I think they'll come out now.
Now what's this do?
I don't want to go in it okay?
Did you see me?!
This is where to be.
I never go in it.
So you just get here?
That's how they do it you know.
Yeah well I didn't!
Yeah he'll really go for that.
Why didn't you tell us?
We're going down.
I'm not doing anything.
Why'd you come out here?
All you all right?
It's just something I feel.
I'll get her.
How come only me?
You'll have time to get up.
What do you know about him?
What she's got.
Well with me it's all right.
You see if I don't.
You see if she isn't.
We're not here.
What if we need a back up?
Did I say he did?
What do you want it for?
But where's my money?
I'm not going up there again.
I think this one could be it?
That's how you think you feel about him.
That's how I feel about him.
You put it in there.
He doesn't need my help.
He don't know that.
I couldn't get out.
I'll get my things.
Anything about him or her?
But not like then.
Well that's who she is.
Said he'd go down and take a look.
I can make this work.
It's all about you isn't it?
I don't like to give up.
Do we really want to do this?
I have to go in.
It's all going to work.
We are so very very back.
I'm just a little.
Oh well why didn't you say so?
I'll give it to you.
Don't I know.
Well this was another way to go.
You know when you know.
I'm out here for you!
You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you.
Help me help you help me help you.
It wasn't just about the money was it?
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?
I'll go back to them.
I don't see any.
Can you see him?
When did you have it last?
We have to help him.
He's this way.
You see that's just the thing.
I want to look for him too.
I CAN GET HIM!
That's the nice thing about them.
What do you do there?
I couldn't see.
Know what this is?
Is that all it's been?
They'll never make it.
Because I didn't know!
No no no no no no .
Why did you want to see me?
Why wouldn't they?
Are you all right?!
Where does it say that?
Because you said so.
I could come with you.
What's he got in there?
People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
You're going too?
They're all the same.
Why did you come here?
GIVE IT TO THEM!
I will not do it.
Oh good that'll take no time.
Well because you're a - - I'm a - -
But you know I should really be the one going .
You have to feel it.
How did you do it?!
How did you do this?
Do you see anything?
Because he's like me.
Up and down up and down!
So I can see them!
Get down right now.
Where does he think he's going?
Why wouldn't they be?
I'm coming to get you!
They're just doing what they do.
No we're okay.
Go that's the way we're going to go.
That's not what I'm going to do.
have anything to say at all!
I really will not.
Yeah you weren't in that last one.
Why did you do this?
I don't know I don't know.
Help me with this.
It's still on.
You think that's going to work?
And if he's not?
Think it'll do any good?
You're not going to be there?
Well that's it.
What is it really?
There is one thing I'd like you to tell me.
Not for other people it's for me.
You didn't give it to me.
Oh don't they?
Just as I did.
I know there is.
We can get help.
I have no right to be I know.
He didn't tell you?
I don't think he really had any.
Isn't it there?
It'll be good for you and good for me.
How could you do this to him?
I don't do it now.
We should never have come!
Is she going with you?
Well she's not now.
Oh you've got to.
There's so much here don't you think?
Didn't want you.
All right the money.
All right not the money.
They didn't want me.
I don't have to look at anything.
We know who did this.
I just want you to tell me.
I said yes I see.
Look why should it be yes or no?
How can you not think so?
You know the things I can do.
I was going to come up.
You're going back?
I said I don't want you to do this.
I didn't think you'd get that!
How do you know how bad it was?
It wasn't that bad.
Oh look what he did in them.
You see he was nice to me.
I mean it wasn't just him.
Is that all you have to say?
The things I do.
The things I could do to you.
Is that how you want it?
You know the people.
Well what're you down about?
You mean because you didn't get me there?
Yeah you got to me.
No I said what did you think.
You said it was!
I don't see anything do you?
Well do you think it was him?
I don't want you to look up.
All right yes I had been.
How is it back there?
It's where it doesn't get me.
They never did really.
Would you like to know what's in it?
You don't tell them.
Why do you want to know all this?
I was doing some work here.
He's right you know.
I'll see him in there.
I see you have people there.
I'll tell you what we'll do okay?
What did you do when you were little?
I hadn't thought much about it.
No she never did.
You mean for good?
Only can I still see him?
Okay I'm here.
Yeah well he did didn't he.
I'm going to be okay.
But it doesn't work that way.
You've got that look.
I don't need another one.
But I'll tell you something.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
But if you want to know what I am.
I'll tell you what I am.
And I just want to know one thing okay?
Didn't she say anything?
I'll tell you what's going on.
Can I do anything I want?
Yes but they say he did.
We do not know.
Where will he go?
Do you have money?
Do I have money?
I will not go.
We will work with what we have.
I need to know what you know.
When it is time.
But you will always be here?
He was always nice to me.
He will come back to you you will see.
You will not come?
I would not know.
I want to go down there.
I do not like you.
And you like me.
You think about that?
I didn't say it like that.
And you didn't see anything?
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
This is what we do?
I want you to go there.
I should get back.
Well you shouldn't have.
I'll get you out!
If I could just -
Who are you please?
I could be there in -
And where he is.
Tell me what you see.
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Why not what can they do?
Why aren't you there right now?
Where were you going?
You know don't you?
And you like him too.
You could get that for me.
Do you know something about him?
And get back to you.
Take her and get out.
Some say that's the way of it.
Who were these people?
You're not coming with us?
Is there another way?
It is the only way.
Is he not tired?
No it's not going through.
How much time does that give us?
They know don't they?
You don't have to take it I just thought it might help.
I want out of here!
When I get out of here I'm going there.
How'd you do that?
Look what's this?
Get back here now.
All right all right so we can say he is good.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know.
You only know that because you need to know.
Who we doing this for?
Should I have something for you?
Where's what I want?
Now where is it?
Yeah one of them's out.
There's no one there.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
What do you mean never?
Well what have they got it for then?
What they like then?
We have work to do.
Well what's going on?
I think we should go and see him.
Well what do you want us to do about it?
Now I think we should go.
What do you mean me?
Why what's up?
That's if I want to see you.
You got it all?
What do you think I am doing?
Where did you get them from?
What have you come as?
And what did she do?
I just don't see you doing it.
I'm only going to have you for two more years.
There wasn't anything I could do.
No it wasn't was it?
Where'd he get all this?
You know who I am?
Go out through the back.
We should just do it.
So where does that put us?
Why would you want to do that?
You get much of that in here?
We've got her.
What are you doing out there?
He had a way.
All you do is work.
Why would I want to go there?
Not if I can help it.
Can I get this?
I had a still.
I mean what did we know about anything?
That's who we were.
We thought we were something didn't we?
They've got me.
I'll see what's going on.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
What's this I see?
You know who it was?
Why you think that was?
You going to tell him?
You going to tell her?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?
But he's not.
Like the look of these?
I've got to help him.
Get him in here!
Make them see things.
It was more than that I think.
Because he had you?
He could have been something more.
Will you be there?
What were you doing up there?
You want more money is that it?
When will she be in?
I want to know why.
She doesn't want to see you.
You know of him?
Then what do you want?
You don't like that.
Have you been in?
Who do you know?
But I don't know you.
That's where we're all going.
And he didn't have them?
He's coming back.
But he didn't know anything.
Why would I want to?
You could still help me do that.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Well I mean it more now.
I don't want to be.
Yeah look at that thing.
It's bad isn't it?
I know but that's what you like about me.
But I'm mean.
But look at you.
No how about you?
I don't know but I can think about it a lot.
Oh what do you do with that?
Is there anything I can do?
Do you think it's done?
I don't know who I .
What time did you make it for?
You have to tell me who did it.
You know how I feel.
Oh thank you thank you so much!
How much time do we have?
And what's that mean?
So what does it mean.
You have to say that.
We're going to do this.
Well why should I?
What's that got to do with you?
We'll do it your way.
They're not going to help us.
We need all the help we can get.
A lot of good that'll do.
You do know don't you.
But does this mean anything to you?
He could see me.
And you didn't say anything.
Well that's what you think isn't it?
Oh all that work.
This was really nice of you.
Why are you up?
How'd you get him to say yes?
I mean look at us.
How's that been?
Well what do you know.
What's up with that?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?
What'd it say?
When'd you get this?
That what you think?
I don't have to do what you say.
Well can you give him this for me?
This is just about money you know that.
We still have to go?
there's this thing out there.
Oh that's good.
Why are you here why are you doing this?
It doesn't have to be now.
To not do that.
Well I don't go out very much.
Yeah You know it?
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
And I don't have any money.
That's the first time you're right.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
I give I give.
She'll be back.
He's in here.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.
You want her right now?
I don't know what I've done.
I think that you know.
I am but I'm not.
How do we do this then?
I don't think I want that.
Did you tell her?
Where will the money go?
And What Now Then?
THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
I need this one.
I can take you to get money.
I have money to give you.
I couldn't tell you.
Take her from me!
There is still much to do.
But where did you get it?
I am with you!
I know the way.
I will need you all.
So they tell us.
Do I look all right?
What hope is there?
Is it something I have done?
Yes yes go on.
How did I get in?
And who are you?
What did you do then?
So where are you from?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
I need your help!
It wasn't like that!
No - that's not it!
Yeah and that's all I'm going to say.
You're not going to need that.
When I'm done.
When are you coming back?
That mean anything to you?
You do know something about him.
What's one way?
We'll get him one way or the other.
I am all right.
You look all right now.
It's the way you think.
Get right back here.
Why don't you come too?
That was nice of you to think of that.
It would be because I want you to.
I'll take you.
Think it'll do?
When do you need it?
You did very well.
I don't want to see you.
You know now don't you?
Can you tell me anything about him?
I don't want to do that
I don't think I'll tell you.
You tell me what you know about him.
Do you know something about that?
That's all we know about.
They don't want me up there.
If they thought about it they'd want you.
And they'll take you.
You could come up here.
I want to see you too.
Tell me what you're doing.
We have it good don't we?
He isn't really is he?
We're all well.
She got all right?
And I'll do it.
Why does it feel good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?!
I want to help you Will.
I don't have one right now.
There are things you don't have.
Why should I tell you?
Do you know how you did it Will?
Do you know how you did it'
You don't get it!
They don't want you back.
I'll go back.
But I like you!
What do you say??
I really want one.
What do they know?
Yeah I KNOW what I said!
He said he's coming back!
You all look the same to me.
But it's not here.
Too bad things had to work out like this.
There's something about him isn't there?
You don't do you?
What do you say to something like that?
Why you're here?
He's going to make it.
I mean who am I?
There is only what is.
How does she know?
I didn't think I would?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
You're going to need it.
Do you want to know what it is?
You have come because you know something.
Who's coming for me?
He is the One.
He is the One!
That's how these things go.
I'm not the One.
You think you're the One?
There's no way you're going back in!
It might have been.
How much like it?
Did you go to her?
Get this thing out of me!
And I know that's not where you want to be.
That's why I have to go.
What are they doing to him?
Know where he is?
Now you got it or not?
If I get there.
You know the way they are.
That's not going to help.
She's always got something.
No she isn't.
We'll be here.
Look take this for now.
Well he isn't.
I don't want to do that.
I think you should be you know that.
They know where to come when they need us.
I could help if you want.
Why don't you do it this time?
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.
That's more than we get to do.
This is your thing.
What do you do that for?
And I don't mean you and me.
I mean you and him.
I thought we had a good thing going here.
And so do you.
And what would that be?
Not good not bad you know what we got?
Why yes thank you.
And what do I get?
But who is he?
What is there to say?
I'm not going for it.
Is there any more to it?
No no not you.
But I didn't mean to do it!
I'd like to come too.
Yeah that's what he said.
You come for me?
Oh yes I do.
You look like you need one bad as me.
It's so very nice to see you again.
But you're not.
Yes that's why I said it.
What will we do?
Yes he's tired.
I said get out.
We're doing what we can for her.
But it doesn't look good.
I don't have any time to see you now.
How nice you look.
Get him in here.
Does she know where she's going?
Did you tell her who you are?
But I know who you are.
What way would you put it?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What's it like where I'm going?
When you go I go.
I didn't know her.
Could I say something?
And that's what we're doing.
I am this is it.
Why are you still down here?
That's why it's okay.
Then what will you say?
But give it to me again.
Oh yes I am.
That's for me.
What were you going to say?
Now could we go?
But we've got time.
Because I like you so much.
Now I've got to go.
I could be her.
You might be her.
What's the way?
You know why you're still here don't you?
I think I know her.
That's right I did didn't I?
When was I in here?
So why did you come here?
What you've just done?
How do you know about me?
Well that's me.
What are you here for?
What do you think I am?!
You don't know do you?
I had to tell him something!
I'll go see him.
How do I know he did that to you?
Tell me about her again.
When it's done I'll know!
How'd you know I was in here?
Don't go back in there.
Do not go back to her.
We've got to get him out of here.
You don't know him?
It's all I have.
That's who you were you don't know who you are.
Then that's it.
Tell them what you want.
It's like that.
All I want to know is the where and the when.
Just like I said.
And we never will.
What are you going to do with me?
Do I need it?
Where's she now?
We want it back.
And what do I do with him?
It's going down.
What's your take?
Then it don't work.
Do that for me.
I had to do it.
We don't know!
And people who are good at what they do?
But how I know if you any good?
Now you just look at this here!
How much time I got?
So what I'll do I'll just say now look you want me?
Now I'm here.
Well I hope you know what you're in for.
Okay right right okay.
That's who you need.
For money for what?
I should have thought.
No I mean yes please go.
Help me to be good.
What you got me up here for?
Right here why not?
Well not too I mean a little.
You'll need it.
Is he all right!
Right now we've got to get you out of here.
How much did you have?
What they give you?
Work work work that's all do
What are you doing down here?
He didn't do it!
How can he be?
We can do it!
Oh come on come on!
That's why we should do it now.
They know we're in here!
Do you think we did the right thing?
It's right this way.
Anything you can tell me might help.
Did I do good?
Oh don't me.
You have to tell me.
But the time is now.
And you're right.
Why what are you going to do?
I just thought it might be nice.
I'll go look.
I don't think I know!
And look what I've got for you.
See isn't this nice?
This isn't about money.
Well I hope you like it.
I know how that can be.
There I said it.
Oh like I could do that?
He might well be.
But not the way they say.
I'm doing this because I have to.
Why do you think she's really here?
Something's come up.
And you're going to have time.
Then don't say it.
Well that's good isn't?
See anything you like?
How do you that.
What've you got to say?
It's that time.
So first things first.
Oh well if that's how you feel about it.
Why would he do it?
Just do it now.
What did you think you were doing!
Just get me out of here.
I want you out of there.
Why did you have to tell me about this!
But it is what you'd like me to do.
That's because I'm on my back.
Well then what I am I doing here?
So where did I got right?
Just as if I'd like to.
Oh you don't have to do that.
About why she did it?
I don't think I can get her to do it.
What did you think of him?
You really shouldn't.
So what did he say?
Now how to get in there.
You still don't get it do you?
And what if I need it?
But why tell us?
Make him come to us.
We take the money.
Is this the only way?
You don't think we're going to make it.
We need help and we don't have time.
I'm going to get it for him.
Who is they who is they?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
They want you back in.
I'll give you the same.
And how might you know that?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Then what am I doing here?
I thought I'd take some now.
Take it all if you want.
I think I might just take that look.
That's what we do isn't it?
Why don't you take a look?
Look to your right then back to me.
No I'm going.
Oh you're not going.
I just want you to know.
I don't know where I've been and I don't know where I'm going.
I have no money!
I don't like him.
I couldn't think a what it was.
You haven't said anything.
I'll say no more.
I didn't see you here.
I got it done.
You've got to come.
When will you do it?
It don't work out for you.
And what did they say?
What am I going to tell him?
The only thing that's here is you.
It's the way we are.
And you're not now?
This is where we're going!
He didn't come!
And what do you know?
I know what I know.
What do you want to do now?
I will not come.
Oh yes oh yes you did!
Oh no I didn't!
She didn't like me.
Get all of me.
I like it well done.
I do what I want.
You don't have to help me.
No I want you to see this!
Yeah I'll be in.
I got things to do.
And she got well.
No more he's not.
Then you don't know.
Did he tell her?
But you like him?
You should think about this.
Okay I'll tell her.
He doesn't like you.
No that's really it.
I don't know where.
But now she's not.
Can I get another one of these?
It doesn't last.
I just got that.
We didn't know what to think.
She's got it.
What would he be doing down there?
Is who down there?
Is he down there?
Please please good people.
You said it again!
I cannot tell you.
What are you going to do.
I'll do you for that.
Well what's that then?
Well what are you then?
Isn't there anything you could do?
I don't know that!
Who's that then?
Didn't mean to?
Don't like her?
But I don't like her.
Oh I see Right.

What did he do to you?
Where should I take you?
That's what they said I was.
It will work out.
So what did they say?
You're still here?
It's just to the right.
We don't know about that money.
Do you know them?
Is it bad for you that I'm here?
That's about it.
It was just a thing.
Oh things aren't so bad.

How do we get in?
I come from time to time.
I don't know what he's doing here.
Well they can be.

Like it in here?
Yes I see it!
I would say yes.
I don't know who she is.
But it's here now.
I need to tell him.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
That's all I need to know.
So this is what you do?
There is no us.
I thought we had something here.
No one had to tell me.
I mean yes I'm not.
No it was more than that.
Well have a good time.
Do you want me to do it?
Look I know there's no going back for us.

I mean I just got here.
Okay we'll be there.
What if he doesn't like me?
Who said I was going?
This is no time to give up.
But how could he know?
Okay here's what I think.
I still hope that.
Well we're here.
You're coming with me?
I can just tell.
Come on it's not so bad.
If you've never been out with him how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
But we work it out.
How about the other one?
But I do want to.
And you didn't tell her?
That's why you're here?
Oh it's you.
That's not it at all.
I don't know I don't know!
You're in this too don't you see don't you see?
There's something I got to do.
I don't want you to do anything.
I know what you want me to do!
You've got to be one or the other.
I want you to go.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
Now what are you doing?
How about another one?
Want to go out and have one with me?
How do you like that one?
The things that go on.
That was nice of you.
How would you've done it?
Now you got me!
I get your thought.
Look what you're doing.
I think you could have.
She's a he.
Here you want him?
You want to know something?
How'd you get that.
He doesn't know much.
You don't work here no more.
I should hope not.
But don't give up.
You've got a right to be.
We have to get help.
Oh if there is only time!
Yes yes yes I know all that.
Then I will see them.
You two know them all.
Yeah that's him.
Tell me how do you do that?
Did he say about me?
He didn't want me to.
So what's that mean?
He's like Yeah?
Do we need him?
I'd like to know who she is.
She's coming with us.
But don't you do anything.
Is that what you would've done?
Oh is that right?
That's how you do it.
You think I will?
I want you to know something.
So she did help you?
You were going to see her?
Yeah but in a nice way.
That's not what you were about to say.
Well we got that out of the way.
No they're all right.
You think he might tell you where I am?
Think I could have them back?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Yeah she was good.
I don't think it would help much.
She said that to you?
Take her with you and put her in back.
You know who they are?
Some people are going out of here.
What's to think about?
They just do it.
It's nice down there.
Look at it that way.
I was never out there.
Can I do what?
That's what I'm here for tell you how.
Oh I'm here all right.
I'm very here.
I didn't have time.
He's about to.
That's right just me.
Tell me where the money's at.
He was that good?
How would I know.
I'm just doing what we've always done.
She said I was so much like you.
I said No I'm not.
I'm like I am because of you but I'm not you not as good as you.
Say what you think.
There's another one!
Now that's all I have.
Isn't that what you mean?
And that's why you've come.
If I don't make it you don't go.
You are okay aren't you?
But I need you to know.
And I will come back.
And not just there but here.
There's one thing I have to say.
How would you like that?
It's about time for another one.
What if I'm the only one?
It's all too much.
Wouldn't we all.
Oh it's not so bad.
I don't know how you do it.
I'll never give up.
It couldn't be me.
I think we should get out of here.
I know what you've been going through.
Does this mean you like me again?
Just take a look at it.
How'd you know about that?
You can always get to me.
I want to know what's going on.
And you know why?
And you were right.
As in is was and always will be.
You don't want them?
And she would Like to say something.
But that's what I like about her.
What's she doing with him?
And I don't want any of that.
The things that Last.
You should go but not with me.
I shouldn't have put you through that.
Who's going to think for us?

They're bad for you.
Okay what do you want?
Not to me they don't.
I'll go with you!
I've got to get out of here now.
They don't have any!
I know what people think of me.
I don't know how or why I'm here but you have to help me get back.
I know what you all think of me.
What do they do up there?
So where're we going?
You know he was.
You want me to help?
You want me to give up?
That's not what I said.
I have too much work to do.
I will be back.
You're not going to like this.
Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
You didn't look then the way you look now?
No we have to do it.
Who'd you get?
They want you out.
Why are we going to do that?
He never put it in.

You don't see.
Would if I were you.
Doesn't need to be.
How did you know we'd come here?
Right now if you like.
Just the same I want one.
You didn't think so then.
Where would it get you?
Where there's one there's another.
Well you know what they say.
I'd like to know why not.
We're here and it's now.
Yes I can do that.
I'm for that.
Who put them up?

- where that come from?
I'll make one for you.
And where you're going.
Can I do something for you?

Would I want to?
You could never tell about me.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Here put this on.
You wouldn't like it.
But not if you say so.
But that's what I'm doing.
Couldn't they think of that?
And where to go.
Do it all the time.
They'll look for you.
How bad is the other thing?
Why would they look for you?
From you I like it.
Anything I can do about it?
You don't know who he is?
He didn't like it.
You didn't have to tell him that.
I don't know how he got in.
He got in here how?
Do you think I don't?
I get tired of it.
I don't know you and you don't know me.
I was up there.
What will they do to you?
It doesn't mean much.
What does he see?
There isn't anything you can do.
Then there isn't much I can do is there?
You can see it.
Where's you get it?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
And here I am.
Got it on you?
You might want something from me.
Where did it all come from?
She didn't have to.
That's what I thought at first.
We don't need him.
We've done that.
But it doesn't
What do I get for it?
What would it look like?
How do I know you're you?
And there's something I don't want you to know.
Oh so I am.
The other one had the money in it.
I'm not one of them.
But not the only one.
How could I help it?
I think you'll do very well.
I didn't know you were back.
And some of that.
I'll have some of that.
I haven't really thought about it.
Yes if you like.
It was very good.
Are you up to something?
No need to thank me if you don't want to.
Tell me what you think of this first.
Yes if I see him I will.
Take a look at these.
I've got to be going.
I've got some in.
She'll like that.
You know what she's like.
So how is she?
I'll tell you another thing.
We've got the lot.
No he wasn't.
We'll see what we can do.
I want to look like you.
Come on you want to do it.
I'll take that as a yes.
I want you two to go work it.
I know where they're going.
I'm right this time.
Where you want me?
You've got to get out there.
I want to do what you do.
We take her with us.
They shouldn't have been here.
Mean anything to you?
That doesn't give you much time.
Do what you have to do.
But I do know.
There's no way you could know that.
You don't know anything about me.
You're very right.
What I have is a lot of money.
I do want to.
I know what I want now.
I'll take my money now please.
It's how I make money.
I'll think about it okay?
It wouldn't be like that.
I don't want anything more to do with you.
He's good at what he does.
I had some work to do.
And why do you say that?
Want to know something?
If I did I didn't mean to.
What do you want it to be?
I think we got him.
What's she do?
Come on you can tell me.
It's my money.
No one you know.
What's up where you going?
Here's some money.
Who did you think?
Why'd he want you?
We can do anything!
We work for it.
Will I like it?
And who is that?
I don't think we have anything for you here.
What is with you?
Do you want to know what he did?
I just might do that.
And what am I?
There will never be a need.
Why is that do you think?
And a good thing too.
I just want you to feel you're doing well.
Oh good my way.
Give her to me.
I have a little.
But you don't know where he is.
Yes some of the time.
Do you want me to go on with this?
So now where were we here?
But that's not the same thing.
It's very nice of you.
There we cannot help you.
Because I know something you don't know.
I could do that.
Oh have it your way.
You'd like to think that wouldn't you?
Don't help me.
There's no way out.
Take it when you can get it!
I want to see the money.
I think I'm coming out of it now.
I've got to get out of here.
You didn't go all the way.
What did it get me?
That isn't much.
They all come here.
Good what is it?
Do you need us?
How'd you know that you been up?
How'd we come out?
What did you tell the people?
She isn't still here is she?
Can see you do.
But not the same thing.
I have to know what!
That's what I want you to do something about!
Will you help us?
And I want her to tell us the same thing!
I think he would have.
He didn't come back here?
And you thought she'd come up here to me?
What should I know?
You know what I'd like?
I'm all for it!
This is the last time.
No not like me.
But I couldn't.
I'd like to.
How's it been going out there?
How are you going to do it?
He wasn't out when you were there.
He was out when I was there.
They thought she'd be coming to me.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
No I don't want money.
I don't know I tell you .
Take me down there.
I'd like to have a look.
Oh so you feel that way too .
You were to help me.
He isn't here.
- Give it to me!
That's the way I feel about it.
So that's the way it is?
Well I do say it.
What's nice about her?
And that is as it should be.
What do you think I am?
I'm for you!
I know all about that.
Does this mean anything to you?
Where do we go from there?
I know I'm right!
All right what about it?
How much money have you got?
I'll see it through.
I don't want anything more to do with it.
You weren't going with her?
Was that all she said?
Well what do you think I'm in this for?
All right I'll tell them.
You have done well and now I too have something for you.
Then you get it.
What did it want?
Why am I doing this?
I said she isn't here.
She isn't here.
Well I got to see her.
I got tired of them.
Well I like him.
But I don't know who they are.
I said I wouldn't.
No I'm all right.
Well now that is just too bad!
You like me don't you?
I like you a lot.
But who were they?
All right what do you know?
He's not coming back again.
Yeah he's still up there.
Now what were you doing?
Where can she go?
Right didn't she?
Yeah I know he was up here.
No it's another thing.
Yes we know her.
That's all I want to know.
I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Well I know more so.
I hadn't thought about it that much.
But it isn't as bad as all that.
Did you say something?
Well we know you were there.
I'm going to have one.
I'll just say one more thing.
That's what I got.
I think it's all you've got.
You think it's that good?
I don't know okay?
How you doing back there?
What do I do if I'm not that?
I can work this.
It's the way you say it like there's something more too it.
No but it should.
It doesn't say that.
I'm back here aren't I?
What will it be?
But that's all we got.
How'd we do?
No we are not going to do that.
We've got to give him more time.
There's still good in him.
I thought she was with you.
The same as always.
It'll take time.
That's all any of us can see.
I want you to take her.
You need all the help you can get.
Two more of them!
But I need your help.
Yes or no will do.
Do you want her to see you like this?
I know but it wasn't all bad was it?
I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Why do you think I should?
But wasn't it nice?
So please don't tell me to can it.
No don't do that.
But where will you go?
I've got something to say.
Like this - like how?
Do you want him to see you like this?
But it wasn't all bad was it?
I didn't make him for you
Was all I had to say
Oh no no no no.
They didn't like me.
Don't do that again!
I done it all.
When was they here?
I don't see it?
I'll do okay.
So where is it then?
That's what this is all about?
He had a will all right.
I just had to see you.
And he wouldn't.
Have you got the will?
Only time will tell.
I don't think they got the will.
Well no not any time.
Need you my help?
What is your will?
It is It is!
And so did I.
I am for you.
So where do you go from here?
Well I don't!
How do we know that?
But it wasn't my people who did it.
Not to me you know that.
I didn't say I was.
Do you have the money with you?
So what is it you want to know?
Tell me something first.
They might see it.
No you don't and you know it.
So I do it.
I know I don't need to say this to you but I need to say it to you.
I'm not here very much.
How could you have done that?
You would have done that?
It is at that.
He's going back.
It was at that.
What'd you say to him?
Can you get it?
I don't know what you're -
That's not US.
We can make still make it work.
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here right now!
We've got to go now then.
Well I mean it this time.
You said that last time!
He's not going to give them up to us.
Well doesn't he?
Well I'm not!
He would have done it to us right?
You know what they'd do.
That's how they all work it!
It's the right thing to do.
Well we didn't know that at the time.
What are we going to do!
All right we will.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
I'll be there for you.
Then we're going to tell him.
How are we going to do all this?
And I'd take it out on him.
If you said something he'd take it out on me.
You got me something?
I'm just tired is all.
Could it have been this?
We get a lot of people in here.
You said that I didn't.
What do you think about all this?
Don't you have to be here?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.
I'll go down with you.
So there was money there!
Anything I can help you with?
You'd do this to me!
You'd do this to me?
Well you might as well say it.
You can have it all.
I think I am.
So I want the money and I want it now.
We're out of here.
Don't you want it?
Well what do you know!
I didn't know you were coming.
That doesn't tell us much.
There was more than that.
How much is that?
So tell me what you know.
I'll take that one too.
Oh yes she's very nice.
I'm this way.
What does she know.
Why did you help me?
I know you got a thing for her.
We can help you.
I wouldn't do that!!
Get it out of here!
There's people up here!
There's people down there!
All I do is work.
It's all I have right now.
I should go back.
This is about more than all that isn't it?
You're not very good at this are you?
I'm okay you go.
But I'll help you.
Why don't you go get them?
This is a good thing.
Oh I think you like this very much.
What is it good for?
Yeah it's good.
I could not come.
Oh yeah but this is on the way.
Well don't do that.
It's the same thing!
I didn't say I didn't.
You have one of these?
So why you look do down?
You thing you can do that?
No way in the way!
I wouldn't want to be in the way.
How'd what go?
And I'm it.
How much they want?
How did I do this?!
You get him I get her.
I would like one of my people to help.
I still have work to do here.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
What is he up to now?
Where do you think she's going?
Is that what I did to you?
Did I just not see you?
You're coming here?
Then you've got it.
Okay you were right.
How would you like to get some?
Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
I just got one.
Is it okay that I'm here?
I'm okay with that.
There's the two of us.
Are you all right with this?
And it doesn't mean anything.
Then we'll come back for him.
I'm so tired of this.
I'll have the same.
Is that what you said to her?
How do I do it?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.
You're going to tell me about them?
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
This one's on me.
No you tell her.
I'm just not up for it.
Is it up is it down.
You go out in them.
You come back in them.
But it wasn't really.
You see what I mean.
And you know what I think?
I'll see you at work.
Is that all right with you?
What was that about up there?
He doesn't have one now.
You don't like the one he was now?
It's not for me.
This can go on for years.
That's not what I need your help for.
But how am I going to get there?
How much money do you have?
What do you mean okay?
It was all they had.
If I didn't go.
What if I couldn't get to you?
This is the one I like.
Are you going with her?
Why does she do this?
That is all I am doing.
Because I have you.
But I don't know any more.
So what is that?
We're going to be all right.
This is not how you do it.
I am not going to think about it.
Something you don't know.
So I can go.
I don't think I have to now.
I'd really like that.
He's good at it.
I tell you something.
Come in we'll work it out.
Will you be still?
And what will I get out of it?
But I can feel it coming.
It's a lot to them.
We're doing all right.
She's got to be there.
I should be there with them.
And then I'd think of you.
They say I am no good to you.
He'll have it good.
You'll never have it so good.
Then we'll work on these other things.
But you had to have it didn't you?
It isn't right.
You know I don't think that.
I want to do this for you.
Really I don't want to.
I could have done something.
You can still work.
: What are you up to?
Is that what you want me to do?
I'd do anything for you.
You aren't coming with me.
He doesn't have one.
Yeah that's what I mean.
So why'd you want to see me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
You got anything for me?
You want to do this some other time?
That's because he doesn't have one.
Now take the money.
That would be me.
Now that I can help you with.
We know what's going on.
And what does this have to do with me?
Again I thank you.
It's just not good.
I thought you were done.
Did you see what he did back there?
Not where I come from.
Just what I want to do.
It doesn't take this.
That's not what we're here for.
That's not where I am.
WE'RE COMING IN.
I don't like that one.
Don't do that again.
No no he's not.
How can you how can you say that?
I have people here.
Yeah I don't want it.
No no don't go in there.
Okay I got it.
I'm not going back there.
Don't say that it's not good for you.
That's right work it out.
I would have done anything for you.
No you don't know what it is.
You think you know what this money is?
Did you take that money?
I like him a lot.
It doesn't feel right to me.
You can say anything to me I hope you still know that.
I know this is a bad time.
Okay I give up.
And it's you.
Don't do this to me.
One more time would be nice.
Then don't do it.
No I don't I don't.
Okay how much time do you need?
How can I look at you and say this?
How do you know what I'm going to say?
No we don't have to say it.
Now they know you.
They're all about you.
I mean a lot of them think that they have to know right?
But I know that I don't know.
I don't really know where we are.
I mean like what are you?
Now I'm back and you know what I'm going to do now?
I'm going to have a good time.
Now you're back.
I don't have to like her just because you do.
You know what you'd like her.
You did but you didn't.
You know what I'm going to make?
Where's the money in this?
These people my people I want my people.
You want these people.
What do you want for him I'll give it to you.
Well you've been through it.
Yeah what's that?
What do I got for you?
What do you got for me?
You're on it.
I mean where have you been?
See what you can do.
That's not all right.
You did so much.
No no what what is it?
Never the good always the bad.
He'd be all right.
You think I don't know what you're doing?
I got to go I'll see you.
We're doing well?
What's he done that's so bad - take money?
We're here to make money all of us.
Would it do any good?
No it's me.
What if I said you?
Why aren't you there?
Where do you think he got it?
Where have you been'?
What can I do'?
Yeah how can we help?
I'm coming down.
That's not the way it's done.
It's what you want from me.
You're going to get it.
Can I come with her?
She's not here right now.
Do you work for her now?
No the other one.
So where is she?
I know you need my help.
And I know you know I need your help.
I'm always there.
And who would that be?
So is that why you're here?
I think you know about that.
She was there too.
They've got her!
I'm out back.
Do you want us to come with you?
Do you think he did it?
You do know something don't you?
I couldn't say no!
But now you're here.
We need to know where she is.
But you know who she was.
Here's how I see it.
Didn't like it at all.
Come on who is this?
I don't want them I want you!
How can I help you.
Why are you always at me?
She'll be there.
How'd you do?
We're on it.
You don't still think it was me?
It's not the same thing.
This is the way it is.
She's not coming back.
See it couldn't have been me.
But you're doing so well.
Come on yes you do.
They'd never make it in time.
What do you think I said?
I don't think you're so bad.
She's with me.
What is she doing here?
What were you doing out here?
I'll look for it.
And why would she do that?
What if she did it?
Can you see me right now?
So where are you?
Because they're all the same.
Like you had one.
This could be good.
No one can get you here.
Do they know who did it?
I don't know they just did.
I'm going to go.
Tell them thank you.
It's always been like this.
It will go on and on.
You didn't know.
It's really going to be something.
What I'm doing.
I can tell you this.
It wasn't one thing if that's what you mean.
Well you're not!
Just tell me what we've got.
Think about how we got here!
Well come with us then if it's okay.
We'll take a look at him.
It's not what you think it is.
How do you know all about this?
I want him bad.
It was my first one of these.
Does this make it with you?
Oh that's all.
Then you tell me what you think we're doing.
This is the one thing.
He had to get back out.
Come look at this!
Come on say it.
It's time for me to get going.
Do I look like it that much?
You mean like back then?
You didn't tell her!
Where do you want to have it?
Oh what have I done?
What is money to me like us?
You have the money?
I am here to help you.
I have not said all.
Yes but very well.
Is it going well?
Oh it's coming it's coming.
There's never any
Where will you get
Who is she this time?
No no we haven't the time.
Yes that's good.
You will not tell.
Oh when can we see another?
Oh but they can!
Come to look for it again.
Then I will go with you.
What will you have me do?
Oh do not go
I would not have thought it.
Does she say so?
One for her and one for me.
Where do you think you'll go?
Yeah but you were good you were really good.
Who's going to do it.
Who's going to do what?
So who's going to do it?
No she's not in.
I don't have time.
Don't know what?
No not any more.
I don't know them.
Take another look at these two.
That's because he is.
And you like it?
That's what I thought he said.
Why wouldn't I be?
And that's that.
Now you thought of that not me.
You think he'll come down for that?
He'll come down.
Because that's no good.
You know we're right.
No one said anything.
That's not him.
And now you tell me.
I thought we all were.
You see they don't really know me.
What are we to make of this?
Well that's what I said isn't it?
You were going to say something.
Yeah well that's what she said.
That's why you're here you see.
Yeah that's right that's it.
And that's about all I think.
Come on you should know.
I should hope so.
Is this what they always look like?
And that's not the same thing?
You know about it?
I mean that's what it's like.
Look again if you like.
That's okay too.
Think you could do anything for me?
No that's okay I'll do It now.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
I hope she's all right.
Then what do you think?
I'm the one they want.
Right that's right.
And you need money?
I've got to tell him where I am.
You did I know you did.
You did didn't you?
I just have to do one little thing.
You still see him?
Where do you want to do this?
Now I don't know what it is!
I hope you make it.
Yes yes I did.
that's not like you.
That's all you've got to say?
I just want to know that's all.
I've got to get her out of here.
That's all I'm doing.
What do you mean what is it?
No but I think they might.
Do you really mean that?
I am I am.
You'll do what I tell you.
What're you here for?
I don't know what to do with you.
Why why do you think that is?
What can I say!
I'm too tired for anything.
Isn't that bad for it?
I mean I know.
I make a lot of money for them.
I didn't say it she did.
All right who're you with?
Does she know about us?
Aren't you going to have one?
I would say so yes.
I'd really like to go.
I want you to like it here.
I'm just a little tired.
Do you feel bad?
I want you to have a good time.
Is there something bad here?
Do they know he tell you things?
How does he tell you things?
Yes I'd like you to.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
But how did you know that?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Yeah this is it.
Your money's no good here.
Now I'm back.
Get him out of here?
And you didn't see anything at all?
It's really nice up here isn't it?
Well something'll come.
How do you think they'll take to it?
Well that's very good time very good.
Oh I'll say.
Please take the money.
I want to make up.
What's the money for?
I know how you feel.
I think he's going to come for me.
You get that don't you?
Do I need one?
You know I just might!
Are you going in there?
How are you doing.
But do what I do.
I was with you.
I was good to you!
What did you think you were doing?
And the things you said.
Who do I thank?
What did who say?
But don't you get money?
Where did that come from?
You think I don't see?
Don't you know it!
But what do they want?
I have to do this.
Well then there's only one thing to do.
I want to get in?
You have to help me
Nice to know you.
What does she want now?
I think you were right.
I don't do that!
You should help them!
You were right the first time.
We've got to get you out of here '- now!
This isn't about me.
She doesn't want you back.
Okay here's what I want.
And get out of here.
We didn't tell you what?
But you didn't tell me!
You know so much.
We got the one we need!
She shouldn't have come back.
But how do we get there?
She just isn't here.
To all in need.
You cannot do this.
Will you do this for me?
What was she doing?
What good is this?
Should we go back?
All I need is this.
Say it out and out.
He did not do these things.
It was you there?
It is only me.
If you want me to go I will.
But what do you want?
Don't you see why?
How did you get them?
Now there's one more thing.
They right about you.
Yeah they's good all right.
What's got you down this way?
Don't look much like he could.
Wouldn't do any good if I did.
Well what did you want?
Tell me what it was like.
Don't tell me what to do.
Or I'll go get him.
Well it's on!
I'd like him to be here.
I'm not up for it.
Don't you know they would.
You shouldn't be that way.
Can you go there with us now?
You have to look out for me.
How'd you know to come out here?
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you.
I know you're good.
He'd be here right now.
Right then it was.
You know in a bad way.
I got a little money if he don't.
Would you go see her with me?
I thought they was.
Were they bad people?
He's mean to her.
He don't like me at all.
You don't need to know all of that.
He never did want to.
Didn't have too much.
I know he does.
I've always thought that.
Said I was well.
They know I'm well.
Do they know about you?
About why you were in here.
It'll take some time.
I don't know how to go about it.
I got you some.
It's nice out.
They say you're well?
They say I'm well now from it.
In a good way.
There's one more thing.
You shouldn't say that.
I'm just going to say it.
Why are you here now?
What if he does it again?
Well what do we do?
I know how that is.
Is this all of you?
I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'll have the same thing.
What about for you?
And what about for you?
It was a nice thing you did for her.
I never thought of it that way.
Any time you are.
But they're all the same.
I wouldn't think of it.
There's just one thing I want to know.
There's money in here.
And that's just what I don't have.
This is all I need.
You don't have to do anything.
I just need you to come with me.
You don't give up do you?
I'd like to help you out.
It wasn't all bad.
Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Just think of it.
Is that what you said?
Like what you're doing.
Don't look at me like that.
If you really want to know.
They come in they go out.
We'll see what we can work out.
I know what that is.
If it doesn't it doesn't.
I think I'll take them.
And how much are these?
I just want to know where he is.
Don't give me any of that.
I know he's been here.
What do you mean how'd I get in?
You want to work.
It was just a thought.
We're just here to help you.
Aren't you going to say anything?
So what's the time?
You got the time?
I really do know them.
You'll do it all right.
I'm not going to do it.
Here's what you're going to do.
It's my money now.
So how much does it come to?
I didn't think.
Yeah it might be.
You don't really want to know.
Where did you get that thing?
I have to work in here.
Is that what you do?
I wouldn't say no.
Yeah give him another one.
You want another one of these too?
What you want down?
And then something did.
It's not for the.
I couldn't say anything.
I can get you money.
With that last one.
Did you say more?
What's she going to do?
I'll take two.
On the way in.
Well why does it?
You want me to say that.
If you did it.
Didn't think about it at the time.
Can I say something here?
How does it get there?
Or could have been.
And that one too.
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.
He doesn't have it here any more.
All right - so what do we do now?
There you go with that we again.
How are we going to get out of here?
We did the right thing with it.
Who's got time for that?
I'll say there is!
You're not doing well.
Have I got things to tell you!
And where's he going to be?
Come on help me!
Now you've done it!
At a time like this?
But they know us.
I think they got me.
We didn't see anything - - did we?
Yeah - where were you?
Oh yes we do!
Oh please do come.
I know where to get some.
And that's one of them.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'm not at all well.
Why couldn't we do it?
Just the two of you?
Well it is to me.
Oh it's you!
No we couldn't!
Well here we are.
Yes they're here.
Did you have a nice time?
Oh it's not that.
Now where could they have put it?
Yes you're in the way.
She doesn't need one.
Wouldn't you know?
I mean - I'll see.
You don't know what they're like.
Why wouldn't I?
Oh I wouldn't say that.
I should get going.
I am so so bad!
I had to say something to get you here.
How do you know so much about so much?
And you do now?
Then there was that one other time.
And that was it.
You were so good to me.
I just never said yes.
How did you know that was me?
What do you say to that?
What is it you do again?
Is there any other way to take it?
What do that mean?
That's where we come from first?
Here it is right here.
I come from way back there.
You would do that wouldn't you?
I'll make him all right.
He'll tell you all about it.
I just got out here!
Is there something I can do to help you?
What we make it to?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?
Yeah but you know what?
Help me to help you!
I know what it is!
What do you mean?!
It's okay I am done for.
Yeah so what do we say?
What don't I get?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!
Now GET TO IT!!
This cannot be good.
They're not going to make it!
Well so we are.
Were you going to give it to them?
Oh he did did he?
What did you say to me?
And that's just too bad for all of you now isn't it?
What more do you want from us!
It's still not going to work!
Why don't you just go down there?
Why didn't they say?
Well it's a good thing that I did.
I can put up with it.
You have to get them out of there!
You have to come with us!
I'm not going with you.
Now you know how to get there right?
Look I know what I'm doing.
Is there anything I can help you with?
I want to get out of here!
I tell you something's not right here.
Well what would you know about it?
I need you to tell it something.
Yes I know all that.
Yeah but it didn't go so good.
You know what we got?
You couldn't do it.
But there is something I could do for you.
I got a right.
You got no right to be here!
What do you think I can do?
You see what you did?
You say who's there.
I say who's there and then you say who who.
Why would you help me?
I'm doing what I said I'd do.
Can I come with you?
How do you get this thing down?
What did you say to him?
And what do you have to do for him?
Do I want you?
So what about you?
How do you want it?
Do you see it?
We think it might.
No I wouldn't think so.
They didn't tell me anything.
I need you for this.
Get him out of there.
Thank you I can see that.
I have to tell you.
Where it's been.
But what does it do?
What do you make of this?
Don't tell me about me.
You're doing it.
Then where's it coming from?
You feel okay don't you?
Or was that you?
No he isn't.
What are they doing down here?
I did do that didn't I?
You don't think I put something in it do you?
It's what we are.
But why is he doing it?
You think it's me?
I'm coming back.
Why should I go?
You said something to him didn't you?
What could have done this?
They are or they aren't.
Where'd this come from?
Just in time for what?
In time for what?
Just in time too.
Now that I have it on.
You know how to work this thing?
Don't have to.
It'll do it for you.
She's not here?
What are you still doing here?
But they didn't.
Yeah I'll work on it too.
I'll work on it.
You don't think it does?
With what's out there?
He didn't say much at all.
I'm not going out there.
Then it could be very good.
You've done very well.
I'd know about it.
You'll have more need of it than I.
You don't need my help.
I'd never make it.
I thought I'd help.
I think she's going to be all right.
This isn't going to work.
But where do we go from here?
I just want to help.
I said we'd see.
I think we're going to need them.
I'm done for.
Well I don't know what to do now.
There is not much to tell.
Tell me where you've been.
I didn't see him !
Who wouldn't want that ?
How do you make him do that ?
You got it bad.
How do you feel about him now ?
Where are you going ?
I don't know you look like you've really been in it.
No I think something's up.
What do you think ?
You don't like it do you ?
Do you mean it ?
He couldn't say where.
I'll go for that.
Where'd it come from ?
I'm on it !
On one got it ?
Oh my what's that ?
Why did you go and do that ?
You know the one I mean.
You're not going back.
Oh is that how it is ?
Doesn't look like it to me.
We'll know if you don't.
What do you think you're doing ?
Who's that with you ?
We don't know it will do.
This is what I want.
See that it is.
There's no way to know.
Is there not more?'
I want him here.
Would you tell me about it?
What is it all about?
I do if you do.
Then I'll come back then.
This isn't a good time.
What are you doing down there?
That's really good.
If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
What what what are you doing here?
Well then what's he doing here?
Hope to tell you.
We know that you weren't.
We we have to give it.
Who are these from?
That isn't very nice.
In't that the thing?
We're out of money.
I didn't say anything to them.
You tell me what to do I'll do it.
We got to do something nice for him.
We don't have the money.
I don't got the money.
That's why I want it.
I don't know how I can.
Where we all go.
Now how can that be bad.
Where I'm going.
I got to see you.
About what you feel.
So here's what we do.
I could only help him.
He wouldn't know.
Who's that for?
What did you think that was about?
That's one time always is always.
Never say never you always say that.
Why would I say that?
What you're going to say.
I did what she said.
You don't need another one.
When you're there.
But you can still see him.
I have to get there.
So you're okay.
But you know what.
You say that like I don't know that.
You really need to.
But you're not done!
I wouldn't know what to say.
If it were you.
Just not to me.
You think I didn't get that?
What do I have that you don't?
Why didn't I?
And that's all it is.
And she will look back on this.
Doing the right thing.
You really didn't have to come you know.
Can I say one thing?
What it's all about.
See I know that.
How would you know anything?
I did it for her.
They don't want to be with you.
You mean for you.
This isn't going to work out.
I was in there in him.
Is only a hope.
Did it go like that?
Well they will be.
You could make us something?
But you're not good at this.
You don't need to.
What do you want to do for me?
Nice to have you here.
And then you do something about it.
But really you never know.
But when you're not.
What do you like to do?
We had to work.
I like these people.
It's all about who you know.
You know you have to.
You're tired of me.
Oh I know I know that.
What's not to know?
I'm going in there.
Well now you have.
But not any more.
So then what do you do now?
Anything I might know about?
Oh that's too bad.
Oh no not any more.
How'd you get it?
I'd like to be good at something.
So where'd you get in?
I mean I had to.
I'm going first.
We'll be out in no time.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
How much do they have?
Give that back to me.
I think that just might be it!
But how do I know?
You have a right to know.
And you'd like to see that?
I'll tell you what I do think.
But so do we.
Don't think I haven't.
Look he's there and you're here.
They're coming in now.
Shouldn't be bad.
Then this is it.
Where'd they get you?
Can I have some?
But I'll go back.
Oh no it's not.
Well what's it on?
It's really not about anything.
Yeah when's he coming?
Yeah we all want to see him.
So when's he coming?
No I know what you're going to say.
No I mean no one.
Well you know what we need?
Just go with him.

What's good about it?
Because I think it's good.
Why should you do that?

Do you want me to tell you?
This is for you and me.
It is to me.
Now what is it?
I need some money right now.
Because they want to see me me me!
They don't want that any more.
I want you to do this work.
Are you or aren't you?
And who have they got now?
How much will it be?
Will that do it?
Who said you could?
You wouldn't know.
Haven't got a thing.
I need it now.
What do you think I've been doing?
Only I'm not going to.
Did you know them?
What do you mean we?
She didn't take it from you did she?
I don't feel like it right now.
She can have it.
And you can see how you feel about me right?
What's not there now.
What wouldn't last?
She said it wouldn't last.
But I have to go back.
What do you feel about me?
When can I see you again ?
Can you get us out?
That one was for you.
I always get what I want.
Oh no not you again.
I've got things to do.
But I don't know what it is.
I mean you were there.
She's out to get you.
Yes I see it.
Give him to me.
Not doing this for you.
Didn't say I could.
You're going to take me back?
You could do anything.
Only have the one what would I do?
A thing like that.
There is a way.
You look at them?
But what about other people?
What did you tell me?
That's why I put this one up.
What would I do when I got there?
Do you think I could do it?
I can never get a way from it.
Do you know what you are?
Look at this here!
what will I do?
What will it get me?
What will it do?
Yes but they don't really need them.
Yeah yeah I can do it.
No we're just going down.
How you doing down there?
Why do I have to do this?
I just hope you know what you're doing.
I really don't know how to thank you.
Well not so little really.
No I don't think I would.
You wouldn't like that.
Okay what is it?
I'll do more than tell you.
I thought you'd never get here.
Come on will you?
This time we got it right!
There isn't any more.
I've got to!
I could have it all!
That's what I want to know!
I just know me.
you didn't know .
But what can you do?
There's no way now .
I have to go back .
And I say I'm right.
And you weren't.
Oh was he here?
Not when you've got so much going for you.
Well you never will again!
Does she know about it?
She's in it!
Give me another one.
I've never had one.
No me me me.
But you had more than that and I know it.
Can I never have what you had?
Yes but it's not all I feel.
But him is you.
It's in there!
Now if you could .
And when you do .
I will come to you.
To all of us.
And what he did .
That's just it!
I really don't think .
You know him so well.
You haven't been at work .
How did you know .
And what do we get out of it?
What's he going to say?
But he's never there.
you want to tell him how you feel .
he'll like me.
And I like him that way.
Didn't you see it?
Just put it on.
What I need this for?
it's the way it always is .
Just what are you up to?
One of them should've been you.
And about time too!
And what does he think about?
I know you know.
You're not the only one.
I mean the other one!
We just take it?
What does it say here?
It's you who don't see.
This will get him.
That's what I get!
Why does it all mean so much to you?
What do you make of that thing?
He will look like one of them.
Can you really see through anything?
You've got me?
Who's got you??
But how could you know that - Oh well.
I'll tell her that.
That's where I'm going.
But she's well?
And what does he do again?
Because that's what I'm about to do.
You know how much we need the money.
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't know why it should.
Because I have to.
That's what he said is it?
I mean the way they look.
Did he say what about?
So he was mean?
You have to think of it that way.
What do they do?
That's how it is.
You always think you know what I'm going to say don't you?
So you're just the thing we need.
Who did they get for that?
That's why he don't work no more.
And that's all.
There wasn't time?
And there wasn't time.
That's okay with you?
He couldn't look at me.
How will he do that?
Not for you not for any of us.
You don't like it do you.
He's here isn't he?
Well what have I got?
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Can I come out?
I thought he would.
- He's got them on him.
- that's what I mean!
What would you think of me if -
I've been up to here.
If you want me to -
No more you don't!
I am just going -
Not what you're doing now.
I'm out of it.
You don't need us.
We're going all the way!
I didn't want to know.
And that's another thing.
You have to do what I say?
I need you so much.
And what it that?
What's going on with you?
Well just like me.
I would like to go now please.
What's not right?
You have that too?
Think you can get me any of that?
I'll tell you then.
Okay so what is it?
I want him out the way.
Yes I know who he is.
Take your time with this now.
I need to work.
You know of anything like that?
One of my people?
And I see what you mean.
I don't think I like this.
And I don't want to know where you got it.
Isn't that it?
That's where we're going.
About where you're from.
It's my first.
It's just him and me.
Do you feel up to it?
He's got her.
You want to know what it is?
What it's all about?
I put it down.
What did you really see?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Then what good are you?
If there was one.
Where'd you all go?
How do you know that's the way?
Do you know what to do?
What's with him?
No it doesn't!
You're one of them.
You think I know?
What have they been doing to you?
Tell me where we're going.
Do it for YOU.
I thought you'd like this.
I don't need anything from you.
I don't want money.
You can get me in.
That's what I'm good at.
You'll be out of here in no time.
No I mean what is it FOR?
Isn't this what you like?
Didn't I give you two?
You're not like him at all.
I'm just like him.
Not much I think.
Look where is he?
I know who she is.
It's what they do.
You know you can.
Not that you'll need it.
I've never been here.
I think he's here.
You get your money.
Don't get in the way please.
You will come here now.
What I do with this is up to me.
You'll never see it again.
This is where we're going?
How'd I know it was for you?
How could you do this to people?
Don't know how she got it.
Why would that be?
They're all in here.
We have to help them!
I don't think I want any.
Well it wasn't me.
Why didn't he tell us?
This is really you?
Am I a thing?
Then what good is he?
He's been with me for years.
Now I like it.
I just do it.
Well can we make it one more.
What did you tell them.
They don't work like that.
One thing I need.
First in first out that's me.
That was one of them?
Well there you are.
That's not who I am now.
Know what that is?
She didn't know what to say.
I did my time okay?
What more is there.
Who done it then?
Didn't get it.
Never thought of that.
Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
Last time might as well've been the first.
What about just now?
And how did you get it?
I don't know about what.
What'd you want me to do.
Is that what this is about.
Well not to you.
When did you get in?
Don't think she wasn't.
How could I be.
Not with that look.
What was that then?
No why did you come here?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.
That's good that.
I had to didn't I.
And I said so what.
Wouldn't that be good?
Where is he then?
I know her all right.
So why would he want to see you.
Why did you do it!
Will you come in?
You know what you are?
He didn't say that.
I know you haven't.
I have to do it.
I thought that was very good.
No I don't really.
How'd she do?
You know who I am!
I can get it yeah.
There's money in it.
I don't know what I can do.
I only work here!
Well you know what that would do to me.
You don't have to tell me anything.
But I don't know how much to tell them.
You don't have to tell them anything.
I did do that.
I know some of it.
What if I could get the money?
I don't know who!
I don't know I wasn't there you'll have to tell us .
On your way there?
On your was back?
I was with her.
You should be there.
She didn't do it.
Might like that here.
Just like you and me.
You want to see them?
I don't want to think about that.
Help is on the way.
I've been down there.
We haven't got time.
I think I should come with you.
What's that doing here?
It's still back there!
You have to come!
Come back and get me.
We have to help.
I mean what if?
Could we see them please?
No one's been down there in years.
But I think it's bad.
I don't want to go this way.
They've got something.
It couldn't see us.
What is it doing?
How did it get here?
Where did you see it?
It's okay I'm all right.
But you wouldn't want to do that.
What's to see?
Then who am I?
You think she'd go through with it?
Well what do you want to do?
It's not up to me.
You were right about one thing.
I'm not in on it because there is no it.
That's why we've got to get out of here.
Can you come with me?
See here this is us.
Because I never have.
So why do you want to go?
I do don't I?
Well thank you for your help.
I think it does.
Well look at that.
Then what is he?
You think you can do this don't you?
Isn't that something?
They have so much they want to tell.
I have done this you know.
There's still a lot to do.
They think you did it.
What good have we done him.
Why should he help me like that?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
How did you know I would be here?
Are you going too?
Need we go through it all again?
I don't know anything any more.
You can help us.
How will I know you?
Well there's not much time.
When did you see him last?
I'll look it up for you.
They wouldn't know me.
You wouldn't do anything.
It was just about here.
What would you like.
I can tell you very little.
She said you were up to no good.
You know that no one could get to.
So from there to there?
Here take a look.
How come you don't know it?
What do you like it here?
No I think you shouldn't.
Because He's not like anything.
It would take years.
Do you know it like that?
I'm with one right now.
There's something I want to do here first.
Isn't that what we want?
Yeah and what are you?
I don't think you know what you are.
Because I know who they are.
How would I know him?
So what's this about?
Is this about me?
But I wasn't.
There was more than one?
How have things been going?
So that's what?
Didn't you get anything?
You look right through him.
It's all you want.
What do you think you should have done?
Will you do that for us?
We think you'd be good at it.
Very much I think.
And just where are you from?
What was he like when he was little?
What are you going to get?
And where did you say you were from?
I was right about what?
Well that's very nice of you.
Thank you thank you very much!
I give you this.
He doesn't like us.
You don't have that one do you?
Well what are they?
It's me again.
Do you know how it is?
I don't know I just feel it.
You look it too.
I'll go see how he's doing.
Why is he doing this?
Will you help me?
I did what I had to do.
Please you have to help me.
Oh she said that did she?
I just thought that you might want to know.
What's it do?
Oh did I tell you.
You were right it is good.
So how was I?
I don't know -
You could do anything in that time.
What do you want to see him for?
They don't say it to me.
Don't look at it!
What are you doing that for?
I look for them with money.
But they didn't get him.
Then we will be just like other people.
What would he do?
You know a lot.
I'll take you about.
Got some nice things.
He as good as said so
All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Now look what you've done.
Then I'll be just like him.
You're too good to me.
When will they be back?
Will you please come with me?
Think what you like.
I might come back I might not.
I know where to look.
You want money right?
Got anything to say?
Come on I need you.
Do you know where it is?
What if it is?
Is my money in there?
You can do anything you like.
But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
How do you know me?
Can I get up now?
Can I go on now?
But it is what I want.
If you really want to help me there's one thing you can do.
And why haven't I done anything?
Who do they think I am?
This I can do.
And why was that?
And when was that?
I have the right to do anything I like.
But where are you going to be?
I didn't mean it!
What did it tell you?
I would like to have it back.
So how would you put it?
Get them out of here!
But how could I do that?
I can see her if I want to.
That's not a lot.
And it's not the first one!
This is no good!
Why are you doing this to me??
No I do not think so.
I want to see that.
I am that I am.
I want to be at one with Him now.
And what does he say to you?
What do they think they're doing?
Where will we get them?
Where do you want me to go?
I've no money.
Oh you need me now yes now you need me!
You're out aren't you?
You know what we do?
Yes but what good did it do?
Who'd have thought?
should never have come out.
Can you do something for him?
But I want to help I want to.
If they're still there.
I want to get out of here.
No I don't think so?
I've got another one.
What's your work?
That is good yes.
Yes I thought that.
I don't have money.
What are you about?
They want more money.
What's he say?
What did she tell him?
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
He's got all the money.
We can do anything we want now.
I don't need anything more than I got.
Did he say he wouldn't?
Then you'll do it?
You know anything about him?
But what about all these other people?
She don't work here no more.
All of it bad.
You want your money back?
That's my money.
Get on with it then.
We haven't got much time.
How does he do it?
Don't think I know him.
I think he will.
He'll never do it.
Wouldn't that be too bad.
Don't know a thing.
I thought you might know.
And if it isn't?
That is if it's all right with you.
It's the same one.
I'll tell them.
I didn't say I would.
But we've got to have money.
You couldn't go to her.
I've got to see him.
Oh here she is.
Did he tell you where he was going?
That you did it?
I'd like to see him.
When is it going to be?
If you think it'll be all right.
You see how much we have to say.
You weren't there!
Could this be him?
Well what'd you think?
Oh he's all right.
We know all about him.
I thought it might be.
Anything you want to know?
Who's is it?
What'd he think it was to you?
What's that to you?
What's he want of you?
I wasn't in.
Well we'll be going.
Oh there are two more to come.
I'll do anything!
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Just what I said I'd do.
I said all right!
I'll get some.
I never had it.
I haven't got it!
What if I did take them?
What did you do with them?
She'll get it from you.
But what if you need more money?
You might do that.
That's just why I'm going.
Did you get my money?
Right - I'll get that.
You know as much about it as I do.
Does she have to be up to something?
But then you'd do anything for money.
I did see him!
He didn't say very much.
Is he here too?
But I'm not in this.
He'd like to see you.
She was always on the up and up with me.
All right - you didn't.
I hope you're well.
Tell me do you think one of them did it?
Oh they'll come.
Want to see me take him?
I'm going to tell her.
Well don't they?
Don't say it that way.
Not with all your money!
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Where's it from?
Did I give it to you?
Well didn't you?
They think I did it!
There's one coming.
What are you going to give me?
I hope I don't like it.
I'd like to see you work.
She didn't tell me a thing.
I haven't the time.
Wouldn't you like to take it?
You're not going to have anything on me.
Come on out now.
Get your things and get out!
You don't know he isn't.
Then get up and do something about it.
You just go when I say go.
But if we do it we do it right.
No please not again.
Not up to us.
Think we're going to do it?
I wouldn't know where to go.
Don't make so much out of it.
Yeah but why me?
You shouldn't think about things like that.
It's always been like that.
We go this way.
What do you make of them?
I just said I would.
I just want to look at it.
You know what I'm going to do?
Then we go this way.
Really I'm not.
I don't want it this way.
We got to go back.
It should or it will?
Yeah that'll work.
We're not going to do anything.
Where'd it go?
That's going to do it right?
How's this going to work?
We can see them they can see us.
We've got to do something.
It's all all right.
But we all got to be in for this.
There might be something in there.
See how I mean?
So we'll take him with us.
Yeah we're down.
Think we can make it?
Is there anything you do know?
You have to go with us.
We can make it.
We have to go back.
Yeah well we're not.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Like I said; so?
Now you need me.
I thought it would be good to know.
I'll never make it the way I am now.
Don't take anything.
You know I don't feel well.
You can work with us.
You're not like them.
I thought you were through with it!
Would you like something?
You don't know that!
She's not there
I've got to get to her.
What am I to her or she to me?
But I didn't.
You know I didn't.
Here do what I tell you.
So what were they doing here?
But she could be.
Then why tell me?
I want to work this.
What was it this time?
So what'll you do?
It's about this.
I don't want to see you at all!
Well why don't you say something?
You have to get out of here!
Well we'll have to take what's here.
And what of it?
They're all right aren't they?
I would like to.
And you know who did it?
Then why do you want to go?
So you think you can get me?
I don't like you at all!
You think that's too much?
That's what you need!
Yes that's it!
Where does he come from?
I don't want your money!
Don't you know where it is?
Didn't you take it with you?
Then why did you do it?
Don't you mean work me?
How it's going?
One way or another.
Good of you to come.
Never did like it much.
I say we go back.
Don't you give up.
You have to go for help.
He couldn't have.
Only you can do that.
You're not one of them.
I think I would.
I want to thank you for what you did.
You think she was really there?
Can you give us something go on here.
Would you like anything?
There that's nice.
See you again I hope.
What do you know about them?
How well do you know her?
Anything I can do?
I'll say she is!
I'd like to be.
Want to take it back?
I'll take one.
I should say not.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
What's he got that I haven't got?
I know he is.
Come and get him.
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Just did what you had to.
We go all on one One on all.
Yeah you look it.
Yes but there's just something About him.
So what does he want?
Don't look To me.
All right what's it to be?
You feel bad about this?
I know me too.
What should we do About it?
Then why are you with him?
But That's what I want.
Just doesn't that's all.

They got Me good.
Doesn't Mean anything.
No Come on really do you?
Well how do we look?
Here they are again.
Not If there's money in it.
Look at the time!
Get them out of here.
Didn't I mean anything to you?
What is it this time?
We do what we can.
Does this do anything?
And when might that be?
Why don't we just take these -
If I were you -
And another for you?
What do you make of all this?
I got here first.
How is it now?
It's doing it again.
Oh here we go with that.
We got the same thing.
We will take her.
When are you going to do something to help him?
We see him from time to time.
You always got something to say.
We are going to have a good time.
What did you put on it?
I will see to them.
It would be nice.
I'm just too tired to go on.
How is he doing?
He will be all right.
Well I don't want to put you out.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Now what did I tell you?
Come on this way!
Don't you get it?!
How are you doing that?
No one will see us there.
All right then I will.
Give her back now!
Now we'll never know what it is!
He's with me!
How about we DON'T?
Who is it this time?
There aren't any more!
Who's up there with you?
I know you're tired!
Why does he need money?
Was he with you?
Something only you can help me with.
You want to know what's going on.
Because it isn't.
I mean what would you have done if you had been us?
Is this bad for him?
Are you going to?
Oh yes I can.
I wasn't doing anything.
I get A's.
If she didn't she should have.
I'll put this in the back.
There's always a way.
You don't like it here?
Take this back with you.
I don't think you're going to do that.
No but a lot of other people.
You should come out with us.
What's he doing up here?
You should feel good about this.
He'll do what I say.
What is it you want me to do?
It could mean that yes.
I mean how would we know?
What does that tell you?
What do you look for?
Just tell me where she is.
I want your money I'll take your money.
You want to help?
Can you tell me anything?
Yes I hope so as well.
I don't know what to tell people any more.
You were in my way.
Too right it is.
So what's he like?
I put up two.
Well it isn't.
There's no need.
Would not say no would not say no.
But you don't have the money?
You can look it up.
And see when I get out of here.
I'm going to get it right this time.
Where did she come up with that?
There are more of us than you know.
I got him back.
We're down here.
If you think it would help.
It isn't that.
Because it's there.
This is who they are.
You're back with us.
I hope you don't think it's me.
Right on the money!
That all you can say?
So do as I tell you.
Oh I know all that.
No I don't think you
Not us I hope.
I mean in here.
It'll come back to you.
You think we can make it there?
He was going to tell me how to
He doesn't know anything about me.
And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Do we know where she is?
I thought this look like your work.
You know about that?
You tell on me I tell on you.
So it was your first time.
But you didn't.
When I see something I want I have to have it.
What did he give you?
Then where did I get this?
It's me you want right?
I can do it!
What did you need?
Did is work out okay?
It's not okay.
And you've got one.
What is it you need me to do?
See you're very good.
It is what I want.
Was it him or you?
You don't know him -
And again and again and again.
Did I do something?
She didn't take too much.
What would make you think that?
This is the first one.
So that was no help.
Where are you from.
And here we are.
Tell him to look through it.
Now what would you do.
He like it too.
You'd really do that?
No I don't really mean it.
Do you really mean it?
I don't think I'll need it.
I don't know what do you want me to say?
Do you know what that's like?
But I did it.
I'll tell you when I see you.
Yeah he's good.
No really where does it come from?
Like look at her.
I can see what you mean.
I got some money I can give you -
You're here because you want me to help you in some way.
That's what you do isn't it?
I'm really not very -
I can but I don't.
They didn't tell me.
You think he'll help me out?
Where'd he come from?
That was very good.
I mean that's me.
- Because it's good!
You haven't done anything.
I didn't mean -
What are you going to do with us?
I think you were here too.
That's what they were up to!
I want to be here.
How did it get there?
What does this mean to you?
I need help all right.
I've got one now.
No I think it was always you.
And I was in it?
She didn't know anything.
I need to go.
I need to go now.
You do know me.
You want me to don't you?
But that's not why you're here.
It's all right there.
What are we for then?
What'd they give you?
You're the one!
Don't tell me anything.
You want me to go in with you?
You want to go in?
Same back at you.
You just don't know where or when or how.
We all got through it all right.
Yeah I want something.
You got two years on me.
What's that make me?
I'll give you the money!
That's where I have to go.
I didn't tell you to do it!
You think bad and bad is what you get.
Now that's too bad.
What time is it now?
What did I just tell you?
He's up at the Look Out.
You want it or don't you?
Now look at what you done!
That wasn't so bad.
Just put it in there.
Now how much did you get?
Same thing you want.
You never said anything.
But I want to say with you
He had no right to take it.
He was going to take the money.
Get it and put the money in it.
We're going all the way.
I know it's here!
It's got to be here.
About me I mean?
There's only one way to do that.
Is it so bad?
I mean all the time.
Just something he said.
He's got money.
He doesn't give it to us.
I know where we could get the money.
I just want to get out of here.
I mean I would .
do things for him.
That's about the only way.
Now what should we do?
How do they look.
The same thing you do.
A little of this a little of that.
Where you coming from?
It's very nice of you to help me.
No I've got it.
That's right on my way.
How do you think I got in here?
But I need the money.
I've got to have the money.
Yeah well me too.
You think that's a lot of money?
Had you done it.
I know all right.
The time wasn't right.
And tell her what?
I don't have to do this you know.
If it doesn't then it's no good.
I don't like you and I don't like what you are.
How much could you get?
Just to get out of here?
And what does that make you?
Now what can I do for you?
I do all right.
Like you don't know.
She does at that.
Is this what it's all about?
But if you're not I think I'll be on my way.
I said come on!
What I want is for .
You never have to see me again.
Now what's this?
Would you please tell him?
I was on my way to you it's just .
How much did you get?
We don't have any money.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
He is at that.
It's all the same to me.
Well he's right.
But I need the the money.
Tell her you had to see her.
I'll get you your money.
Can you make it back up?
But we all need that too.
It doesn't work with me.
Please I really want to be with you.
If we can make that.
I don't know why!
Don't you really want to know?
Don't you want to know that?
Where should we go?
I don't know about that?
I'm not coming back.
The money's right here!
I'm doing this for you.
I'll get you out of here.
She was like me.
Is that why you're with him?
How do you know he's still not here?
How do they look?
What'd you say to me!
Well it's about time.
Like you did me.
I had to put him down.
I think that was the first time.
No that's it.
You put too much.
I'm going to work out.
I have to do some things.
I'm going to go in.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
Well go get it then.
Do you want it or not?
This was the last time.
For what they done?
That's all they get?
I didn't think they'd really do it.
How do you like her?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't.
You could have it.
Yeah he's in there.
You still think he's in there?
You didn't get him?
He don't go I don't.
Well I come back didn't I?
The two of us could do it.
What was the money for?
This is not right.
So who did it?
You don't think I know you're on the take.
Just do what I tell you.
Something - I don't know.
Not if we do it my way.
They'll do anything.
I said no way.
How are they going to do it?
Don't tell me you don't need this.
They - They don't know me.
You have to come.
We know you can get to us and now you know we can get to you.
We all know what this is.
What do I tell him'
I don't think he does.
He doesn't know what you want to know.
Not good like you.
Then why didn't you help him?
you didn't know who it was.
I thought we could make it.
Oh but it's not.
I know he was good.
You going my way?
He had no right to say that.
You didn't know her.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
There are things you didn't tell me.
How can I see her to know her?
Not what you think.
And you like it.
But she doesn't know.
She doesn't know what she did.
No she's all right.
She's still here.
Didn't he give you anything?
Just as I've done.
I'm going to.
No I don't want to go.
For the last time.
Then I'll do it.
I don't like it!
I don't want anything!
Is that what I'm here for?
No it's not right.
There's a good one.
And don't look at me.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Oh Well thank very much.
Then will you for me?
I want to know who you are.
Well it's not going to work.
I've never been there!
Can you tell me?
There is so little I know.
And I have to know.
Tell me what it is.
Where do you go?
If I've been there?
Do you know where you're going?
That's what I was going to do.
I hope we will too.
Will you tell me something?
There that's done.
No I wouldn't like that.
And you don't know me!
It's out there now.
You like it too.
Where had you been?
Would you please go and look?
Is there something I can do for you?
What I've been doing?
All right come on.
Do you know him well?
I look up I look down.
You'd think I'd would.
Well you've got it.
More than you think.
Well that's what I said.
I said how's it going?
They're not on to us.
They're on to us.
No first of all.
It will not work.
They're on me.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing.
It's not a good thing.
We did what had to be done.
We have to get going.
So that's what we're doing.
So you get her out of here.
We can do this.
We can get her out of here.
Why didn't we help her?
What do you think you are doing?
You don't know what you're doing.
Have you thought about what I said?
So they really know that I need them just as much.
She's all your's.
Do you see where I'm going here?
I know you'll be.
Do you have something to tell me?
Give me two more.
He just had two.
Where do you look?
Do you get me?
And I want my money.
You want to know what you are doing here?!
What you just said.
I said what have we done?
Well I didn't mean it.
What did you tell her?
I think it's going to be okay.
You go down there.
It's not that I don't like him.
Are we going to do this again?
Don't you put this on me.
What do you mean you think so?
This is my doing.
I am all that.
What will that be?
We don't think so.
You see where I am here?
I should like you to do something for me.
That's why I didn't say anything.
Only because you want it.
You see how much you like her?
Shouldn't I be?
I'm not like him am I?
He was very good.
Is she coming back?
Are they going to work here too?
How much do you want for him?
It's for people!
But why does he want to see me?
No I don't want to.
Why would they be going there?
She didn't have to but she did.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Not from in here.
Think you can do it?
How does he know who I am?
Do I get to see it or not?
Help me get out of here.
It was me what?
It was you wasn't it?
And what I'm not.
Why are you going to do this?
He's come back!!
You know I am.
I know who would know.
I never really thought I was going to make it.
Don't you want me to see it?
Well what do you want to do about it?
And what do we do now?
That's not bad at all.
Tell tell tell me again.
Could if we had to.
No I don't think you can do that.
Want to thank you.
I've come to feel It's my thing.
Why would they want that?
What do we have that they want?
They got to have something that we want.
Yeah good good good good good.
Yeah but he didn't see me.
It could've been my money.
You want to see this or what?
I'll still be here.
And I was right.
They're all on.
Didn't he tell you?
What do you want to do?!
I want him to look at it.
It's not what I do.
The last to know?
Like these how'd you get these?
You really mean that?
Why are you doing this!
The two of us.
So what do you see in this?
I want you to go back to him.
Now tell me why would I want to do that?
I'll take it to my people.
Can I get you some help?
Who's is all this?
We've got to get back.
Then why do you still like her?
I mean you know it's bad for you
Can we please not do that?
I'll come back all the time.
It could have been bad.
You think that'll help?
How do you know it's a she?
Then why did you?
It's good to see you two doing so well.
And then you weren't there.
How can you help me?
Well she wouldn't.
What if he was?
Did he say that?
I need to do something now.
I got there first.
This is not something that I can do right now.
It wasn't anything.
Know what I think?
She's doing this!
She's out there isn't she?
I don't know but I am.
How did she know where it was?
What did you think I would do?
I don't want to but I do.
And why is she here?
She could be out.
Where is she then?
That's just mean.
You know what that does to me.
We were never like this.
Of him I think.
It's just us now.
Some time for us.
It's okay if you're not.
When's she out of here?
No they don't think that way.
He's not to know.
I don't like -
You could work again!
Yes - and you have.
And she doesn't have.
I'm NOT like you!
that is what we are.
She didn't feel them
I don't want the -
There are things I have to know!
I'm coming down there!!
A very tired one.
Do what you can.
They want to come back.
I don't know what you are!!
There was no thought.
That is not what I am.
Do not tell me that!
What I can give you.
And you will feel that.
There are things you will not tell him.
You are here for me now.
I know something's in there - and so do you.
And so are you.
I should have been here.
He said he'd see you.
Yes - I have had it for years.
No - not all the time - I mean
It's what you would do to me
Please - it would help me
- I said You know what I want.
- But she didn't.
I really don't know what to say
I want you out now
I thought it was you - how are you?
I get it now.
I mean yeah I do.
You really don't get it do you?
So you'll think about it?
So here we are.
But we never want you to want for anything.
But we did want you.
You can have it then.
But you never do.
What do you think of her?
I know you can take it.
I'm doing all right?
Why look who's here.
She still work there?
They were in me.
You'll give this up?
What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
I don't want to do it again.
I thought of that.
You know what you get?
You know that as well as I do.
He did say something.
Did he come in with you?
No one will see it but us.
Where's this coming from?
And what do they say?
I said he did.
Did he or didn't he?
She's not that way.
There was no way.
I'll have to look for it.
Now tell me I'm right.
I know you think you are but you're not.
Now will you tell me what this is about?
You mean this thing?
It is and I don't.
He'll like it.
Never got it back.
What way is that?
What was all that back there?
Now what was that?
Didn't mean that.
I'll see it through!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Oh I would hope not.
Yes in a way.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
About who you are and all that?
That's who it was!
What do they want with me?
When are they coming?
Then come with us.
What did you do this time?
Now you know where you're going?
Now put her back.
But I need help!
Then you get us out of here.
Well what did she say?
Did she say anything?
You don't need any help.
I thought you had her!
But what's this got to do with it?
How much more do I have to do of this?
What do I need for that?
I'm not going in there.
How are we going to get out there?
This is not going well.
Didn't say why.
Where'd you think?
You just do as I say.
Who'd you see?
But they do now.
That's all I can give you.
So one of them got to him.
Oh he's good.
That's what I know and that's what I do!
There is always a way!
When will you be going?
I know what he said.
But I've got to go.
And you're the only one who can do anything.
But not a good tired.
Don't come in.
You know where he is.
You just wouldn't.
Yes thank you very much.
I have to help him!
All right where is he?
She say where he is?
Get back in there.
You have no right here!
Is this where we're going?
Oh I hope we got them in time.
Oh come on - come on!
Give him back to me!
Oh will you help me?
But you couldn't have been could you?
What's she doing now?
Do you know any?
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh there's one on me!
Oh but he will!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh are you all right?
We don't want you to go.
They're coming back!
But I couldn't have could I?
What have you done with them?
So it was you was it?
Where do we go now?
We've got to get her out.
And where did they take her?
Oh did - did you see that?
They have one thing that you haven't got!
But I still want one.
Who did you get it from?
I have to go to work.
Just you me and my people.
Now get me out!
Why are you like this?
I want to know all about you.
I see it all now.
I want you to do it.
Then why don't you .
do something about it!
I don't know what did.
I don't know but .
I like the way you look.
If you'd like .
I don't think she's coming with us.
See you come here?
Now get out of my way!
He doesn't think like we do.
What do I get out of it?
Are we done now?
No now it's about us.
Come on right now.
I want you to go out the back.
You're going to have to go out the back.
So there you have it.
That I'd like to see.
What can you do about it?
I know where he's coming from.
I don't know who you are or where you come from but I don't like you.
That's it right?
That's would be me.
Oh come on don't feel bad.
What's this thing on my back?
I thought you'd get it.
I don't see that one at all.
It's been good to me.
Had to do what I had to do.
From me to you.
A lot of them.
We are not what you think.
Not all of us.
What did she do to me?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
The way what is going to be?
The way it's going to be.
What do you want with him?
You should do the same.
What say you to that?
And who might you be?
But I hope you know what you're doing.
How do we get him here?
The only hope now is to get him back here.
Oh do you like it?
What if he's not there?
Was he any good???
Was he any good?
You know what to do!
But what you were doing?
Yes just the two.
Oh just a little.
What do you think we should do?
I'm going down to see.
It wasn't bad.
How do you know they're done?
Tell what you see.
