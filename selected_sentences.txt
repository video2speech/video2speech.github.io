They do not!
They do to!
I hope so.
Let's go.
The ""real you"".
What good stuff?
Then that's all you had to say.
She's not a...
Not unless my sister goes.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You have my word.
You got something on your mind?
Well there's someone I think might be --
I want to know useful things.
I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
This is my head
Let me see what I can do.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
You're asking me out.
What's your name again?
Can we make this quick?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Where did he go?
He was just here.
Did you change your hair?
You know the deal.
It's more
It's just you.
I just wanted
I just wanted --
You set me up.
So did you
You looked beautiful last night you know.
God you're just like him!
That's not
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it.
So I did it.
Now I do.
Back then was a different story.
For a month
I do care.
Like you care.
Can we go now?
Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
What's normal?
What do you think?
Where've you been?
I have a date Daddy.
End of story.
Whatever that is.
It's tomorrow night --
Just for a minute
It's just a party.
It's starting.
Daddy people expect me to be there!
Exactly my point
End of discussion.
Daddy but there's this boy...
and I think he might ask...
Just sent 'em through.
The hell is that?
You told me that part already.
He's pretty!
Dead at forty-one.
This is it.
Like we had a choice?
You got him involved?
With me by your side.
That's what I just said
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Do you think we've got a plan or not?
What makes you think he'll do it?
What about him?
So what's the point?
That's her?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.
Who is she?
That girl -- I --
That I'm used to.
How many people go here?
How many people were in your old school?
People actually live there?
How'd you?
So they tell me...
You the new guy?
You get the girl.
What'd you do to her?
Then go get her
What 're you talking about?
It's off.
The whole thing.
So what does that give me?
What've you got for me?
Yeah -- we'll see.
And why would I do that?
Your sister here?
Not at all
Hey -- do you mind?
They're running the rest of me next month.
How'd you do it?
A deal's a deal.
It's about time.
Forget her sister then.
I got her under control.
I'm on it
Fifty and you've got your man.
Take it or leave it.
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
I'll get right on it.
I want you to go out with her.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
We're old friend*
Someone who's up for the job.
We're not.
Well actually I thought I'd run an idea by you.
You know just to see if you're interested.
Are you lost?
Have you seen him?
Something new and different for us.
We're making a statement.
Listen to you!
Can you even imagine?
You went to the party?
What'd he say?
You think this'll work?
Does it matter?
Do you mind?
I have no say at all.
You could always go with me.
What's this?
Just a little.
He always look so
The one who was gone for a year?
Who's that?
Is that right?
I thought you could use it.
You bought this?
What was it like?
You were paid to take me out!
I knew it was a set-up!
That's where I was last year.
I was wrong.
It's just something I had.
There's nothing in it for me.
Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
You know what I mean
No one else knows
And completely hot for me.
No -- something real.
Something no one else knows.
Tell me something true.
You up for it?
Something like that
Put your right foot there --
It's not that bad
So what did I have an effect on?
You 're so --
What are you doing here?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Oh so now you think you know me?
I should do this.
Then why'd you ask?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
I saw you there.
And I'm in control of it.
You know what they say
I hate him.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Just let me sit down.
Like you could find one
Sure I do
I told you
Why 're you doing this?
Not that I could tell the difference...
You're not okay.
I'm fine.
Funny you're the only one
I saw your car.
I know a lot more than that
The night I take you to places you've never been before.
Pick you up Friday then
I already sent 'em a check.
When I go?
What's the matter?
Parts of it.
Was that your sister?
You're eighteen.
Am I supposed to feel better?
Like right now?
Or do I have some time to think about it?
People can hear you.
You were right.
Just for now.
That's where we can help you.
See you next week!
What should we talk about?
I missed you.
Did I have anything to say about it?
What just happened?
But -- who -- what --?
Is that what you think happens?
Let her go.
We should have seen land.
With a face like that?
If they agree to follow me yes.
Your life and that of others!
You can see for yourself.
What is it now?
Do you think I care?
I'm a free man again.
They took everything...
you're so beautiful!
She said yes.
I find that hard to believe.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
But you're never here!
that's true.
I could be gone for years.
How could I be?
Exactly as I said it would.
How far from here?
Is it not so?
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I want you to tell me everything you remember Father.
From the beginning.
He never had one...
What does he say?
I am not listening Father.
What are you listening to?
This time with me!
Yes I do...
On all of them!
There'll be a time.
I want to go with you!
What do you see?
Look out of that window.
I am not afraid of you.
Do I have so many already?
You used to know how to speak to me.
You did the same to your God!
Look what they did!
Ask him if he will help.
We will work with his people.
To bring the word of God.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.
You speak first!
What is it?
Say not here!
So you are a new man?
I knew you would.
You'll always be older than me Father.
I suppose we're both old men now.
My son my son...
You know that I am right Father.
You must tell them!
You must tell your men!
I am not sure...
What are you saying?
I am listening my son.
All of them!
Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
You must wait.
and already you're a dead man.
So was Christ!
How can you be so certain?
That's what it says.
That's in a week!
Father I am doing what I think is the best for him.
I must see them with my own eyes.
There is one thing I'd like to understand...
Why do you want to go back after all this?
I know what I see.
Who's not afraid.
I see a women who thinks...
Surely you can do anything you want.
I should not even be listening to you since my council said no.
Have you anything to say?
Not my horse.
We came here to stay!
You want a war?
We are a thousand.
What's he doing?
What do you read?
Come over here.
But I've never seen it used at night before.
It's the men Sir.
They wonder how you know our position.
And may God be with us...
You're right.
Let the men decide.
You tell that to them!
All we can do now is go forward!
Think about that!
You never did.
You did all the talking for both of us remember?
And then what?
You know that!
The land is there.
I know it!
We're lost!
Six days ago yes.
Where can I meet this man?
But there is worse.
We must give time for time.
Call him back!
Can I see your back?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
That's what he did to me.
Put it out.
Tell me about yourself.
What you did as a young boy...
what your parents were like.
Give me another one please.
Why you're here.
What else do you need?
Say yes or no.
But it's...
I would say...
Half is fair.
What's your cut?
Think about yourself.
No he is here.
No question about that.
I was all of these.
I brought you some letters.
One wants to buy you clothes another sent a check.
Another wants a check.
I'm coming with him.
Yes come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Take it easy.
Stay with me.
What do you need?
What are you looking for?
I have your money.
Do you really want me to forget about you?
Forget about me.
You have enough problems of your own.
What are you doing?
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Do you have coffee?
No matter what happens...
I'm sorry.
Are you alright?
All this time.
Never being able to look anyone in the eyes.
Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.
That's not me.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
What are you asking me?
I came here.
I had no money.
I knew no one.
it's not who I am.
What about back home?
I've been in these clothes since...
Could we stop at your place?
Look we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here.
Like the South here.
Whether you tell us or not we'll find out.
Better if it comes from you.
You know these people?
How about that?
The case is all yours.
It was my decision not his.
There's nothing to talk about.
You'd have the good to weight against the bad!
What was I supposed to do?
That's nice.
Are you out of your fucking mind??
Did you take one too?
We stopped there...
I called and you're not here.
Where the hell have you been?!
You got that?
I'm okay.
Are you hit?
Stay with her.
The other side of the street.
Stay this side.
Here - make yourself useful.
It's okay.
Where is she?
What's he looking for?
That's me.
Second guy with him was...
I told him where she works.
They were just here.
Another guy came in asking me about her too.
Did you tell him you did?
What's wrong?
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who's there?
I like you.
Why'd you stand up for me like that?
That's how you help her.
And when you get out there they know your face.
You're dead.
Okay tell you what I'll give you a head start.
You take her to the station house.
You know what I'm saying here.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
Look - let me talk to her.
Even if that story is true.
Something back home?
Is that all there is?
Why are you afraid
' at the bad guy!
Better than one.
I'll call it...
If you win you can come with me.
I'll let you know what happens.
But what if it does?
You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
You got any better ideas?
Maybe I'll learn something.
There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll come with you.
Look I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.
Maybe she saw something.
What would you call her?
You were right they were both dead before the fire.
What about the report?
But I would like to ask you something.
You got a problem with me?
Well just so you know.
Watch the news?
You can do what you want.
No what is it?
You know what that is right?
And write books.
What do you want?
See you later.
How's that...
Would that be a good thing.
I love you.
I'll do that.
We'll talk.
You'll be great.
You'll be fine.
I'll tell you tonight.
Let's do it tonight.
As soon as you get back we'll talk.
No listen to me here.
I want to know what you're talking about.
That is great.
Well that's great.
That's good.
Hold that thought just for a second.
Just hold that thought.
Can you call back?
Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Look at this.
You're not so bad yourself.
That was good.
Yes you are.
You could give me something.
I'm not.
Maybe I should just ya know...
Oh I'm sorry.
What is your problem?
I just wanted a statement.
Now's not a good time.
Alright cut cut cut.
now is not a good time okay.
He's fine.
He'll be fine.
Is that correct?
We have some things to take care of.
When I have more I'll let you know.
It's much too early.
There's a lot to be done.
Any chance we can do that again?
Keep them out of my way.
Stay behind me.
And he still went to the party.
they were late for a party.
Let's see...
How old are you?
It's all true!
Now -- I get it.
How old are your kids?
I mean what do I got left?
I understand that.
And what kind of work do you do?
Wait a minute.
And they will show it.
We'll talk about that.
Let her go!
Let her go!!
You'll be my first.
My father was.
Now it's my friend.
Listen to me.
Do we have a problem here?
There's no reason to have a problem.
Baby I'm anybody you want me to be.
I'd like to speak for himself okay?
How long are you planning to stay?
I want to talk to you together.
Is there a problem?
Please join us.
Come on forward.
Is he with you?
Can you show me?
Two weeks holiday.
In here says he wants a million.
This all you want?
This is his case.
Who is he?
And I hate you.
I fucking hate you.
I'm serious...
this - this is a great American film.
I thought it was my idea.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
This is my project.
I'm serious.
I gave you half of what they gave me.
Look - here we are!
Why do you say I and not we?
He has nothing to say.
But what good is money there?
Oh - I got it.
Hold it this way.
What does it look like?
What is that?
I hate looking at that!
I'll do it.
Turn that fucking thing off!
Why should I carry your bag?
I am not a dog.
Turn that off!
We have no money.
I heard enough of it in school!
Did you hear what I said?
Just do what I do.
Say the same thing I say.
We started over you can too.
It's easy to learn.
Yes the money is good.
I can get you a job.
Look at the way we live.
You think I'd be working if I had money?!
We spent it!
Get my money!
You know me...
Where's the money?
You want the tape?
There it is!
Have a drink.
You've got a call.
I was his friend!
And you you'll pay for what you did!
He thinks he's in love.
We were having lunch here.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
What do you mean you know?
Land of the free.
A land where anyone can be anything.
As long as they are white.
What are you coming here to do?
Yes we're in New York now.
But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Then answer my questions.
Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
How do you know one another?
he's my friend.
He's yours but I take him in!
He's mine!
I'll take him.
What was that?
You got to hand it to them.
That's what it looks like to me.
You're lucky you're walking away from this.
Now you happy?
How did you start the fire this time?
What the hell happened?
How was it?
Where're you hit?!
You go home.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.
He knew all along.
Wish I had a picture of it.
But you knew that right?
Let it run.
Oh yeah why?
Who the hell let them up there?
Where you been man?
GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!
Take the car.
Look I'm in here.
How could I know.
I'm not a doctor.
We're trying to get there.
I hope we can.
She's wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes but I'd love to.
You're looking wonderful.
It's the last one.
What's up?
Well that's something.
That's true.
Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes I thought so.
I suppose so.
I never did either.
Well what do you think we ought to do about it?
It's possible.
That's right.
Sure what is it?
Dave if you've a minute I'd like your advice on something.
Okay come on down.
coming in please.
Look Dave your've probably got a lot to do.
I suggest you leave it to me.
Let me have the control please.
There's no need for you to trouble.
Yes it is.
Anything that might account for this problem?
Yes I know that.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes I know.
Sure Dave what's up?
We'll take care of it.
He's got a point.
it's silly but...
Well what is it?
I got mine about the same time.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon.
All right Darling?
Thank you Daddy.
Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
How many days until you come home?
Well I have to go now.
Where is Mrs.
One two three.
In three days darling I hope.
When are you coming home?
Are you coming to my party?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
I'm fine Daddy.
I'm at Space Station Five darling.
How are you?
Oh thank you very much.
Well I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.
conference in June.
No thank you...
Well where are all of you off to?
As a matter of fact she's six tomorrow.
Yes it's coming along very well.
Yes I think so.
Just about then.
I was just on my way down to meet you.
How do you do Mr.
Is this in fact what has happened?
I'm sorry but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes really thank you very much.
Are you quite sure?
If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well not really.
Yes it does.
Well I'm sorry about that.
Well I'll tell you why I ask.
What do you mean?
Oh no thank you.
The two girls have taken wonderful care of me.
I'm just fine.
Is there anything we can do for you?
It looks like we have another bad A.
Is that true?
That's true
Is this true?
Great just great.
That we do.
I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah I've been busy.
This is three years old.
I want to pick up my car.
It's the only thing I know.
Hey what about me?
Just do what I say okay?
We'll pay for the girls and have a good time...
They always let me do anything.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay...
they let you do anything.
how'd that be?
Buy yourself something pretty.
I'd do it but I got to go.
Here you go baby.
I think we can do a little business.
As a matter of fact I think we can have a party.
Well maybe I'll see you later...
What's the matter with my place?
Look there's a place across the street.
We can go right over there...
Yeah i been waiting three years.
No I go to a school to learn how to do hair.
Hey what kind of talk is that?
In the back.
You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.
You always were his girls...
I used to go with him...
How about it?
I said police.
You're done.
I got hit.
I got his money...
I got everything...
What are you talking about?
It's your money.
It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Hey there she is...
Yeah too bad.
We gave 'em a good run at it.
I feel like I let you down.
I'll buy you one.
It'll be my good-bye present.
Got all my money.
Hey how'd my car get here?
That was quick.
All I need is some money for the room.
Yeah I see her.
You sure that's the reason?
Tell me something.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Made a phone call.
I'll be there in a minute.
What took you so long to call man?
You stay with me...
We're getting too close...
That's common sense.
I let women get to me.
He's in another world.
I had no choice.
You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait.
For three years?
Depends on how things work out.
He's after your money.
Just tell me about the money.
Half a million.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
That's how you'll tell the story.
You want to try again?
I got this under control.
My kind of place.
The bet's off.
And whatever it is you're part of it.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose...
That's never been one of my problems.
I got two problems.
Back you up?
Just back me up like you've got a piece...
I heard him talk about it.
Tell me a little about her.
You have a good time?
I know of a place.
Let's go eat.
And I want some food some place nice..
Some good people nice music...
We eat when I say we eat.
We're on the move.
if there is one.
Want to try it again?
Hey this works pretty good.
not before you been a help to me.
Just up the street the other side over there...
I may call you worse than that.
It happens to be my name.
We go to him right away.
Okay let's get down to it.
I did my part and got you out.
I'm already sorry.
Hey no way.
You got a girl...
I already got that department taken care of...
Listen it may be a little out of date.
I'll think about it.
I got to be on the street.
Maybe I just need some help.
You here to write my life story?
Sure anything you want.
And let's talk in private okay?
Now you're in the shit and so's the department.
Anybody could have done better especially you.
How did they get away?
I lost them that's what happened.
I'll keep it in mind.
He starts to go.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far...
I want it back.
Yeah I read the report...
we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
He was in some bar.
See you in the morning...
you know you ought to get some rest...
I got to wait for a call.
How about you?
Nothing came in for me yet?
Long night too from what I heard...
So do you...
been a long day.
You look awful.
Can we find them?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
He was in on the same job.
Wait a minute wait a minute...
who's this?
Who are all these?
This guy must have had a.
Now he's got yours.
I'll help you out.
I think I met her.
I think you do know where he is.
where is he?
That's what I always say.
ah never mind...
Where is he?
Three more hours...
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
What do I know?
Oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out.
How do you know?
I've been better...
You real down?
I can see that.
Pardon me for saying so but you look like shit.
We've had a hard night.
Just a second that's all!
I'm sorry...
Some lady called.
She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight...
I get that.
The job first.
Everything else especially me second.
I get it.
I'm not like you.
Here it comes again...
I like to get the job done right.
I'm for shit.
Sure okay fine no problem...
First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows...
You made the front page.
Great place for lunch.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah for some reason I'm sure...
You sure you want me to?
Call me later.
That's the way I see it too.
I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
What do you want to know?
What difference does it make?
I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.
I make you feel good.
You make me feel good.
What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
I think that if you need bigger and better things...
Hey you know what I really think?
I work in a bar right?
You are what you do...
What'd you do?
What's wrong with that?
Hey you're right.
This is a.
What am I wanted for?
Hey two days with him is enough.
How would you know?
Hard man to live with.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...
I heard a lot about you.
Who the hell are you?
Alright I'm coming...
What the hell's wrong?
We'll follow you.
Yeah old times.
We got a lot to talk about.
How hot are they?
First the money.
After that I'll get the money to you right away...
I can get you the money.
I'll got your money to you.
You got no right for this kind of play.
Try and take it.
Give it back.
Yeah I know that but this is me and we're old friends.
I'm sure.
You want to go outside?
Not bad not bad.
How you doing man?
You know exactly where they are!
Where is it?
At your service.
Look at all these little things...
So full of..
No thank you.
would you like a drink?
You are so wrong.
Let me explain...
What's wrong with me?
so tell me...
I remember you now..
nice to see you again
That's what I'm saying.
Yes of course but...
They have to be open for it to work.
There's no light!
When is she not in trouble?
Yeah I know...
to save the world...
but no thanks.
We have to save the world.
That's what I thought.
Just one thing!
She said something to me a while ago and...
She's fine really..
just needs some rest..
I might call to check up on her you know...
to see if she's better?
That's fine!
Thank you very much.

We have to open them!
How does it work?
You're nothing but a...
It's difficult.
No not at all!

What's the matter?...
Do I look bad?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Here we go again...
Do you know how we say ""make love""?
I know how to say ""Hello"".
Now it's your turn!
sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Not hard to find you...
I'll be right with you.
You hear that?
see good in bad..
You right that is bad..
I bet you lunch!
with my wife.
Is good news I sure!
It's not?
Been here long?
Almost like it was...
It's not that easy..
How much time is left?
I want your best man on this!
I'm about to Mr.
Wait or act.
Not yet Sir..
Is that better?
I can hear you Mr.
Only too well...
all the hope..
they already know too much..
Right away Sir.
Who gives a shit!
How's that?
Can you hear me better now?
Fine just fine!
How's our deal coming along?
Do you have the picture now Mr.
Not far now.
not at all.
Where are you?
I just talked to her.
It was in the paper...
she's dead.
She's all I've got.
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Look where we are.
Look at yourself.
You should have.
I was in hell.
If I called you...
I wanted to call.
You're sorry?
What was I supposed to think?
It has to be this way for now.
What happened to you?
I'm on my way.
I'll be back at the house in three hours.
Do it now.
Where have you been...
I'll give it two months two months at most then I'll be back.
It's better that way.
I'm not using him again for anything.
I'll call the guy.
Business was fine.
We've been all through that.
Okay I believe you.
I mean is this what I get first thing?
What's this...
Do you know how much I missed you?
You know where I can get it?
I have a lot of money to spend.
Buy five, get one free.
What are these?
Nobody knows anything.
Think about it.
I'm telling you...
I just got a call...
I'll get it.
he's got nothing to do with this...
Look, he's got nothing to do with this...
let him go...
Friend of yours?
I remember him.
You remember Mr.
What are you...
What are these for?
They should be here any minute.
Where are the women?
You brought the money?
Where's that?
He's in.
Machine's in?
I'll do this for you.
Thank you for your time.
I hope we can do business.
What's the problem?
You have a beautiful face...
I'd like to take your picture.
We can do that.
He might be interested...
but it would mean another five thousand.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
I'll consider it.
I want to watch you work.
And they are?
What we're looking for is rather specific.
You said something about money.
What can I do for you today?
Thank you for seeing us.
First things first.
You might want to watch this, Mr.
You're a dead man.
Is that him?
It's good what you're doing.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.
Well, that's all I can do.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either.
That's the last they saw her.
They want to see if I can I.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
What can I do for you, Mr.
""  Almost makes you worse.
Easy enough for you.
You think it's so easy?
What do you think...
Show me where.
out there somewhere.
What did you do with her body?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Tell me what happened.
Made me sick but what did I care?
It was just something I was doing for money.
You enjoy it?
I felt like it.
I never saw anyone get done before.
That's what happened.
She's dead.
She's been dead a long fucking time.
I want to know.
I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Something like that.
And she never walked out.
It was a lot of fucking money.
That's all?
How much did he pay you?
Okay we'll come back to that.
I want his name.
Who is Machine?
How'd you find me here?
How much did he tell you he had...
What's he talking about?
Six years ago...
Who is this.
I know what you did.
Yeah who's this?
Where do you get this stuff?
People eat this stuff up.
Look at him.
How much did he give you how much did he keep for himself?
Give me the film.
You'll get it when we get there.
What other reason were you looking for?
A man like Mr.
all his money all his power...
I'm asking.
You're asking me why?
Just tell me.
Wanted them to find you one.
They're no friends of mine.
Never mind how I found you.
How'd you find me?
Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Well whatever reasons Mrs.
Of what sort?
I'm listening.
Yes I do have something to say.
It's not my money.
Let's not make a big deal out of this okay?
Go run for President.
It's money.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
What's next?
Nobody knows his name.
That's his thing.
You never see his face.
Who is he, his name?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business.
What have you got for me?
I'll call back.
Well, I'm in New York now.
Alright, I get the picture.
Where does he sell it?
His stuff comes out of New York.
Who'd have thought it?
You have any kids?
What about me?
Run for President?
I work a job.
Where are your parents?
No one knows where it comes from.
There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
Who do you see?
I heard you asking.
There's no such thing.
I've never seen one.
Know what else?
Know what I mean?
See you then.
Tomorrow night I get off at eight.
Here's my number if you need it...
When can you start?
I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Four hundred a week off the books.
How much do you make now?
What are you doing out here?
If I ask and you are you have to tell me.
If not speak now.
Three four years.
How long you been working there?
Good for you.
I need some information.
Thought you might be able to help.
Told you you would.
You know how it is.
Big date tonight?
How will I get it to you?
Nothing more than a bother.
Have you any news for me?
I hope it's nothing serious.
You told me to look so I looked.
It sure could have.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I'm here.
Okay I follow you so far...
I'm not positive this means anything.
I know what I'm asking.
You saw what he did to her.
I've thought about it and there's no other way.
If you can find them I will take their names to the police.
you need to go to the police.
But I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I'm sure it is.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Please believe me.
please will you sit down a moment?
It's a film...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
There was nothing he could do.
My husband left everything to me.
I felt these were my husband's private things.
I knew about it but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.
Not till now that is.
Other than that there's never any reason.
Hard even for me to imagine.
He was a good man.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Two weeks ago now.
Asking about you.
Please sit here...
He's odd.
I try to be.
She's been dead all this time...
why are you doing this to me...
They brought her into the room...
they did terrible things to her...
Who is this...
she wanted to start over.
What are you talking about...
I have to tell you something.
If you read it you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
You just left...
Do you remember I was there a few weeks ago...
What am I supposed to do?
If I had a choice...
It's been six years.
every single time I still think it's her.
They could have missed something.
She would have told me...
she would have told me...
Will you let me look?
how can you say that to me...?
It is possible...
She might have wanted to tell you something...
I think so.
Do you think the police did a good job?
The police looked.
I've got what I need for my report.
You should be.
We're all like that.
Then something horrible happens...
Maybe we can finish tomorrow.
I'll call tomorrow...
People remember me from the news.
Can you drive me back now?
No one knows what it's like.
I had to ask.
It got to be too much for him.
Why do you think he did it?
he was living with a friend...
What was she running from?
For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.
One night we went to bed...
the next morning she was gone.
She took some clothes.
She just seemed...
Want to know what it's really like?
That's exactly what I am.
Is this information correct...
What was the name...
I've got it here somewhere...
I'll do what I can.
What is this?
I'm trying to find out.
I'm looking into it for her parents.
Do you know what happened to her?
I remember her.
You're sure?
Please Sister will you take another look make sure...
If that's all...
No sir he is not.
If you could bag it I'll be on my way thank you.
No you may not.
Okay I'll take it all.
Then we'll stay up together.
Figure it out?!?!
Not while he's using me.
We'll figure it out.
It was bad.
Was it a bad one?
I brought my friends in to help me.
Remember you're in control.
You could do worse.
Yeah I'm not so sure.
I'm sure they're around.
Here you are.
Where were you this morning?
Then you saw him too?
You've been up all night?
Save it for later.
You look great!
She's gone.
What the hell was that?
Something's wrong here.
Here we are.
It's okay we're just about there.
Cut that shit out.
Maybe before but not now.
I want to help you.
I'm on your side.
You just feel sorry for me.
We have to stop him I'm with you.
Try what other kids did.
Then what else can we do?
Is there something we can do?
Someone to bring them to him.
He took her.
It was awful.
It was awful...
Tell him I was looking for him okay?
You're his sister right?
I saw it.
Give her time.
You ever look over this town's history?
Anyway if I'm next watch your back.
How she doing?
Hey man we're all sorry...
So what's up?
What'd I miss?
Let me talk to you.
I'll just be a moment.
It'll help...
We're with you.
It's no just a house.
It's his home.
He's waiting there for me...
I'll tell you later.
It's no story.
You just stay put.
You need rest.
You're not taking my baby!
He is my responsibility.
What I what?
Well I've thought about it.
I plan to keep him.
He says it's easy.
That's how he found me.
He needs us both.
My friend with the funny hand.
Who said I...
No you're not.
I'm sure that's not true.
I would be.
Is that who you're waiting for?
I just wanted to see if you were all right.
How did you know that?
My name is...
There you go.
Well not exactly...
it's that...
For the first time since...
He'll show up.
it's just...
You're coming home.
I've got to go.
No I'm not.
I sort of hope it's a boy.
Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
How was the meeting?
Daddy he's coming back...
Make them understand.
It's just across the park.
Thanks for everything Dad.
To take a picture.
That's in the past.
That's okay.
It must be!
So that's him.
What do you think I'm doing?
And so is your baby.
You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Ask him to show you his hands.
What's wrong with the baby?
How's he doing it?
You said so.
What's that got to do with it?
They're waiting for us...
Did everyone call everyone?
He's found some other way.
Good to see you again Mr.
Had kind of a long night.
They never did put her under.
No it's our problem Mark.
That's their problem.
Then we'll find another way.
No I want him.
There's a lot to tell.
Nobody thinks that.
for being in love with her?
Then get out!
I thought about that.
Could we interest you in someone else?
Mark are you okay?
I've got to write some of this down.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.
Have some anyway.
I could've gone all night without looking at that.
He's right.
You know my mother -- get real.
Let's just party at your place.
Meet me later.
Oh what's that?
All of us.
He was under pressure.
We all are.
I want to talk about the baby.
Have another one sounds like you need it.
Stick around please?
Two hours a day six days a week.
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But now - I wonder -
That may be.
Matter of fact he's much better.
He's left the hospital.
He's not -?
'  This came for you.
Not in two days.
You could train someone else.
He'll be all right.
But it was out of the question his coming along.
How is he -?
It was supposed to be.
'  I thought it was your father.
Oh it does???
Here - keep these.
We'll have to look for them later.
Somewhere down there?
Maybe you've been down here too long.
I think you're right.
What's more important - there's our problem.
How about that!
You all wait here.
Sounds like it!
I've seen it all right.
A lot of people think like that.
There goes the best reason I know!
What about down?
Seems to be all around...
Is there any way out of it?
We're dead in the water.
Why do you say that?
What about time...?
Now they feel it...
We read you!
I believe our friend...
Nothing we can do now.
That's what I said!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
It'll be all right.
We're old friends!
He'll be - -
I did go.
see your way?
It is a living thing.
Why not me?
I am afraid not.
Point of view is everything.
All right - go to it.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Or perhaps until he gets us?
until we get him!
I'll be another!
Well I'll be -!
They had to get rid of him.
This is from three years ago.
I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Let me ask you a question.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.
Always has been.
Well you look...
I'm sorry about your mother.
But I'm okay.
I got some more bad news.
I know about that.
The bad news --
Same old shit.
What are you boys up to?
Whatever you say.
I'll send you the five hundred.
Hard to say.
how much will the whole thing cost?
No not exactly.
I plan to.
I agreed with everything she said.
I wanted her to like me.
I just want to be a good father.
That was me.
We bought you.
Maybe I can buy him off.
He's on to us!
No of course not.
Just say it that's all.
You'll get your money.
I mean he never paid me.
Might as well take the rest of the day off.
Called it right in.
You see it?
You heard the news.
I used to play ball.
And you'll have him by coffee time.
You understand what I'm saying?
You think so.
If you get it?
Tell you what.
What do you mean I got money?
I mean it -- you got enough money now.
Open the door.
We're late.
Open the door will ya?
Out of this fucking job.
I'm fucking out of here.
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Right's right.
You're not making any sense man.
I know you did.
Saw him do it?
Sure you did.
Like I said.
Not even in the service.
Must be something.
How'd I know?
You bring him up yourself?
Move this thing will you?
See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there okay?
How'd you get the job?
Pay's good though.
Which I can do.
You're lucky.
Here have a hit.
I know you got problems but everybody's got problems.
Okay let's go home then.
I want to go home.
For the food business.
What are you sorry for?
So we'll get what you want.
Same thing Daddy.
We need lunch.
What do you want then?
What do you say?
You know that.
It's bad for you.
It's his.
It's pretty old.
My car's in the shop.
This'll be fine.
Can you stay for a while?
That's fine with me too.
Sit right there by yourself if you want.
Wait for her by yourself.
That's fine with me.
Where do you expect to wait for her?
Think you can stand it that long?
That's all you got to say?
She's gone already!
I told her I wanted to come home.
Come and get you!
She said she'd come and get me.
Tomorrow morning you still want to go home I'll drive you down.
I'll get off work or something.
But I want to go home.
You are home.
There are lots of kids you still know here.
You find anybody you know here?
There must be some kids you used to know from school.
You want to go tomorrow?
See your old teachers?
Oh Jesus come on will you?
Join the other kids.
It's stupid.
It's not that.
You know these kids from when you went to school here.
Some of those kids you still know.
From your mother?
I just think you used to be bad.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
It's not funny now.
But it's not funny now.
To us it was.
Was it funny?
Nothing really mean.
It was kind of funny then.
Stuff like that.
Why do they do that?
look out there.
It's too late.
They're out.
They're still out.
Now I'm free.
All you got to do is give back what the man gave you and you're free of him.
I've got to call my brother.
He's using you.
Why should I always pay more sell cheap?
Want to buy?
What's the difference?
Before he knew.
No big deal.
Let it go.
What do I have to do for it?
On what you pay me?
Sorry about the long lunch.
I remember you from high school.
You're a teacher now?
I'm fine fine.
Well right now we're not too interested.
A few things.
He'll know what happened.
He fucking better.
I wish you had.
That's what usually happens.
I heard that.
Turn it off.
We got to get moving: I got to get up there.
How would I know?
That's what I love about a small town.
You know everybody.
That's why she left.
I'm not saying that.
It's coming down tonight.
Got here just in time.
You know what I'm talking about.
For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much.
Low as what?
What have I done?
You make me sick.
She'll be right out.
Let the past be.
It's just...
We should talk.
It's too...
it's too far.
I'm not making it any worse.
Believe it or not.
Where is she now?
I know who it is.
Did you get his number?
What was wrong?
I heard you talking.
What on earth is happening to you?
I would've heard.
Think they're alright?
Are you sure they're home?
Did you call?
I know your parents.
Did you tell them?
That we were coming?
It was to the same woman.
Something for you and me to talk about and think about.
I've been thinking about it that's all.
There's another thing I've been thinking about.
You and me.
I'm her father -- supposed to be but I'm not able to.
Yes I am.
It's nice.
After making love.
I like it.
Yeah but never what you looked like.
But not now.
Not for money.
He's a lot like I was at his age.
Lots of people.
Everybody needs money.
People like that.
How can you even think such a thing?
Now he's like everyone else.
There's lots funny about it actually.
More than most.
But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Let's get together.
I've been thinking about it a lot.
And I pay her.
Work it out with her tell her how you feel.
I mean that.
I'm sorry about what I said.
See you tomorrow maybe.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party give me a call okay?
I'm off.
She's fine.
How's she doing?
For a while.
She's dead then?
You're not using it today?
Doing your fucking job.
I watch television too.
I'm just --
What the hell are you talking about?
No it's a...
it's a traffic thing.
Something about my father?
Well yeah I suppose.
I'm the local police officer.
Well yes I'm...
I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father Mrs.
We were up very late.
No he's out now.
I'd stay away from him if I were you.
You mean my old office.
Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Little while ago.
how'd you hear that?
The other guy.
That's what it sounds like.
Not since last night.
I been that plenty and I know the difference.
This is different.
What it says is wrong.
It's a good idea good for you good for the town.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink.
Not a fucking thing.
I need to get me to town!
Everything you know is from me.
Call it what you want.
I'm made of love!
Like a man done it.
Done it right.
By Christ you -- I know you.
You think you can take me now?
Come on try.
Tell how it's no big deal.
Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
I thought she was alright.
Till this morning she was.
In the living room.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
She's coming.
We're alright.
You want me to get her?
Been a while.
Like some coffee?
You got something to say say it!
Just do it.
You'll thank me for this one day.
Let them work on this.
I know what it means.
I'm just running out of ways to use it.
That's what you think.
Well I never heard that one.
It may have happened but not the way you said.
Of course it happened.
I care about what happened.
Who'd pay him that kind of money?
Well your friend I think.
Want to know what I think happened?
I want to let the gas run out.
What about her?
Anyone else want one?
Maybe you can help me.
She wanted to go home.
How was she?
No not tonight.
I'm in bed too.
Maybe you do too.
He's my best friend.
There was something.
It happened up your way.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
I know exactly how you feel.
That's not really the point.
Your father never means to be so...
No it's okay.
After all he is the President right?
He's in a meeting.
It was great...
We'll talk at home.
We'll talk about this back...
I'm sure he's busy.
That's the way of the world little one.
She was my friend.
Top of your class?
I met their parents.
That's good for a girl your age.
There they are!
I got you.
You're okay.
oh my god...
Been better Dad...
It's cut.
Do you see them?
Okay it's on.
I'll take you all the way in.
I'm doing what I can.
He's busy being dead.
You read my mind.
He's dead then.
Wrote it last night.
What on earth for?
What do you think it means?
Can we do that?
Does your office have anything to add Mr.
Call the White House.
Where are we now?
Not even close.
It's the only place.
Well it worked.
why did they do that?
It must be.
Who did this?
Any of us?
*                     Please tell me your name.
We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
You can follow me then.
You got what you wanted.
Say something dear.
She's right here.
So is this.
That was war.
They were people too yes...
but they were not your people.
How can you?
I mean they're people.
I do what is necessary.
Do you enjoy it?
I know he left you behind.
What do you know of my husband?
Or you will do what Mrs.
Your husband on the other hand...
What do you want with us?
Yes I'll do it.
You'll do it?
This is between you and me.
Over my dead body.
You've made yourself quite clear.
You heard me.
Sir we stay with the President.
Eighteen thousand feet sir.
come with me.
Both of you.
I'll be back.
I wish it were that easy...
But that's the point Jim.
We're right here.
I miss you.
And I miss her.
You know what?
And when have I had five minutes?
She's a big girl.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Actually sir you could be that someone.
White House Situation room.
I thought about this Mr.
Not as long as I'm President.
But this is different sir.
You're the President.
You know my policy.
Did they say anything about my family?
Where's my family?
Just put the....
if you're the President when's your wife's birthday?
Let me talk to anyone.
Sir the President does not call this particular number.
This is the President.
IT'S OPEN!
Twenty five minutes.
They should be here any moment.
Twenty-five years.
Where the hell are we?
I never left.
President how the hell did you get on board?
they're ready for you in the conference room.
That's my job.
Other way around sir.
What's the story?
I just wish it was that simple.
Yes it did.
Yes I did...
Did you feel that?
You better take this.
You better check on it Mr.
Set course change!
Are you afraid?
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
The word is sick.
You should never have left the hospital.
We had something very special but it's all over.
I have to get in there.
What are you...?
That's the way I want it.
Just turn the radio on and go.
If that's the way you want it.
He's been here twenty years that's all he says.
It'll make you feel a lot better.
You're just making things difficult for yourself.
It's all here!
There's nothing wrong with me!
It's got to be stopped!
We have to talk.
Let me show you.
This area this area here here here under here here...
We can be friends!
That's my girl.
I'm a very lucky woman.
What about tonight -- just you and me.
Life support check.
You're a woman.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's not possible.
Anyway she was asking for it!
They're all asking for it all the time!!
A whole new world new kids to play with.
He's a boy dog.
Can I hold him?
What's his name?
Is it really worth it?
That's how I want them.
What should I say?
Let's move.
I'll explain everything.
Let's go Daddy.
We have to check in.
But that's not a door.
The door's over there.
All right it's a matter of death.
You'll have to be more specific than that sir.
It's a matter of life or death.
Pull yourself together!
We've got to...
I'm getting out.
We really were in love.
Love changes on its own.
Love's the same as it always was.
It's people who change.
Do you want to talk about it.
No I mean your head.
I'll take a look at it.
I'm getting over it.
oh thank you.
It's nothing.
Can I be of some help?
you've done the same for me.
I'm sure we'll both make it...
but just in case one of us...
That's a lovely name.
full names I mean.
Well I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me.
You know so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...
I take it black.
Like my men.
That's very nice of you.
get used to it.
Come in Paul.
That's for sure.
I'm doing everything I can!
Surely there must be something you can do.
We're running out of time.
Yes everything they've got.
When do we start down?
Let's see.
I'm not sure.
What is it Doctor?
What's happening?
not for another two hours.
No one that I know of.
Just how serious is it doctor?
He had fish too.
Let's see now.
He had fish.
What did he have?
Yes yes I remember.
Well we had a choice.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
But that's not important right now.
We've got to land as soon as we can.
Yes of course.
Could you come and take a look at them?
Are you a doctor?
What went wrong?
I've lost number three.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
I think they're getting the hang of it!
What's his problem?
I remember how you used to hold me...
When it did it was almost like...
only for us.
I remember everything.
But it will be different...
like it was in the beginning.
I worry about you so much.
But if you'll just give me...
You expect me to believe that?
Look you'll be back in town tomorrow night.
We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
It takes so many things to make love last.
Who wants to be first?
Hey we've been waiting for you.
We'd better get back now.
Good-bye darling.
I love you darling.
Good-bye Bill.
So long darling.
Take care of yourself.
Oh Bill I'll keep it.
I'll keep it with me all the time.
All right he's on final now!
He's all over the place!
Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet!
Yeah I think he is.
I've seen you play.
I know you.
Oh I'd love to.
We'll get back to you very quickly.
We both had fish.
Well the doctor will be with you in just a moment.
One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
My husband is very sick.
Can you do something please?
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Let him stay up here.
Oh yes I saw.
Would you go up please?
Do you feel all right sir?
with one of us?
Maybe he knows.
He comes and he goes.
You've got me all wrong.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
That sounds interesting.
She did did she?
Well she was wrong.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
He's not here.
Why ask me?
We are with the Police Department.
He and I along with seven or eight others.
This is getting out of hand.
I want you to deal with it.
You look very good.
You understand that.
But how many others will?
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Tell me about it...
No he's not.
What is this?!
Down that side street.
What's this about George?
I know that look.
It'd be for your own good.
by the book.
I have to find it.
Where have they taken it?
We need to have the evidence ya know?
Jesus this is major.
Why'd you hold out on me?
I am sure not.
That is why I am so concerned...
But none of my people know how to make it.
Where did he get it?
We all did.
You've taken it?
Am I right?
What's this nothing shit?
What was that about?
It's all right George.
Just wait here all right?
Stop the car!
Please I must get out here.
Stop the car.
I must call my wife...
Where'd you get this?!!
Yeah go home.
I hope you can understand how special your world is...
""  You're not...
You will be taking Sunday off then...
Next time you see him tell him to call me...
Yeah that's it.
And what was that one about my mother?
That was a good one.
I'll bet.
It's good.
Which one is that?
We learn quickly.
I knew that...
We did not get to stay with our friends...
You know that guy?
But see -- now I've got a problem.
Back off George.
At the end of the bar.
Who said that?
Agree to work with me?
Why'd I do what?
Why did you do it?
Listen we just need a minute of your time...
He has not been home since that day.
But she told me where to find him.
Did you talk to him?
But she said her son might.
What about the other guy?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.
Did you learn anything?
Why the hell--?!
You talk to the wife.
How the hell do you know that?
Get the picture?
You need this for anything?
yes quite possibly.
Nothing's wrong.
I just want to get something straight.
What is wrong?
You do for each other.
Look you want to fit in here right?
You want to learn how to get along?
That is exactly so.
It is like your name...
Anyway what's it matter to you if we think it's funny right?
I am George.
What's that?
Get this straight in your head.
I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
and we work my hours.
Well this is it.
They took the stuff out all of it -- this afternoon.
I've seen this before.
Nothing I could do.
You know who it looks like?
He took the afternoon off.
Who else can I ask around here?
To be honest it's hard to say.
You know him?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Just a minute.
Yeah -- we met him.
close personal friend of George's here.
He and his wife have one child a son.
For you anything.
That's all I know.
You want anything more you ask somebody else.
Yeah I heard of it.
I seen him around.
What about the other one?
Did you know him?
Did he find anything?
What kind of test?
Yeah I'll bet.
That's the way these people are.
Lucky for you you got him in both of his...
I'll cover you!
Do you mind!
I got him.
Whatever gave you that idea?
How can I go?
Let's go...
let's go.
Would you Sir?
Pull 'em out.
Okay let's do it.
Fire-team A.
that's better.
Well thanks I --
They brought her here and you know it.
TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
HOW MUCH TIME?
See you soon.
Let's get on it.
What'll you need?
I'll go.
I'm afraid so.
And it's too late to shut it down?
That's it.
That is the question of the hour.
One for each person...
Now let me get this straight.
Now wait a second --
Set up for life.
They can bill me.
What's second?
Well I mean...
Now hold on a second.
It's the only way to be sure.
She's right.
That's not what I mean.
I hope you're right.
I really do.
That's the plan.
My word on it.
Not bring back.
The answer is no.
Now please go.
Just go would you.
Yes and I've read it.
If you go.
If I go.
And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
It's all I could get.
Days off are worse.
What about you?
What's your interest in this?
and now you want me to go back out there?
Hear me out...
There's no way!
You are a head case.
They think I'm a head case.
Just tell them what happened.
I get the picture.
Age:  sixty-six...
at time of death.
Two years ago.
are you all right?
But if it's not I want you there...
That's all.
How do you feel?
They're but off!
Just shut up!
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!
DO IT NOW!
Give it a rest would you.
You have to try...
where are your people?
One of us?
They have power.
Hold at forty.
I only work here.
We're not making that out too well.
But it looks like all of them.
He's coming in.
We're coming in.
Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.
Are there any questions?
What's the question?
Let's go!
Do you believe this?
We got problems.
Are you finished?
Well that's great!
That's just fucking great man.
We're in some real pretty shit now!
I believe it.
We have to --
They must have found another way in something we missed.
Get back here both of you.
It's game time.
We'd know about it.
Look you started this.
Now show me everything.
If it comes to that I'll do us both.
They'll get us.
They're probably looking for other ways to get in.
It's out.
On my way.
There's a fire door at this end.
About seventeen days.
They're in here.
Four more weeks and out.
They're right on us.
Just get back here!
What do you mean they cut the power?
How could they cut the power man?
They cut the power.
With those things running around.
Think of what?
Think of a way.
Think of something.
So what do I tell this guy?
Just a couple of days.
And how are we today?
I think we both can.
Right here baby.
I knew you'd come.
Come on we're almost there!
Open the door!
We're in trouble.
You mean dead.
A little girl.
Did you ever have a baby?
Why do they tell little kids that?
No real ones.
But there are.
Yeah you know.
I was the best at the game.
Look at me...
They're dead.
I know they would.
She's my only friend.
What are you talking about.
That will be...
Do you understand?
Look I told you...
Follow me please.
What did you think of the music?
How was I?
Well what does it matter to you?
Did you know?
Had you heard?
What does he look like?
I want to be in it.
Well do you know where it's set my dear?
Is there a part for me?
Is it true?
What else did he tell you today?
How do you like it?
No no no no.
This is his night.
No she's fine.
I have to get some water.
I thank you!
You have leave to try.
And how will you make him keep it?
But not again.
Oh sir yes!
I know my son.
He needs me and he needs you.
I will speak to you further when I come.
Why what sir?
Oh shut up.
And my horse.
Here he is.
I feel wrong.
I feel wrong being here.
I want to go!
Let me sit here.
Let me stay here with you.
Go back to bed.
Give me one reason I can understand.
Give me two more weeks.
Oh yes sir.
He's all right.
And he's working on it very hard.
I've been sick but I'm all right now.
I'm not telling you.
Who gave you this?
How much is it?
Who was that?
I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Half the house!
I want it here in my hand.
It was common.
We need money now.
I'm talking about now.
How much will you give him now?
Your father is dead.
It's over finished done with!
Yes my love?
We'll have a little party.
a very nice girl.
No it's right he should hear.
I'm sick to death of it.
Look old man you stay out of this.
And then you think you can -
She says she has to speak to you.
Well ask her!
What does she want?
There's a young girl to see you.
Who wants tea?
Let's go out!
I love you!
Tell them to go!
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go away.
Stop it now.
I've brought some friends to meet you.
They're next door waiting.
Do we have anything to eat?
All they want to see is your work.
You always know everything.
No they will not.
I know how things work in this city.
They'll come anyway.
They love me here.
We'd be set up for life!
Can we leave now?
Eat my - ah!
Just say it - you'll see.
It's very serious.
No this is serious.
No I'm not playing this game.
You're very sick.
Oh ha ha ha.
Yes I think it's brilliant.
You've been doing it for years.
Do you think that's funny?
That's stupid.
Tell them all.
Look I've stopped.
He asked me to stay here.
He asked me.
And I'm asking you -
He asked me to stay.
Just go please.
Well thank you very much.
You can go now.
I was at hand.
He took sick.
I brought him home.
Should we stay here?
Were they here earlier?
Where shall we go?
It's up to you.
If you want it for your husband come tonight.
Come back tonight.
Oh thank you sir!
One word from me and the post is his.
I have other things you might like.
I'm from a small town just like your husband.
Sir we really need this job.
It's just!
Give him just this one post.
This is my own idea.
Just leave them with me.
Would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now?
While I wait.
I will look at them of course the moment I can.
But why did he not come himself?
How can I help you?
Oh yes and who are you?
I'm paying people just to wait for you.
He's doing his best.
I'm paying these people.
Do you realize that?
Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's not in.
But he's working on it.
He said to tell you.
Where's our friend?
Not at all.
Ah  I see you've got your manager with you.
How much will you pay him?
Do you hear him?
So you are!
And what do you expect?
And so you do!
The only time you come out is to eat.
Well this is none of your business.
They love him here.
In three months!
When may I ask?
Do you know who I am?
Let us pass please!
Let us pass at once!
I said play!
I thought you must be an old man.
Play me something you know.
Who was your teacher?
Just one year.
Here she comes.
Well look at them.
Of course not.
There it is.
What is your view?
Well there it is.
Now to business.
I need a minute to practice.
May I try it?
May I see?
I want to meet this young man.
Do you know how much work went into it?
How about twenty?
Well six or seven minutes!
I have no idea.
Ah love again.
It's a piece about love.
When I do I have good reason.
Would you tell me why?
It is not your place to ask questions.
By all means.
It's quality work.
Of course I do.
It's very good.
So then you like it?
It is already here in my head.
It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Well what is it about?
Tell us the story.
Oh thank you.
No no please!
You know we have met already?
In this very room.
He's here.
Yes what about him?
Well what do you have for me today?
Very small pay I imagine.
I never saw this girl in my life.
Please play without me.
I'll do anything you say!
What better way could I spend it than on you?
That'll be fine.
I thought I did.
I'm sure I did.
Ah there she is!
Oh let's not talk about it.
This one will.
It's not important.
They get in the way.
Who says that?
It's wonderful.
People love me here.
That's not what I hear.
How is your financial situation?
Oh I mean no - not exactly like this.
She had to go - yes!
She had to help her mother.
Yes she's like that.
Do you always live like this?
Is she not here?
Just wait you'll see.
Why are you here?
Is he working?
You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father.
And his father's dead.
What has happened?
In there sir.
Where does he work?
I think I've found out about the money sir.
You're a good girl.
You're very kind to do this.
Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house let me know will you?
What is it he's writing?
Oh yes sir all day long.
Then how does he pay for all this?
Does he work at all?
Not that I've seen.
Oh thank you sir.
Yes thank you sir.
I will sir.
What have you got for me today?
Let me see.
Good morning sir.
I can live in or out just as you wish.
So let me see it.
Well we can.
Can I see it?
I'm sorry!
Is it finished?
Put it down I said!
It's nothing for you.
Put it down!
So there you are.
No no I love that.
What else do you think they speak here?
You'd have to use those.
I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
What did he say?
What can I do for you?
Well I'm a good teacher.
on the whole.
Say good morning.
Of course it's him.
Who do you think it is?
I'm afraid I am.
She's my wife.
That's funny - I like it.
Which one eh?
Come this way.
I thought you did not care for my work - or me.
Shall we try?
We'll stop for just a moment.
Then let me hear it.
All of it.
The whole thing from the beginning - now!
Do you have it?
And that's it.
Yes yes - go on.
That's wonderful!
Do you have me?
Now for the Fire.
And that's all?
Just one moment.
Do you have that?
Do you believe in it?
Where did I stop?
Then let us try together.
Tell me what is this work?
You know it's all here in my head.
It's just ready to be set down.
I'm not allowed.
Actually you could.
Can I - could I help you in any way?
But that's too soon!
Did he say a hundred?
Ask him if he'd give me some money now.
Tell him if he would that would help me finish it.
No it's him!
Shall I answer it?
I'm too young to be so sick.
The doctor thinks I am.
Then I drink too much and think stupid things.
Do you mean that?
I would never miss anything that you had written.
You must know that.
You're so good to me.
You mean she's not coming back?
She's not well either.
Where is your wife?
I have to get back.
I'm taking you home.
You're not well.
Is it over?
It's not finished.
I'm sorry but I need more time.
And be sure to tell no one what you do.
You will see me again soon.
How long will you give me?
Do you accept?
You will be paid well.
Who is dead?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Did my work please you?
How could I not?
It was good of you to come.
I know I know.
What did you think of it yourself?
Did you like it at all?
But there are those who have power over him.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
My wife took it out in time.
He's obviously no friend of yours.
Will that do?
What exactly are you working on?
I'd better not.
Tell me more.
I'm being silly.
Only for six months eight at most.
I'll pay you back double.
Name your terms.
I'm afraid not.
How is that possible?
How can anyone say that?
Nothing at all!
I need this post.
Here is the music.
It's here.
So you see this post is very important to me right now.
She is well.
She is - well actually I'm about to become a father!
She only told me last night.
You are the first to know.
So you are.
How is your pretty wife?
Here they are.
Did you like it then?
Oh yes certainly.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Well not especially.
I think you'd better.
Have I seen it?
I tell you straight: I will not!
Look young man the issue is simple.
They hate my music.
Who is on this committee?
No but I'm the best.
What is what?
What does that mean?
I'm stupid.
No one can understand a word.
Really quite fine.
Oh my son my poor son!
What difference does that make?
But not his body.
How does one do that?
It's very different when you have to do it with your own hands.
Oh yes yes yes yes yes!
As you should.
I thought you did so every day.
So speak now.
My son no one can speak for God.
Tell me that.
Go on tell me!
Speak for Him!
God's ways are not yours.
And you are not here to question Him.
That is all you need to know.
What did it matter?
And I was nothing to God.
Did you try?
What was God up to?
That was very possible.
All the same why him?
Do you hear me?
Do you believe it?
And do they believe it?
Ah - you've heard that?
You know who that is?
Oh I know that!
What about this little thing?
I wrote it.
How about this?
Then you must know this.
I know a little.
I'm here only for you.
Please talk to me.
That makes no difference.
You never heard of me did you?
You tried to take your life.
I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Yes in the third act.
Are you absolutely sure?
You mean that play?
Oh yes yes.
And that was?
Of course now.
Right away before I get any older.
What do you mean - now?
Well thank you!
I heard your wish.
A very appropriate person to do so.
I've done my best.
It has to stop.
Come with me.
And stay in the room.
What does he want?
Show her in.
Then go to bed.
That lady is back sir.
Oh by the way give him this.
I'll call tomorrow.
We should let him rest.
But he's all right?
Can we come in?
Yes I am looking after him.
Do you think he'll eat the food?
How did he look?
But it's something to do.
Tea would be nice.
What shall we do?
Shall I send a car?
We'll come right over.
I want you to bring David here.
I want him in my care.
Yes I should think so.
Could you get here without any trouble?
No not really.
Yes he is.
Is he all right?
Where was he?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
And what else?
Is this more serious than I know?
He's not?
I'm concerned about David.
Come to my office Miss Price.
Yes Doctor I have.
Yes I believe he did.
Of course sir.
Good day Doctor.
What happened to them?
What exactly did he call out?
Oh Miss Price?
Can I be of service Miss Price?
Get away from me!
I've got to get away from here!
I've got to do something!
David let's go now.
Will you shut up!?!!
We had an argument.
He's being silly.
David what are you doing?
Having no clothes on?
But you know what?
Where on earth have you been!?!
Yeah I do but go to work.
David do you want me to stay here tonight?
Let me go now you'll make me late.
Do you really?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
It's nice to see you.
There is only one bed.
Yeah I would think so too.
I would think so.
What do I think?
Will you be all right?
Are you better now?
Will you think about it?
Now David I said I would keep you company but I meant right here and now.
Will you come with me?
That's easy enough.
Just keep me company for a while.
Can I get you something?
Yes go on.
Oh yes please.
Shall I read to you?
My best friend.
My very best friend.
Now what do you want to talk about?
I'm twenty-seven.
That's not really a very proper question.
I want to talk to you.
I've just started it.
My friend gave it to me.
Do you like it?
You're a very beautiful girl.
Will you give me a break?
Call me David.
I'll take them later.
How is that?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I thought not.
The doctor will be round later.
Would you like a picture book to look at?
Well all right then be that way.
Why on earth do you say that?
He's an American you know.
Yes I should think.
He called out just now.
He all right?
I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Take these round now will you please?
Will you be sure of that?
Who is this girl?
Now see here young man.
There's no call for that kind of language.
All right you two move along.
You did did you?
Why are you doing this to me?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
You could have told them!
No one brought them here!
No one wanted them here!
That's very funny that is.
Oh all right.
You've had your chance.
Oh come on tell us.
No but we're about to.
Some everyone does.
It's nearly eight.
What time is it?
Of course not David.
I'd rather not be by myself.
I saw him.
But never so real.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
So they said.
Miss Price will see to your needs.
How long have I been here?
Get your fucking hands off me!
Miss Price please!
The guy I was with.
How did I get to London?
You're in a hospital in London.
Where am I?
I could hang myself.
How shall I do it?
I want you to meet some people.
I will not accept this!
Now go away!
I'm not having a nice time David!
You must take your own life!
You must believe me.
I think I've lost my mind.
I think you're not real.
You must take your own life now David before it's too late.
You'll change you'll become...
I understand all right.
Okay you've seen me.
Now go away.
I wanted to see you.
You're not real.
It's all true.
Take your own life!
Take your own life David.
It's our only chance.
David please believe me.
Please go away.
You've got two days.
It's you David.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not listening!
You've got to know.
So you know what she does?
This is too much.
Thanks a lot.
Nice to see you.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Not far enough.
It sounds far away.
Walking away yes sir.
Here we are walking away.
Do you think it's a dog?
It's in front of us.
Let's just keep walking.
What's the plan?
It's moving.
I think we should just keep moving.
Come on where?
David what is that?
Could be a lot of things.
What was it?
Did you hear that?
What do you think was wrong?
What the hell was that all about?
You ask them.
Go on ask them.
What about it?
Look at that.
Nice looking group.
I have to make love to her.
It's very simple.
She has no choice really.
Well anyway do you think she'll be there?
You're talking about the woman I love.
Well I like it here.
I mean look around.
You're not having a good time are you?
Are you cold?
You were saying?
No thank you Doctor.
Come in come in.
Tell him I'm out.
Tell him I'm dead.
He's on the telephone.
Send them in.
Oh that's been there for two hundred years.
What can I get you?
Then you have some hot tea?
If it's something hot you want you can have tea.
We'll find him not to worry.
We will find him however.
I'd like some tea please.
I'll tell you why.
I want to know why.
What do you suppose anybody wants?
Money money money!
You here again?
I was the first one to see it.
And me with a date too.
Where do you think I've been?
Where you been?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will.
Give a guy a break will you?
I've got to get it back in my account.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
It was more than that last week.
About twenty-four thousand.
When he comes in tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Not yet Mr.
All right let him!
If he wants to run the bank let him do it.
What good will that do?
Why it will take control away from him.
That's what good it will do!
Oh is he?
You know what you can do with that!
Come on take a look at this!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
Do anything you want with it.
You just wait and see.
You know what that means?
So that's it eh?
Now you want our help.
There's one way you can get it.
You thought they were your friends.
I have everything I own in it.
Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
What do you mean help?
You've all made money out of it.
We want to talk to you.
That's the only thing that means anything to me.
I'm running this bank my way.
Get that clear!
That's all very well.
That's your idea?
What's the matter with my policy?
I'll tell you.
Not a single one!
Oh you would eh?
What's on your mind?
I think Mr.
I had nothing to do with that I tell you!
I went there to get them back.
Why of course.
What was the lady's name Mr.
Oh yes of course.
There was someone with me.
That's very simple.
I was home.
Of course yes.
Get out get out!
She just came up for a drink.
Just for a few minutes.
You just mentioned her name.
What was she doing there?
Nothing nothing Mr.
I lost my head completely!
I'm not afraid of you.
And now fair woman I have you in my power.
What is that Mr.
I never thought I would find myself in that class.
I know the answer to that one.
I think you'd better take me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes.
We'll have just one drink then we'll go.
You told me you were taking me home.
Now wait a minute wait a minute...
I want to be near you!
Not when you are there.
Please ask me.
No can do.
It's all set.
I've been planning it for months.
I must see you tonight!
Yes yes it does.
Now let me see what comes next?
Not bad not bad at all.
Do you know something?
Not your work.
Here here here now!
Well you can.
You always could.
What is the matter with you?
Why I needed a
Not during business hours.
That will be just about enough!
Now get out of here!
This is my business.
You'd do well to mind your own business.
Then maybe you'll understand Mrs.
Nobody knows it better than you.
You've no right to do this to her Mr.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Oh no Mr.
It's about you and Mrs.
Anything you have to say to me you can say in the morning.
Well I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I told him it was important.
Well that's too bad.
Mine's all right too.
Good morning Mr.
My wife is much better this morning.
Of course let them in!
You're late now.
Shall we let the people come in?
I feel all right too.
How do you feel this morning?
Much better this morning thank you.
John how's your wife this morning?
Well dear you see I.
I want to ask you something.
I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you but.
Where were you last night?
You can take some of the girls.
But I have to go dear.
That's all there is to it.
I'm so sorry dear.
What's the matter dear?
What have I done now?
What a man what a man!
Well look who's here!
It's not for you.
Say I know what's the matter with you.
No never mind.
You want the rest of those numbers Mr.
Bring your book.
I want some numbers to try to get some action.
Just as quick as you can.
Where is he now?
They think he did it!
Why - well I
Send him in.
He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty.
I only want ten thousand.
Yes thank you.
Got my letter?
Good morning Mrs.
How much did it cost?
Tell him I sent you.
How much does one cost?
I want you both to take the day off.
Do you know?
Answer my question.
You've got more friends than anybody in this town.
All you've got to do is
Oh I can explain about that later.
You're not giving up are you Mr.
We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Now come on tell me.
No I'm not Mr.
It's serious son.
But we've got to make them believe it.
There you are.
I already told him I was home.
That's all I wanted.
I think it's great.
Only well you've done so much for me already.
I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Say come on.
Are you sick or something?
Not a bad thought eh?
It's all right.
What's she got to do with you?
I've known this man for years.
You were right Mr.
Here's your man.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
So have you.
So have I.
So's everybody got a record.
He had no more to do with it than you did.
You've got nothing to worry about.
That's what he says.
Why certainly he can.
If he can do it yes.
What time did this thing happen?
Why pick on him?
I'm afraid I must Mr.
Take them out and get them changed.
Tell them to take their time.
I'll talk to them.
What'll we do?
If they only knew it they're making things worse for themselves.
Look at them Mr.
I have called for some extra police.
He's too busy running around.
That's just exactly what he has been doing.
Tell him to keep tomorrow open.
I'll take this along with me.
Everything will be all right.
It's his life insurance money.
It's his life insurance money you know.
When he comes out you tell him I'll be back.
Oh that means hours I suppose.
He's at a board meeting.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
How-do-you-do Mrs.
There's Mr.
You've got to come through for him Mr.
He came through for you a hundred times.
The run's getting worse.
I got an idea.
Come on let's get to a telephone.
Sure they'd turn him down.
He ought to know that.
They must have turned him down.
Something's happened.
Is he getting any help?
All right dear.
I'll wait for you upstairs.
Can you imagine that guy?
No not yet.
I tell you I saw them!
Well he was making love to her.
Did you get the job?
What did you do with it?
Oh is that so?
Hey look out somebody's likely to see us!
Are you sure?
He came to see Mr.
He was here?
He was in the bank yesterday.
Never mind all that.
What did you find out?
That's all Mrs.
There you are!
That's just what I'm trying to tell you sir.
What time was it?
It was late I know.
They work at a show you know.
What time was it Mrs.
Sure I do.
He has the best room in me house.
Do you know this young man Mrs.
Then where were you?
Are you sure it was that?
What time did you get in?
So you were home last night?
Then who changed it?
They're starting to come in already.
Yeah what did he do with his first one?
You've got enough?
You better turn some in tonight.
Now you tell us.
He's not bad at it.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
What have you done?
How'd they --
It's still taking too long.
We got a problem here brother?
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
That was two hours ago.
Never a good thing.
Then I love it.
I can hit those boys from here.
He's planning a job.
You are a fine figure of a man.
This is about the ""Wanted!
You explain it to him.
We go home.
You shut up now boy.
Who's next?
I'm out.
We'll make them pay for this.
We hit this bank.
I got us through the War all right.
A bad idea.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
I know this town and I know this bank and I say it's an easy job.
If you'd read about it first you'd have no problems.
What will be?
It's better.
That way we can take on a bigger job.
It's not a bank.
I got three.
I got seven thousand.
I'll pick the first job!
I know a girl down at the bank.
Just like in the war.
They've got more men than we do.
Hell we were great at it.
Why should we miss that?
There are things I miss about it.
Thanks for the help.
She was European!
She got two of them.
What is wrong with you?
Year after year.
Lot's of 'em.
I could use the walk.
I'm thinking...
Figure we might have some work for you if you want.
There they are.
They're just insurance in case we run.
We decide something that's it!
We've got to think --
Come back here and face me!
He's European.
Which one right or left?
Both would be nice.
All right all right.
I'll just wait here.
You're right sir.
From back there.
Where the hell were you?
Some place near.
What do you say sir?
He thinks this is some kind of game!
We should know in the morning.
They're gone.
What are you --
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
What the hell were we thinking?
How was he supposed to say no to that?
Jim was old enough...
Got any ideas little brother?
Maybe it started out that way.
You need it now.
And we're good at it.
This has been a good year.
Two of you went into that bank together right?
How'd it go out here?
How'd it go in there?
Make a thousand of 'em.
We could move on.
Heard of him.
She's still talking to Jesus.
You can shut up now.
""Big and older""?
That just might work.
Think about this.
If we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right.
All we thought about was coming home.
You're doing just fine.
Hell of a war.
So we got a plan?
How much of that story is true?
So what was he?
That he was.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
every time you tell that story you stop there.
Take care of each other boys.
We're just fine thank you sir.
Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
I'll explain on the way.
You are a hell of a woman.
Oh I'm not finished.
""  As I said.
Let me see that.
Now wait a minute.
I've got you.
You keep me busy.
then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
That's why I picked it.
We can start a whole new life down here.
She's beautiful.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world.
I had to see you.
What are you thinking?
Yours or God's?
When will you stop?
Let the law --
You and I we've started...
something you know?
Where will you find such a girl?
And what's this right girl like?
Not if I find the right girl.
I mean of course not.
You're sick of my company?
I've been on my back two weeks.
I'm sick of it.
We want to help.
But still died.
But you got big!
He's too important James.
You and your wife.
Now this is for everybody else.
No I'll hang you.
That's what I would have done.
Was it worth it?
That's nice to know.
No that one was close.
Not that day.
That's the idea.
Oh it's a similar room.
We're moving you tomorrow.
Right here in church?
Now let's have a drink.
I just want you to know I'm trying to start a new life here.
My girl you know from that time...
It's his money.
You do that.
Tell you something else.
They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.
I been with...
You been with a girl ever?
Well not exactly.
Jim you been with a girl yet?
Now it's my turn.
I like that.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
And you're too young.
Could we go upstairs and talk?
Buy you a drink?
Thank you Miss --?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Yes but just so I could find out who you were.
There's only four of them...
How can that be?
How did you know?
I remember you.
This is him.
I look forward to seeing it.
With my money!
THEN WHO DID?!
Thirty-five thousand sir.
Can you put men at all four?
So he's won.
They are not the same thing.
First of all: you shut up.
It's been eight months.
All these were in the War.
It's early in the game yet Mr.
Oh that's the best part.
""  Who wrote this!?
It is a nice piece of writing.
This is no game.
I think not.
We're beginning an interesting game here Mr.
Oh no I would have done that.
There's nothing to say.
Next week no Less.
Can we talk?
What are you doing tonight?
Oh God just get it over with.
Well it's not a turn-on for me.
Take it off.
Turn on the Light.
Turn the light on.
Is it a what?
Get off me.
"" You'll love it.
Are we here?
I just want to have a child.
Sounds like I'll have to.
Pick me up?
I have to go.
I need to be home for that.
You should come have dinner with me.
He said he'd call tonight.
What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Oh I'm...
Listen what are you doing tonight?
It's not that nice.
So you're looking great how have you been?
You have a really nice place here...
How much did you pay for it?
I'm not supposed to.
No no no.
But what about the past?
I know that your friends are my friends.
I've thought about that.
You can have them.
But your friends are my friends.
My friends are your friends.
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over.
Now are we having coffee?
It's all over
What is there to talk about?
We need to talk.
It's not.
Why should I?
Everybody has a great body now.
He has a great body
He's good-looking.
Well you hate that job anyway.
You can do anything you like silly.
We should do it.
""What about fucking dinner?
Listen what about dinner?
He was an interesting guy.
Thanks guy but...
I know her.
I knew her.
I'm the best looking.
I suggest you go.
But I think...
I want to know what happened here.
I think you should go now.
I mean yes I did.
In the Times.
I'm looking for...
Can I help you?
just ten days ago.
It's just not.
It never was supposed to he!
But that's simply not possible.
I talk to you on the phone all the time!
what was it you said he did to her?
Now let's have lunch or dinner or something.
You're still seeing her right?
What exactly do you mean?
It's not me.
Is that you?
Ask me a question.
Oh come on.
Let's do it anyway
Oh my God...
Maybe it's just the light.
Oh who knows?
Has he stopped working out?
Two at nine?
That's great.
Follow me Mr.
For two at eight?
to the office this afternoon.
What are I doing?
You're right I should go.
If you stay I think something bad will happen.
I know I should go.
I mean do you want me to go?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
need it for...
Had you heard this?
I mean in your life?
Are you seeing anyone?
You look great.
But thank you.
I'd love some.
They know me.
No we'll go anywhere you want.
Where do you want to go?
Anywhere you want.
Just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.
No come on.
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want.
Anywhere you want?
if you're not doing anything.
Can you bring Mr...
It's only ten-thirty.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
You look nice today.
I'll make them.
Just say no?
And what should I say?
that's too bad.
it depends why?
What do you think I do?
So what do you do?
Listen I've really got to go.
I'll-Oh...
I'll call you.
Well what about oh you know maybe a Saturday?
I'm at work all the time.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week?
Yeah well oh boy listen I've got to go.
I'm really late.
Oh I get it.
You know like...
I mean can you talk to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.
Coming all the way up here but you know.
They really are the best.
I thought that was you.
More than one?
Why do you think I'd be into that?
Does he do this all the time?
I think it would be a turn-on.
Listen I would just like to see...
the two of you...
get it on.
Was he a friend of yours?
It's me.
I need your services.
I'm at-
Why would I?
She's from...
She's my...
What do you do?
What do you mean she was a hot number.
Maybe he did go to London.
So who was he with?
Where do you place Paul that night?
I'm not really sure.
I'm just...
I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I'll be there.
Well to each his own.
So-lunch Thursday?
No I like music.
I'm with you on that one.
Great yes I'd like that.
Well thank you Mr.
and that's about it.
Well I could he wrong.
That you were with-
That's not what I've got.
Like I said you need anything at all I'm your man.
you hang out here a lot?
There's one...
As I said we're not sure.
basically no one has seen or heard anything.
has anyone seen him in London?
So was I.
I just wanted to know if you know.
Listen I just...
I just want to help.
And where did he go to school?
Let me think.
Where did Paul hang out?
Do you feel that way?
What kind of man was he?
the information you've just given.
What do you mean...
He was part of that whole...
How well did you know him?
Who do you ask?
Pardon me but are you okay?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street.
Where did you go to school?
It's no problem
Oh no I'm okay.
No I'm okay.
Ah I see...
Nothing like that.
well you're here so...
Nice to meet you.
No I'm sorry.
Was that anything important?
Listen John I've got to go.
Okay John right got it.
Sorry about that.
Do you know that?
I'm so cold.
it's okay.
You're kind.
You're a kind man.
I can tell.
You've got to get your act together.
I'll help you.
Listen what's your name?
Listen do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs?
From people who do work?
I know that I know that.
I'm trying to help you.
You're not what?
I'm not...
Is that why you lost it?
I lost my job...
Do you have a dog?
They're okay.
Two-hundred-and-fifty.
Where is she tonight?
How did you get it?
Yeah well you're late.
I'm very lucky.
She's a great girl.
Oh well you know.
That's interesting.
I've been great.
How the hell are you?
He looks so...
He seems so...
out of it.
How can he pull that shit?
You think so?
If he wants to go up there?
To check it out?
It's his life.
I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
You know what he's like.
You know what I mean.
You're just afraid to eat it.
Here we go.
You look beautiful.
Look at me!
Just shut up?
To tell her how I feel about you.
You know I --
Just to hold it again.
He's never even met you.
Where were you?
That was -- different.
You know that's not true.
It's what they said it is.
You were right...
What did you see in there?
So you believe me?
I know how to get in there.
Is it two?
Or is it three?
And how can you get in there anyway?
Even if all this were true.
How should I know?
Why would he --
I think we should just go.
Nobody does work like this on-line.
They'd have to be like watching people.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death?
What're you -- what?
He's not your --
That's what I'm asking myself.
What would it mean anyway?
It's the way he said it.
I said ""Did you really do this just today?
That's what I need to ask you.
To our new life.
We'll leave it for him?
That's why you have to help me decide.
And he was moving us all over the place?
Or your dad.
It's important.
Three of four times.
I think I kind of lost it.
We've got our eyes on her.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Not like him is it?
To do a thing like that without telling you.
You're happy there?
Let me look into it see what's being done.
But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
I am sir.
What seems to be the problem?
Thank you for seeing me.
I need to talk to you.
What's that mean again?
I'm here as a friend.
When did you know?
Let's do number five?
What'd they ever do for you?
Sure I'll see what I can do.
Can you help me?
You're living here?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this.
We could move 'em up here.
I do know.
You feel you've lost control.
I'm pretty close.
I feel the same way.
I thought I was coming here for a job.
But it's meant a lot more.
I hope you know what you mean to me.
Oh that's right.
That's great!
What would you tell the kids?
At your new school?
You had to come up with a good story right?
He could read"" people so chance had nothing to do with it.
Off we'd go again.
Why did you move around so much?
The answer's not in the box.
The wrong place?
And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
But they're real short lines.
You've been coming in early.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Talk about work?
I heard what happened.
You really wrote this just today?
Well -- you sent for me.
You're making me young again.
Take a look at this.
That's what I told her.
I look at you and see the things that got me here.
But this is all you'd be working on.
There is no second...
Now what would you like to ask me?
When would we come?
I'd love to show them to you.
Ready for number three?
Just do what I'm asking!
I want him to like me.
What'd the girl say?
Maybe we should all get on it.
This is good.
Who did it?
We'll come up with the next big thing.
"" Know what it means?
Just thought his work should go on.
I know you lost all his work.
Maybe I could come down here and --
I mean it's your life.
I think you should go.
All the companies know.
Now what are we doing?
So we'll get the evidence first ask questions later.
Let's get him in here.
What're we looking for?
Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Wait a second.
He knows I know.
But you said the other --
It's three years old it --
They know I had no choice.
Get out of the house now!
We have to go in tonight.
Does he know you know?
You'll come up with something.
But even then I was starting to wonder.
You turn into -- into --"
You mean -- break in?
How long would that take you?
But they'd still get the idea right?
Let's use it.
How close are you?
Or all of 'em.
Or the guy she works for?
Certainly not at my happy home.
Not even at home.
Have to be careful who we pick.
We tell the wrong person it's over.
They're already watching you.
I know what he did to you.
There is no second place.
"" I mean they're in the information business.
In case we find out too much.
But why would they --?
He was almost there.
The Day Care?
You thought about it too.
But it's not happening in there.
It's happening in the Day Care.
Why would you do a thing like --
Then and now.
But not right now.
Was that then?
Not that interesting.
Why's that?
""There is no second place.
What've you got there?
No I know what you mean.
Like a person would.
You can go back and make it all work.
Did I say something?
Some of us who got to good at this?
You know mine.
You know my name.
I keep thinking it'll go away.
She's -- beautiful.
Is it serious?
I met this girl.
You know what's the bad part?
A million-five!
What're they building?
You'll be working with her.
So how'd you like the house?
Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Speaking of which...
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Go out the way you came in?
We're too late.
You're not listening.
I could get it out of him.
There's nothing in this hall.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
To my health.
Thank you that's beautiful.
To your health.
How do you feel Mr.
Or sometimes not at all.
Come in and I'll show you everything you need to know.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
We can talk about business later.
What do you want Mr...
Hey how are you?
But wait I-- you got me again.
Ring him up he'll look after you.
Not quite actually.
You're talking about my mother!
That's not your mother that's a man!
If we could get back to the business at hand.
What's the other?
That's the first place you should look.
You mean Mrs.
Good on ya!
The cold war's over.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Let's go baby!
Just where you'd never think to look for him.
We'll be there.
Good on ya man.
It's a question.
Let me ask you this.
What is love?
Good afternoon Mr.
See what I care.
Well done Mr.
We're not so different you and I.
Oh forget it.
It's a little late for that.
What's wrong with your hand?
I have something to tell you.
I can explain.
Gas came out of her...
well and then they...
We're a team.
You go get help.
What do we do now?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Give it to me.
All right I get it.
I always keep this on me just in case.
Just watch me.
Watch me now.
You know who.
I'll tell him.
You're everything to me.
Well it means something to me.
Look at her hands baby!
She was so in love with your Dad.
Oh yes you are.
I am not.
Move your hand to the left.
Watch out you're on my hair!
I hate having my picture taken.
Well you know...
Let me tell you a story.
Let's go get him!
Do you want to talk to him?
Why did you leave so soon?
Here use mine.
Hey who put this in here?
I understand that Mr.
I'm sorry?
Just to get things moving baby.
My mother's doing quite well thank you very much.
How's your mum?
My mother's told me all about you.
I'm telling you baby that's not mine.
That's not mine.
No no I want you to have it even if it's my last piece.
Hey wait a minute--
Everything seems to be in order.
What's its current position?
Oh my God he's back.
What are you saying son?
Is it one of ours?
Hello up there!
Some of you I know some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Someone help me!
We've got a lot of work to do.
And look what you've done to Mr.
What do we have?
We tried to get some but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Yes what is it?
That's not true Doctor.
You're here that's what's important.
No the boy's right.
That was great Mr.
I hate you!
They'll get away!
I have a better idea.
What are you waiting for?
And that's how you want to live your life is it?
Thought I'd stay in.
How was your day?
You always do that!
I have a son!
Everyone I have a son!
All right then...
Oh hell let's just do what we always do.
Here's the plan.
People have to tell me these things.
Here's my second plan.
I'm on with a friend!
Look I'd better go.
No it's been too long.
Women want him men want to be him.
Did you ever want to?
Did you ever...
He's very much a product of his times.
In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
And how do you feel about that?
Well I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago.
He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
I'll call again.
Leave us your number.
As real as you wish.
Hot or cold.
Anything you like.
How real does it feel?
By a friend.
We're not yet open for business I'm afraid.
Would that I could say the Same.
So I'm still...
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words.
Do you understand...
I'll tell you everything...
The weather's getting worse and worse...
they're after me...
coming for me...
Have we met?
Good Lord no.
I so agree.
As you see.
You and I.
Who could that be Mrs.
We have met...
it could have been you.
To us all...
For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
We want to help...!
What are you trying to do to me?
After the cold war...
If you can control the weather you control the world.
My number two.
You'll always be Mrs.
One very small thing.
I want you.
But also your ring.
The result would be...
Let me show you --
That's better.
Now what have I left out?
Oh yes I know: the ring.
It was all for you...
But I found you.
I'll send Mother...
As a matter of fact I have...
Have you any place in mind?
A fine night Mrs.
What kept you?
I might as well.
I'll be back...
Have a look at this.
Father's looking for you.
' I might have known.
Here have one of these.
I'm just now --
You'll find out.
I'm a wanted woman I know...
We'd better be careful.
Not to speak of.
There was nobody.
No idea who.
No idea why...
Any idea who?
But you're not their big worry at present.
I told Mother I took care of you.
No after you.
After you -- Mrs.
I'm playing to win.
Not for a moment.
what are you doing?
It comes down to one thing Mrs.
I could save you the trouble.
It was Peter -- I saw him...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out...
I thought you were someone else...
Just my type Mrs.
Is that what you think?
Not that I know of.
And by you Mrs.
Everything points to you.
That's what we were working on.
This is my field.
Here's a bus...
For you Mrs.
What on earth?
How on earth can you tell?
But he must know.
Did he say who?
That's possible.
But I'd never met him.
Another odd thing.
You told them.
Left you for dead.
Why should they think that?
I might say the same.
You were very lucky.
Mother brought you here.
Not me you should thank.
You should be dead.
Try the weather.
All of a piece really.
He has a wife called June.
I meant me.
I have no choice.
For a man in my position --
why are we seeing him first?
This is part of mine.
What's the point?
This car -- and you.
Do you really think so?
I thought we were on our way.
My father always wanted a boy.
We're not here to talk about the weather surely.
And just what is the game?
Not by me.
Whereas you are.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us.
Where's Mother?
You're saying I have no choice.
Very good Mrs.
Getting to what?
I was getting to it.
Makes two of us.
I know all this.
Now let's see...
Peter's brother?
Ah here we are.
How can I help you Mrs.
Well you found me.
Dead I'm afraid.
We want Mrs.
So you say...
We know one thing.
If I'm right Mrs.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble my son.
Mother and Father know best.
He had to be certain.
Her husband she says.
Tell Father That's all.
This man -- did you see him?
Too late anyway.
Anyone particular in mind?
Something went wrong.
Darling is right you should watch out.
She may not know.
Oh yes I did.
I want you to meet somebody.
I expect you'll like her.
You with Mother or Father?
Mother said you'd be on your way.
I feel sure of it.
I think so thank you so much...
Are you alright young man?
Stay by the window.
By the window.
Walk over to the window...
Where's Mrs.
You are and it's behind you.
If you say so.
you're dead.
The last one you'll ever see.
Look at that guy.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Right in here.
The big show starts in one minute.
I took care of 'em.
it's my decision.
I'm good at it.
Where's the women man?
All the things that make life worth living.
This is it...
I've decided not to run for President.
I'll go with you.
Move that car will you?
When do the girls get to the party?
She's mine!
You've had it.
She'll always be.
Maybe it had something to do.
Shit shit shit shit.
My car's gone!
I mean it.
The car is yours.
I'm very happy for you two.
I love that car.
See that down there?
Ooh be still my heart.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Oh come on just a little.
We'll all keep that in mind.
He'll never be true to you the way I would.
What is this person's story here?
Seventy-five hundred.
Not so good.
Yes I did.
All right I'll go up there and take care of this myself.
You look awful son.
Go find yourself some clothes.
Take hold of yourself.
What room are they in?
Shut up I'm talking here.
Hey shut up.
So he's playing hard ball.
Well two can play that game.
Go after him.
Stop at nothing.
You hear me?
If it were me I'd reason with him first.
But how can I do that?
It's not her mind you need to change.
I've tried to change her mind.
Yes sir I am.
Thank you sir.
Am I late?
Do it for me.
Be oh so very very happy.
I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Then why are you coming back to me?
God wants the two of you to be together and sure enough...
I've got to tell you...
We'll forget what happened.
This has been quite a night.
Here's a thought.
Are you okay?
You're on.
Now what do you want to do about it?
You're what I want.
I want to be with you.
Let go of me!
Have a good time.
Your mother's not dead.
Sorry we got men's business to do.
It's no place for a lady.
This is it lady.
I need to talk.
I got something for that.
Why do you ask?
I'm not talking about does.
Does stay home.
Not in this case however.
It looks awful.
Well what do you think?
Want to hear something great?
it's supposed to do this.
What are we having?
I know what I'm doing...
Look girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off.
The rest of you break for it!
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Of course you do.
What kind of job?
hope she'll be very happy.
I better call my service...
tell them where I am.
That's more like it.
Give him the works.
You want girls.
I'll give you girls.
I was planning to do a lot of business with you.
How much money you got?
Nice to meet you both.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Let's see your bread.
It's true.
Give the guy air.
I always will.
What can I tell you?
tell it like it is.
We're all here.
Big problem now.
I'll take some.
That I got.
Very good women.
They sit on your face anything you want.
I want women.
What can I be doing for you?
I love my friends.
I hate her.
Just in love with everybody.
I love everybody.
Personal things you know.
We brought back a friend.
Ha ha ha.
Just go out there.
What the hell are you doing?
I see you're right.
I want to end everything here...
Be good for you.
What do you mean it changes?
It's over.
You sure you want to go through with it man?
I see what you mean...
You're a beautiful guy.
What do you know they moved it.
We're looking for our room...
Are you looking for someone?
Are any of those right?
Let me finish.
She can do what she wants.
I'd love that.
Really a beautiful experience.
It's all right...
The phone made me do it!
You can tell a man by his friends.
In a second...
perhaps we ought to stop now.
Then there is a God.
How are we doing?
And you are...?
You got it.
Let's party!
I'll stop him...
What can I do?
I'm dead.
Who's your friend?
How'd it go?
She wants to meet you.
So long Father.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
The best table in the house.
Under the table!
What the hell is that?
Let's go get something to eat.
We'll bring back food for everybody.
Then it's on to the real thing.
Where the hell is he?
Where'd she go?
Well the first month it's great.
Look you're my older brother.
I need some advice here.
What can I expect?
Thanks a lot that was the best.
You're next.
Give me the will to live.
Let me go first.
Let's give him a break.
I need the action.
That's an even trade...
God I miss that.
Think it over.
you're late enough as it is.
I'm in the book.
You're absolutely right.
Maybe I did...
There's a fire.
We've got a job here.
Let's get on with it.
Talk to me.
They were my friends I had to do it.
I had to do it for the department.
Just do your fucking job!
-- What the hell's the matter with you?
You always check the other side.
We got a job here.
Not with this one.
I need a drink.
-- What he would do to your dad's department?
Just come down John.
Jesus Christ why did you have to go in there so fucking early?
John when you're in there...
in the fire...
do you ever see...
on the job.
might have something to say about that.
You did okay.
I'm sorry I thought...
He's my responsibility.
-- What were they doing there?
Looking for me.
I put it there!
-- What are you doing here?
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Maybe I do.
You think he could have heard you in there?
I saw it before it got them.
He asked me to look out for him.
When dad died I saw another fire...
I'm your brother not your father.
Jesus Christ dad was gone what was I supposed to do?
What have you got to do?
Look at you.
Look at your face.
All the things you must be thinking.
Well you know what?
I really should get back.
there's something I'm supposed to do.
And I got way too many of them...
I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Just wanted to say hello...
Hey what are you doing here?
He was your responsibility.
I had that fire.
Is that what happened?
What did you learn today?
Time to move on?
Dad's way?
Where did he tell you that?
And what if there'd been two?
It's my way.
It's dad's way.
Not one for the company and one for me.
Christ I'll let you win next time.
It's just sometimes...
Get that right.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
You know what it felt like.
So that's it?
And that's not fucking good enough.
People actually used to pay you for this?
What you've never seen one before?
I like what you've done with the place.
Well see you're wrong already.
See ya around little brother.
Well look what we have here.
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire.
Who asked you?
It's a small town.
What'll you do?
Just take it.
I run that office now.
You want me to just throw that away?
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
You could check.
We still talking?
Look I'm sorry about the other day --
You knew what we were asking you to do.
-- I work for the city.
I was there remember?
I saw you and your brother --
And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?
I was doing my job.
All for a couple's political points.
It's all over the fucking news.
I wanted to be a good one.
Do you miss it?
You seem like you do.
It was pretty different then...
Got anything to drink in there?
Jesus give him a break.
But I wanted you to come to.
You think that's really any of your business?
Boy you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Well maybe I can fit it in...
I could use a date.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night...
Think about your future for once.
How can you work for that guy?
Let me tell you something.
I'm working here.
When I was twenty.
Well if nothing else it's nice to know we can still be friends.
I work for city hall.
What have you been up to?
You're back.
Oh Jesus Christ...
After it took your dad...
Did it talk to you?...
-- About your report here.
That's how you know him.
And to you if you listen.
-- I wanted to be him.
Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
I thought it was great.
It's fair.
Sure you do.
-- No no your turn.
Tell me a story.
Who's doing this?
Okay here's the deal.
I'll tell you a story you tell me one.
So you came to me...
I'm close...
Hey do I know you?
See you Monday.
Sorry but it's out of my hands.
Try again next year.
I need another one sir.
Why should I take you back?
You think I did?
Like it never happened...
You're the only one that knows.
Your brother was a good man.
We're close...
This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
So what do you want me to do?
You're so...
Did I say thanks?
Did you pull me out?
It had to be someone who knows numbers.
Then who wrote the report?
It's not even really a company.
Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
They knew each other.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
What the hell are you doing here?
That's the reason.
That's it!
-- Go to the bottom.
It started in this room.
So you were happy here.
You think you're the first?
I think we should get something straight here.
Then go find a corner.
Are you still here?
Oh man I'm sorry.
Where is he anyway?
I've been really busy.
How long have you been in town?
You look like...
Man you look great.
And you know what?
Let's get a picture.
This could be a great opportunity to move...
This one's still with the fire department.
I have a job.
Jesus Christ I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Could you believe that fire?
Do you have to do that?
How'd you know?
What the hell are we waiting for?
Completely out of control.
Your own company even.
You break anything with that you buy it!
Sorry there must be something wrong with my eyes.
We'll be back in a few minutes.
Your brother's right.
Well let's have a look.
He's not doing it right dad.
He never does it right.
He just wants to --
I'm busy.
-- No that's okay.
Look I'm sorry I --
can I talk to you a second...
Life and death right and wrong.
When someone called the fire department we came...
It's you go we go...
that's the end of the fucking world...
it's just there's nobody I can talk to...
In a fire?
Look I'm his brother.
Maybe not today maybe not in a year but it would've happened.
When was the last time?
You always have to be right.
I know he's out but how's he doing?
He's out.
You want some coffee?
How's he doing?
Here we go...
That's your job.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Anyway down here take a look...
And the world -- the whole world.
You're ready alright.
He works for me.
Who's this?
It knows us.
This one knows us.
I deal with this stuff every day.
you never get used to it.
What happened up there?
Was he listening?
I'm working on it.
This'll only take a minute.
I'm a little busy right now --
Jesus open your eyes!
I got it man!
I will find those kids.
You mean you could use it.
But you could do it baby.
We could use the bread...
Sure it is.
I got something for you.
But -- do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
What's to believe?
I'm not talking about the fucking Church.
But tell me.
Do you believe in God?
It's horrible.
She's fucking nine years old!
Come on man!
Or even for your little sister?
Like shit they would.
Who said anything about the fucking street.
This is New York man...
She could make serious money!
How could you understand.
So what are you doing here?
You brought it back to the Church.
And then it made it's way back to me again.
You'll have more product day after tomorrow right?
How are you doing man?
Just give me back a little something for the road.
Oh God my God.
Why do I have to know over and over that it was you.
After what I've done.
I've been bad.
You better be there!
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden.
We'll listen to the end of the game together.
There's nothing to think about.
Let me think about it.
Put in my bet.
It's still my money.
I want my money.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.
Never any other way.
So you had better just put in my fucking bet.
The Big One.
You've really got a problem.
Get this man.
I was at the game today.
Just make sure the bet gets in.
And I've been waiting here since -- forget it.
Do you have the money?
That's my problem.
Just put in my bet.
Take your money?
Double or nothing?
Are you fucking out of your mind?
You knew them?
Who were they Sister?
Who are these boys?
What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
I knew them; They learn in our school.
And they are good boys.
You see Father --
I also thought of that bread Father.
It's funny you knew.
Sister we all know what happened to you yesterday morning.
But you could have come to my office.
Yo Black you looking for trouble.
I'm on it.
Need I say more.
It's easy.
Everybody go it?
Can you do this for me?
What's his name again?
So now I see where you're coming from.
My true name is...
Give me some?
Well you did.
We're ready when you are.
And another thing you better stay away from my sister or you better...
What do I do?
I always worked hard for you.
Yeah that's easy for you to do.
You can walk away.
We both can.
So that's what you been doing?
In fact we never knew she had any friends period.
Must be the pressure.
What's wrong with him?
That's you.
You'd try anything.
You get ya own stuff.
I try her.
It's all over my face.
You might be right.
Life is beginning to look up.
That can be done.
What about in the mean time?
Not the in between time?
Good morning to you Mr.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We was coming to see you.
Son there is no such thing.
And I'm the feet.
Yo check it.
You hear me.
Did we get our bill yet?
I would like to change your name.
What do I have to do?
Well do something about it.
Can I finish?
All that stuff people talked in the old days it's over.
Who can play God?
Let's get right into it.
I want to meet her one day please tell her the great news.
These changes are not the way I want to go.
Do you want it that much.
Just meet the guy.
That's all I'm asking.
You can have that.
That's exactly my point.
I just want you to meet him.
Keep an open mind.
We think so.
It's the move.
What does everybody else think about this?
Ya first bad move.
Let'em try.
Could stop us from ever getting on.
I want you take it there.
You know how I know?
The name of the show?
Good so far.
What is it you want from me?
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.
That's exactly what I think.
I'm telling you it's not.
But that's dead.
You know what's happening.
Four minutes ago.
I'm sorry I'm late.
exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I love you too Daddy.
You never gave me no trouble.
Let's get him over to the bed.
Where do you go from here?
The same old same old.
Trying to get my stuff through.
Enough about me what's happening with you?
All I know is what happened to me.
That's the only reason period.
Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
How did you end up here?
I just like to drink.
My game is still strong.
Pleased to meet you.
Pull up a chair.
It's been a long time.
Go away unless you got my money.
I want to speak with you.
He asked me to come with him.
So what's up with you?
Not that often.
How long has my father been like this?
Is that so?
And that's how you got me in the first place.
The first and only time.
Come into the light.
He's just playing big brother.
You're the one that put us together.
We're friends.
Why'd you do that?
It's all good.
Is that good or bad?
Everybody shut up.
It's too funny.
Who's side are you on?
You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.
He got his.
What do you want me to say?
Your life will never be the same.
You've said that already.
The big one.
Which one is your brother?
This is the group I was telling you about.
I was making a point.
I need him.
After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do until then he's ours.
Maybe something happened to them.
And lose out on my money?
I'm in till the end.
You getting cold feet?
What point is that?
You lost me.
Not yet but this thing will never get made.
Do you know how you will use him?
How can this be?
If I would have known I would have known.
Nobody told me anything.
Anybody got an ideas?
Oh is that what I'm doing?
But I think you should give us all a chance.
Yes your name?
Let me ask you a question if I may.
How do you think she got the job in the first place?
Oh is it?
What you did is dead wrong.
What are you?
This is nothing.
I feel fine.
That's the way it came out.
Let me ask you one question.
I'm happy for all of us.
It's just we have a great responsibility now.
The pressure is on.
When are you coming up here to see your mother?
You know how your Daddy is.
Not at all?
Yes I have very hard.
Has Daddy called?
Of course I'm happy for you.
The show is a hit.
I'm doing okay.
Even more reason to see him.
Daddy's not with you.
Yes he did.
He said that?
He wants you to come and see him.
I'll be right over.
You've worked very hard.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy get a number or something.
We have enough of those on television already.
What kind of show is this?
You heard from Daddy?
But this is a different kind of show.
That's wonderful.
How's the food?
I said no such thing.
All I said is that something must be wrong.
The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
I always try my best.
Do a good show.
Maybe we learn from each other if that's possible no?
I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.
I feel we make a good team.
I never heard of that term before.
Where are you from?
I just turned twenty.
End of argument.
First I would like to say I love the show.
That's the way I want to feel about my work.
You've never seen me.
You look beautiful like that.
Not a class not a thing just picked stuff up by myself.
I never had a really real pair before.
Or better yet write your own show.
Do it better.
Money makes the world go round.
I've lived on the street.
Money and nothing else?
How do you see all of this?
Thanks for coming in.
That's what I like about you and me.
too late maybe around...
then what about...
not that time...
I heard different thought that was...
yes she did.
We should go out on a double date.
I thought you got rid of...
That'll work.
I just bought one for myself.
No not that.
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice like a...
Not her the one with the little...
The one with da big...
So you say.
Work it to the top.
That has nothing to do with you and I.
We did it one time only once.
It had nothing to do with the job it was stupid.
Just ask me what you want to know.
You leave something out?
I'll be down front.
You better start putting your face on.
My people love me.
You're sure this is a good idea.
We can look out for ourselves.
They had no choice.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Maybe you need to start.
Never read a book in my whole life.
No before my time.
This is a nice place.
Been one all my life.
The good stuff.
Not at all sir.
That is none of your business.
Good day to you young sir.
There's nothing else for it.
And I'll tell you what Mr.
I'll tell you what it is Mr.
John Best what's the matter here?
That will be sent after him.
I am not sure.
If you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.
What is the service sir?
How do you do sir?
Good morning Private James.
Please come in.
Sir I'm a British officer.
Shall we stop for dinner?
No the very same one my boy.
Was there another Mr.
She is now Mrs.
But why did you not write home to your poor mother?
You are but a boy.
He'll give the better mark.
I am not afraid of him.
Well if it must be it must.
I'll follow him if it's into the church and meet him there.
And so I am.
I have heard of them.
Ah -- I see.
For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I have said all there is to be said.
As you please.
All Europe shall hear of this!
But how sir?
But if they send you away then what is to become of me?
It will come out well for me.
Who else can give me information about you?
No one sir.
Here is my letter.
God of nature!
You have never known love.
I know better than you do.
Always my dear one never any further.
Will we always leave it at this?
You will do as you please.
Do you not agree?
To love you until death.
You want my heart?
It is only too possible.
That man has perhaps not yet been born.
Not even that.
But for a time...
Have you had one?
Well then I'll tell you what I'd do.
If ever I meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two.
Then you must get it.
I want the best.
All the same you must name an amount.
As much as possible?
As much as possible.
I am at your service Mr.
How much do you wish to spend?
Have you done Mr.
By name only.
What is to be done?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
When is he to go?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.
That's very kind of you Mr.
Have you lost much?
Are you serious?
I have good news for you Mr.
Yes he's fine.
Good night my little darling.
I am sorry for you Mr.
James hang yet?
Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Come come sir.
Good evening Mr.
James have you done with my lady?
My wife never comes near me.
What friend have I?
Indeed you are right sir.
Look at me.
Hang it Mr.
Can I use your phone?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You're either with us or against us -- which is it?
Maybe he's dead too.
Maybe he'll be there.
Either way we have to go.
Look at him!
Did -- did you --
What do we do?
Just safety your shit and get behind me okay?
I'll take care of this.
I'm -- I'm sorry...
West was one thing but this --
We found him like this!
We found him like this --
Can anybody hear me!
We can still come out of this okay.
That's the story.
West's dead.
We found him like this...
West is dead.
He's too good.
You know the rest.
He -- He made me do it --
We've found all of them.
What else do you have on me?
We're not finished yet --
Otherwise this is just another story --
You saw West's body.
I'm serious --
And that's all I'm saying.
Tell me about them.
I'm not telling you what happened.
There's no need...
Piece of work that guy.
What do you like then?
Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be.
Maybe somebody moved them.
you have nothing.
How do you know that?
Is that what I did now?
West told us it was there we just found it.
No did he tell you about it?
He said he worked there --
There were six of us...
Sir yes sir!
He is not to be given food water or clothes!
So did we.
he's dead.
Jesus what happened?
We wait and I'm a dead man.
This is a lot of information to be getting...
I have to think --
That's close range.
From up close or far away?
You saw West right?
Him or your friend?
That's exactly what he says about you.
Oh come on --
If not you then who?
It's not in me.
You know it's not like that --
What do you mean West's?
Where are they!
What does his father do again?
Any more questions?
This one too.
There's that word again.
Maybe an even ten.
I think that's it.
Maybe to have someone to cover for him.
Why did he come back for you?
Right in front of us.
But I was...
Then who did?
What do you think of that?
I've done nothing wrong.
I suggest you talk to us.
For the last time I have no idea what you're talking about --
And that'll be enough.
Not for long.
You will stand there and you will listen!
What happened to you Bill?
I wanted to see if he was okay --
Someone who knew how to get things done.
Stay where you are.
Not for this.
The one in control.
I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
I'm sorry Bill.
You think you could explain all this to me?
Was dead right.
What I said before --
I'm talking about West!
We had him Bill we were there.
What the hell are you talking about --
Home I'm done.
You mean not enough to save you.
Not for me.
He can wait.
Which gives us about five hours.
Why'd you call me?
And the problem is you only got three.
It's not West is it?
Tell me it's not West.
Tell me what I can do.
If there was any other way --
What kind of trouble are you in?
I read about what's been happening with you...
I should have called --
But he was a lot of other things too.
He was your friend.
They'll clear you.
Your phone number?
I should probably write that down.
Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Think it'll work?
Do I have a choice in this?
Far as I'm concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
That's not true.
So now you get mine.
What was it you said?
We need to talk --
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
Right back where we started.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Good just making sure.
So what now?
So did I.
You wanted to break him.
For fucking over the little guy.
Yeah I could've.
Let's go talk to Bill...
And if they're asked that's what they'll tell the world.
What happened next?
Why do you care?
But you will.
Nobody will ever know what happens here --"
I was starting to believe you you know?
You did more than try.
He did that every year he did that to me.
Sorry no can do.
That means under a year.
Wait for it...
Being back here.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there.
You're off to a late start.
The very same.
That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed.
I lost a bet.
When I do go at him with everything you got.
He's as bad as West and we both know it.
The thing is we've got a real opportunity here.
Oh you remember now --
They found him.
He came after us.
He's been trying to cover for me the whole time.
We got here you came to see me...
I told him what had really happened to West.
It will and you know why?
Running out of time are we?
Like I said I was in the kitchen.
No one else heard it?
Clear as day.
He said what?
He wanted more than that.
Things are not what they seem.
We just want --
Tell him to shut up --
I used it to start the fire --
One of those Section Eight boys worked in here.
Heard he got out okay.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
You think he did it?
There's only one I want.
You may not have much but what you got you got a lot of.
You could get any girl.
You just have to tell me who she is.
You'll be happy there.
Where does she live?
Friends of the family.
But then I lost her.
And I met mine.
No one's ever left.
This town is everything a man could ask for.
And if I were to end up here I'd consider myself lucky.
But the fact is I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
I have to leave.
I'm already running late.
He's still here.
Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.
Hell I'll have him tell you.
What ever happened to him?
What is this place?
This is my girl.
Let's see it.
I brought it.
Fine I'm doing it.
Fine you do it.
Fine I will.
Then do it.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon.
And that's the real story of how you were born.
Not that one.
The real story.
Did he ever tell you that?
A thousand times.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
How long have you known my father?
We never talk.
Be good for you to talk to him.
Can I see him?
It's good to see you.
I should never have let you think that...
I am in love with my wife.
Lord I'm sorry I...
I can get it.
I can just...
It's okay just leave it.
I thank you for your time.
Your last name is different.
You can ask anyone in town.
I want the best for everyone.
In so many words yes.
So I've heard.
No one would come out here unless they had business.
You're buying the town.
When I'm really supposed to.
And that's not much difference at all.
I'm eight.
It's not a woman it's a fish.
What did she look like?
Did you see that woman?
And I like you.
There was one time when I was eleven...
Never really known why.
Well it's not a short one.
Will never told you that?
Probably just as well.
He would have told it all wrong anyway.
I never knew.
Can I take your picture?
No I understand.
Terrible for her but think about me young boy with that kind of power.
That's terrible.
You're not trying to run away?
You take the other way and I'll cut through here.
Meet you on the far side.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
What did she say?
So what do you say?
But I want to leave with you.
That's why they sent you here.
You're a big man.
You should be in the big city.
You become what you always were.
A very big fish.
And that's the way it happens.
Story of my life.
You're getting ready to go.
And I say...
Let's get out of here.
I can try Dad.
If you help.
Just tell me how it starts.
How I go.
How what happens?
Tell me how it happens.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born.
Good bad everything.
Just show me who you are for once.
What do you want Will?
Who do you want me to be?
But that's all I've ever seen.
That's all I do Will.
And that's what it is with you Dad.
But the real story is how I got the car.
We heard it.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Oh so you know.
I used to do it when you were gone remember?
I used to do it a lot.
If you wanted to you could...
You mean while I'm here.
When did you ever work in an office?
And every day I gave him a quarter.
Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks.
And when I went back there you know what he said?
So how does it happen?
And this is not how it happens.
It's not my time yet.
You think I'm up for it?
No but I hear it's terrible.
Did you do any of that?
I do not like the story.
I can tell them as well as you can.
How can you not understand that?
Come on Will.
Which never happened!
What a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Make him stop.
Go out with me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
How did you get so many?
But you're wrong.
He was a few years older than you.
This is it?
So what are you up to now?
I'm happy for you.
There was a whole life out there that I was not living.
And maybe if you'd seen more you could.
I need those!
See to him there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about.
Especially this late in the game.
Can I ask you a question?
Why did you come here today?
I've seen him with women.
He always has.
Everyone in town knew him.
How did you know my father?
And you're Will.
I could feel it.
It seems every hour I have to...
Down the hall on the right.
You have to really pull it.
I'll bet you need to --
I am always on your side.
And I think you should talk to him.
I need you on my side.
You're not.
Look I know why you like him.
What is ""true?
"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
But it's not true.
You have to understand.
And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else.
With another house another family.
Or maybe there is no family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.
Do you love him?
Do you love your father?
You never told me any of that.
You never told me how your parents met.
I talked with your father last night.
You need to go.
It's more than they thought.
It's bad.
That's okay?
I'll stay.
In case he...
So you never bought any land.
But we sold that right away.
That really happened?
Do you know who that is?
Was she one of your teachers?
I always have.
I know it's not easy.
If you ask me it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Or ever will.
The problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someone's wife.
No it's not.
It's exactly the same.
Just the same as you two.
But that's a different...
Yes Will I do.
How much time does he have left?
How is he?
He's up with your father.
How did you get here?
It was quite good actually.
Yeah it was okay.
I've been buying you stuff all week.
I've been buying him stuff all week.
You know what for.
Put it in the cases.
You're what?
What are we supposed to do with a baby?
You heard what I said.
Say thank you.
We'll stop then.
Do you want to stop?
We can stop.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Sixty four thousand eight hundred.
I'm so sorry.
He is sure you can do this.
Of course you can not.
I've got eight hundred pounds.
He wants all the money that is in your bank.
We'll go down there.
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll give him money.
Tell him to put the...
He wants a lot of money.
He wants money.
What does he want.
We must do what he says.
I have brought you trouble.
You can stay tonight.
I'm so sorry
How is bank?
We look away.
Look John I will show you something.
I suppose it's...
Do you believe in love?
Tell me what he said.
Do you like England?
Go for it John!
So how long will you be in England?
Yes it's okay.
Thank you for the food.
I asked her if you were happy to see us.
I find it hard to tell with you.
We better watch him.
So hang on.
You mean from the beginning?
This is for you.
I need to know who you are first please.
I'm asking what you're here for.
You've lost me...
Hang on hang on sorry but like who are you?
Mine's still John.
I'll wait for you here.
Maybe you will find out.
What does it mean?
Tell me about it.
It's a long way to go for a date.
It's more like a date.
It's what you came back for.
It's not mine either.
It's not mine.
This will be my last one.
I think I better just go.
I've got an hour.
Can I buy you a coffee?
It's alright.
What was her name?
I've got news for you.
It's not working.
She is not dead?
She's not dead at all.
Did she leave you?
Who did she leave you for?
Your best friend?
Did she leave you for a woman John?
It's none of your business.
the girl with small eyes.
Maybe a little.
Have you had any before?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Well what have you got?
You have to do all this and what have you got to show for it?
Thank Christ for that.
He was very kind and strong.
So how old were you when you met him?
Please there's no...
It's a different world.
So what did you want?
I think we understand each other no?
I got what I paid for.
I think you got what you paid for.
So now you hate all women?
And who says what is wrong.
It's wrong.
To make money.
I'm not listening.
It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
He will come back.
Not the kids type then is he?
But you know so what?
Of course he does.
Look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Give me some money.
I can look after myself.
No you're not..
Where's the...
In every sense.
If at all possible.
In the world.
You must think...
Why else would you send off for me?
You get your life back.
It's makes it easier.
Can you follow me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Sorry that's a stupid...
It's about forty miles from here.
It's a nice house.
Is that everything?
How do you want to pay?
Is it full?
Please could you check.
I'm sorry Sir.
Yeah I know.
Just wanted to see.
Just like you.
They all I got left.
I want love in my life.
Yes I do.
Mean to say...
There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say but...
they it is.
It was wrong.
But at the time...
Can I come in?
I need ya help again.
That'd be nice.
Hope you enjoy it.
Well that's good.
I'm happy to hear it.
Of course that's none of my business.
So if you...
just take it.
But if she gets worse you give me a call.
I wrote my number on the box.
Oh she older than that.
give her to me to look on.
You take her to a doctor?
You can talk to me.
I'm standing most of my day.
They're for support.
Gave me a start.
all kind's live shit.
For your hands?
Mind I ask what's all this business here?
Well that makes it easier.
Make yourself at home.
You done it already.
I got better.
And since we been together...
YOU HAD A PLAN!
I know about how she was like.
But we was different.
I's the only person she talked to about it.
With all the shit she kept doing!
You never had that shit back in school...
Kitchen looks just like I left it.
You been home yet?
Got real down.
Like she run off with someone.
She's around.
She's not at home...
none of her friends seen her anywhere.
Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school.
just not in time for....
It's a long process but...
they sent me home.
Sit down man.
I bet you did.
This thing you got...
But that piece of shit?
I got others.
You go to hell.
Pound this and I'll join you.
It gets worse there.
That's just not good.
And he did.
It's so stupid.
Says he wants to move.
I said okay.
How about now?
And this how you do me!
And that's what you did.
At the church maybe they's...
Better than what you give.
Talk to me about sick.
it just got sick.
I feel it.
I got living to do.
How many times?
I mean that's it.
Like a man.
I'm too old to play house...
So let's have it.
End me or get out of my face!
she turn around and give it all to another man.
She with a real man now.
You mean like if you a man or not?
YOU SHUT UP!
Well this one's yours now.
You ready to take care of it?
You like it?
Get a good picture in your mind.
What I love.
Just do as I say and close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
And think about...
No you do it.
I know that.
it's there in my head.
I got to.
You took care of your wife like you do me?
Be here all afternoon.
You ready for this?
He told me...
his heart was...
Tell me what to do.
I had love in my heart.
And I gave it to one woman.
And she gone now.
I'm here with you.
My life is gone.
And I lost it.
If you want...
I can take you back to town now.
You take it straight?
Well get to it.
And let me tell you...
What do you know how to make?
Let go of me...

I've seen it in nature I've seen it in men.
Like you somebody's dog.
and understand the word of God.

You like this?
Now you get up!
And you get in my house!
LET ME GO!
I'll do whatever you want.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!
AND LET ME GO!
We got everything we need.
Plenty of food.
Get you to the kitchen.
The hell you know about me?!
You got no right to talk to me about that shit!
The hell you think you are?
Do me like this you mean?
These men you up under.
How you let them do ya like that?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet.

or however you call it...
Remember like I say I found you in the road...
Then I better be on my way.

Take it easy now.
It got some miles on it but my boys say she run good.
That's just how it came to me.

How a girl get like that?
She into football you know.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Go ask him.
Just wanted to know who she was.
Now hold up.

Sometimes she need the real deal so she call me up.
Why you say that?

I got two girls.

She her own you know?
You know a white girl?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time?
Yeah you know you home old man.

The hell is this shit?
Not like that.
You believe He wants this?
This all looks wonderful.
I expect you to come.
Left for dead.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I told you to TURN BACK!
So you do as I say...
He knows where ya at.
This is your home.
That kind of talk is between us.
Not a day.
Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Got plenty to eat.
That your first time?
That's between her and me.
It's private.
What happened in there...
I got it Mr.
That's what she said.
Keep the change on that.
And tell him how you feel.
It starts like this...
Starts in my head.
then everything'll go back to normal you know.
He's all I got in my life that's special.
When I can do that for him...
do what they want and then...
You could put it that way.
That you say sorry for all you done and...
Told me how you and he...
you and everybody...
Yeah I do.
I feel better.
I'm a what?
I came in here to get sick.
anyway I got sick.
Just about anything you know.
It can be funny or...
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
You know how I get.
I'll be okay.
It's stupid...
It's so fucking stupid!
just tell me...
we can just talk about it...
Just say how you knew...
I'll go along with all you say about me.
And you let him do it.
Some big nobody in your life...
and you let him do as he wanted...
with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I just wanted some make-up.
Can you see that?
I know I did.
You never needed nobody.
Always made that clear to me.
That's not why...
I mean you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember.
I'm the only family you got.
You need money again?
What happened to your face?
The hell you call me?
Hey that's what you need girl.
What you sick?
What'd I tell you?
you called me.
Thought you had a man for that.
You got any money?
He's a sorry old guy but I like him.
Hit him or something.
I hope not.
This the right place?
You said that in the last two places.
This should be it...
Hey we're getting Mr.
You hear things.
I just want you to know...
I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
What'd you say?
I call right?
They say we got to turn around and come right back.
That's what they say.
I got a plan.
Maybe we should do something?
It'll pass when we bag him.
What are they doing now?
-- Hey I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Get rid of it.
I think you did just fine.
I think you did great.
Hey all right.
What'd she say?
If you give me one.
Give me a break would you?
You'll take care of that.
I came to save you.
How can you be so sure?
Call for help.
What's that for?
You have one?
How many men?
An hour from the train station.
I like him waiting.
Not now man okay not now.
Work with me.
It's done.
What's in the box?
It's a new deal.
coming with me tomorrow?
It's very small.
I want to go talk to him.
We're through.
I'll check it out.
You were too far behind.
Did I say that?
There she is!
You said you could keep up with her!
Only one way to find out...
Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
He says they're very nice.
What's he saying?
We can ask someone I used to work with.
Someone I pay money to...
How'd you get this?
You must leave?
It may be too soon to talk about it.
keep something of their's.
Why the hell not?
Give us a break...
What's the problem here?
We got to keep looking.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
I'd like that.
Might be different in New York.
Why would you care?
We're in?
Tell them I'm not.
Who am I supposed to be?
Not if it works.
I'll meet you at the train?
You met her.
Where's the wife?
He's got a reason.
And I'm supposed to care?
I'm buying.
I paid for that.
I could use some help.
Show me around.
I'll pay you for your time.
An outside person.
He gets as much as he wants.
Then take it from him.
This is my stop.
Time I've got plenty of.
She's such a long way home for you.
You are a lucky man.
Where you come from a man can stand out.
I'm taking you back.
Keep the change.
Be on it.
It's not your job.
What if I say no?
They want him first.
Then we can have him.
Not in that company.
This by this...
Do you know how to find her?
Even where to start?
We will find them.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Let me out of here!
Could you fill me in?
Do you know what this is?
We're police officers.
It is not allowed.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.
You want him dead too.
He'll find out you took me.
If I say no?
Whatever you want.
You know the city and the police.
I'll pay you.
Find it for me.
Why tell me this?
I want him.
I gave him a home a future...
But let's use the short form.
I'm looking for --
The best there has ever been Mr.
Then go get him.
He must be good.
Let's go while there is still time.
He knows what he's doing.
You certainly have a nice place here.
We're not used to the big city.
Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Put it this way.
But not to last.
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
And what can he do for you?
Here's your check my boy.
No you stay here with us.
Out last night together.
Just thought I'd...
You're our best and only friend.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.
But he's not an easy man to get to.
His company made us.
He's not really my friend.
I just do a job for him now and then.
You could help us.
We have a lot in common.
Show me something?
You're just all so...
Well no not really.
You live here all by yourself do you?
Save a little for everybody.
I want to do it.
Now show him why.
I think therefore I am.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.
How are things at home?
Tomorrow he says.
He's not ready yet.
I got it.
That's an order from as high as it comes.
Okay here it is.
The cat is about to get out of the bag.
Pressure is definitely on.
Take a number.
She's not with you?
Look go home.
Get some rest.
Then let her get away.
I was just about to have my dinner.
You better get on it.
Where do we start?
You got a machine on it yet?
What was he after?
Day after tomorrow.
When might that be?
Soon as I finish the job.
Well when do you get paid?
I think we're through for the night.
I know all that.
Here's something you might find interesting.
I'm coming to that.
How do I stop one?
Are you with me?
Why yes of course.
How long do I live?
How old am I?
One more eh?
I like you too.
But this one is not guy.
It is girl.
You want to see my friends?
I'll but you one.
What'll you have?
But I would like to buy you drink.
I think I have no money.
Let's hear it.
I got a problem.
But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
From what I hear you're doing great.
Hey it's okay.
So how are you doing?
I'm great.
I mean I know I'm not really great but I feel just great.
My job is here.
But if you could?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
What if you change your mind?
During the road test...
Lots of places.
Book the good ones for where?
What did she want?
There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
What am I supposed to be looking for?
And who do I go to about you?
I bet I would.
Does it eat?
It's a good job.
Of course he's not real.
It that mother real?
Are you for real?
Like to get this position.
You know what I think?
Just wait here.
What difference will it make?
Nobody could stand me that long.
What's a long time?
You mean a woman?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
I never felt better.
Part of your education.
But then how can you...
I think I missed something.
I read that.
I wish I could.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Not too good.
How are you doing?
How come you're not on the job?
Me and my dad.
Who is this?
I told you I'd come back.
What do you want me to do?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
I can imagine.
I think you need more help than you've got.
I've already got more help than I need.
Is there anything else?
It would be my child.
You show the picture to your husband.
I'd take him to the doctor.
You have a little boy.
Also I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
For the responsibility of your power.
Why should I be?
If it's a benefit it's not our problem.
I'll see you in a minute.
You'd better get in here.
You know where I been.
Where the hell you been?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Five maybe six.
How many questions does it usually take Mr.
How many questions did it take?
The machine works.
If she is the machine works.
Sitting next to you.
Where's the subject?
Like you said Mr.
May I ask a personal question?
How do you know I'm not?
But I understand what you mean.
But how come I'd be there?
Answer quickly as you can.
Already had I.
What makes you think so?
As a matter of fact I did.
Ah you get hold of your friends?
Is that why you're still here?
What's your problem?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
I've got stuff.
We sure did.
What about friends?
You want to go home?
And a lovely one!
You would like her very much!
No I'm not!
He's really funny!
This is my new friend...
Oh now that's a great one!
Young man stop right there!
And please be sure to pay my bill!
Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Well that depends...
For how long?
There's a difference.
Very well thank you.
I'm with the County Family Services Department.
How do you do?
It certainly is.
I agree with you completely.
And I was just--
My mother's like that.
I'm very good at making things work!
It makes their life..
Could I please just go home?
It's the best thing.
The best thing for you.
I'm serious!
""  You know it?
Is that what you call it?
Well you had better!!
What if this is for life?!
Well you should be!
and I'm really sorry.
What in the hell are you doing here!!
I'm really sorry!
Let me tell you the whole thing.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
I think that you are the most--
You wanted to see me!
And what do I say?
But that's how it works.
That's a nice way of putting it.
Look at her!
I like her.
Not that one!
I thought I was here to meet women.
We're here on business!
This place is something!
You think I'm just somebody you can buy off!
Listen let me tell you something--
That's all I ask.
I'll give you every single card I've got left!
But a wife?
No it's not!
I certainly do!
It's that way!
It's fine.
Just give it a try.
Whatever you two want.
Try to listen.
So what are you seeing?
Of course in the house.
It's in there.
In the house?
He has a computer?
Where's he gone?
That's where you'd go to find girls!
You live in...
to find a wife!
I'm seeing...
Way up North.
Are we getting hot?
Okay let's see...
Here you go.
We lived together for about six months.
I've still kind of got a thing for him.
Why thank you!
May I ask you a question?
Is this your house?
I was wrong!!
You said it would be easy!
Never drive again!
Now get out!!
Could we talk about that a little later?
That's what I was afraid of.
that could take some time.
When do you need her by?
What kind of wife are you looking for?
Everybody knows that.
The big one!
I would like you to help me find a...
This is for me.
Then forget it.
Oh I'm sure it will!
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
- -  but I'd just be lost without you.
It's your life.
Hey you know.
I was thinking...
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Who are these people?
You got it!
Wait here while I change.
What's fair?
What's the pay?
How long would you need me?
Why not go to work for me?
That's why!
Who the hell knows?!
Why does it never work out?
Not that you even need to know that!
What have you been doing?
I think it's the eyes.
Oh stop that!
Listen I know you like me.
Not me exactly.
Is he your husband?
I knew this would happen!
Well so long.
Why are you doing that?
Okay down boy.
So here take it back.
Now take it.
I thought I'd never see you again!
Yeah same here.
I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I know a short-cut.
Hey what are you doing?!
Listen to this part.
This is where it really takes off!
Take it easy!
You had him!
What is it?!
Mind if I change the station?
What the hell?
You got a deal.
And that's it?
I've got two of him!
He's all yours.
I'll make a deal with you!
Get away from me!!
Well that changes everything.
I mean it!!
Do you own a car?
Not completely but pretty much.
That's exactly right!
I knew it!
Yes I'm right?
Right so far?
Oh that's nice.
I have this thing.
I came on a bus.
Here pick these up!
You're lost?
No I'm lost.
No you get out of here.
Get out of here!
I'm from out of town.
I'm here on business.
Fill this out please.
And I'll need a card.
We met earlier.
I've got almost everything we need!
And this nice man...
The front door is open.
Will you be back?
How do I leave here?
That's always a good idea!
Would you like some money?
I have a great deal of it.
I've got to go now.
I know it has been terrible.
Everything has been so awful!!
That was my father!
Yes oh yes!
Are you all right?
You've got to hand it to 'em!
Poor poor us!
That's kind of how it was.
The Cold War is over.
This is great son just great.
Well in that case...
of course son.
I'll try.
One more thing.
Maybe we have been down here a little too long!
We wait for night.
we must be at our...
Well do we just go on up?!
Then why go there?
He's out there!
It's a game son.
It's yours now.
These are wonderful.
By the way it's time I gave you something.
You're right!
It's Tuesday already!
It's Tuesday.
They're pretty.
Can I have them?
This is what money looks like.
And thanks for always being happy!
Does that work?
I know what you mean!
I'll be right back!
Thank you my friends.
That was close.
Why did you park way back there?
I LOVE THIS!!
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Almost all of them.
Not on him.
Let's go eat!
Well you're right.
It's so small.
This must be very new.
When did we get it from them?
Who use to own it?
Well we try.
Listen let me just ask you a few questions.
Why not just go to...
She's right?!
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
That's right?
And it's called...?
It's a very small place.
Well I hope you like these!
How old do I look?
who I'm really beginning to miss.
It's my first night away from home.
You've been very very nice.
Well that's great then!
I'm lost!
And that's almost...
How much are they?
I do alright.
Oh you got a problem with that?
Well we're here to help!
Oh that would be wonderful!
I see what ya mean.
Tell you what...
Well where are you --
This is your bedroom?
We have to go.
You have more than enough of everything.
Then we'll be back to get you.
Are you in trouble son?!
You're my parents.
Your father has a few final words for you.
We both do.
you know while I was up there and all...
that maybe I could you know...
try to meet a girl.
I've been thinking about that a little...
just these last...
fifteen years or so.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Write that down.
There might still be one standing.
I'll be all right.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll go up.
He seems to be doing all right now.
Let's get him into the bedroom.
You never know.
A nice one I hope.
But you know-I believe him.
I think he just wants to go home.
I have to.
Not the police!
Oh my God!
All back East.
Well he and Mrs.
I have to go!
I have to...
And if you want a girl I can be a girl.
I can be anything you want me to be!
Yes I can tell that just looking around.
""  Did you say you were a ""country boy?
""Hell up here?
So tell me...
has it been...
hell up here?
Yes I've got a light!
To keep what's up there from getting down here!
Well that's...
I thought ten years.
How long will you set it for this time?
Yes dear I know.
--do as I say!
--and we will--
Even if it's terrible!
We'll make do.
We've just about run out of everything!
We stay down here.
So what do we do now?
That's right!
Yes yes it is!
Just open the door.
I know exactly what you mean!
You know when we do go up...
If we still have one.
We'll know then.
What a thing to say!
Well we did in my family!
And I made these!
Who else would have done it?
It's not life worth living perhaps but believe me something's moving around up there.
Yes you certainly will.
Just the way it used to be.
Look at us!
Much like his father.
young for school.
Not bad for a three and a half year old!
We looked all over for you.
What are you doing back here?
if I could have a...
I think it's just right.
What shall we call him?
Now it's time.
I told you!
I've got everything!
How could you?!
This is just like home!
I've given you the most well-done cut.
All our friends...
If not for ourselves for the child.
To go up.
Thirty -five years!
To keep us from trying to leave.
To you maybe.
As long as we've got that straight.
I've read up on it.
That could happen any time.
How long will we have to stay down here?
I'll come back for the radio.
Oh much worse.
You remember that?
You hear that?!
They all do.
It's not time yet.
I still have--
It's time.
We'll do this again!
Maybe next week.
Well put it down and come in!
Stop it you two!
You came back for these?
Maybe he'll call.
No wait a minute.
We came back to the house!
That's new.
Wait a minute!
He said today he knew where home was.
What happened this morning?!
Where did you go?!
I like to think so.
He was always so ""nice""!
How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?!
what is ""nice""?
I'll tell you that.
Was it ever?
That's thinking.
The guy was on the level!
And what do you do?!
It's all just so...
We'll find him.
Give it back to him.
What do you want to do with it?
Well you're...
You did the right thing.
Well what was I supposed to do?!
Where did he get all that information?
The cars the clothes the houses...
You know I asked him about that.
Know what else he told me?
Yes you do.
Now hold on!
I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What's it to you?!
Who did he leave with?
We did not leave together.
What's that mean?
he might of.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.
It's nothing personal.
Always good advice.
Just be yourself.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway.
Alright I will.
What's that supposed to mean?
But first you have to start with the clothes!
Give me your hand.
Out-of-town.
That's all he'll say.
where on earth are you from?
Think about it!
I've heard worse.
I knew you'd like him.
I'll give it to ya no money down.
Yeah that's it!
Buy it from me?
Could I like...
It's like hard.
I've got a problem here.
Everything's okay now.
Look I better go.
I've seen a few.
Have you seen any?
That sounds nice.
I'm not sick.
How's Dad?
This is all I have.
Let's drink to something else.
Oh here they are.
How the shit are ya?
Come sit down.
Hey I brought some friends.
Oh my God.
I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.
Yes it's me!!!
Alright you better be.
I sure am.
You're all through with this now?
Who knows you have these?
No not at all.
I took it upon myself.
I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to but it's over now for sure.
I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
The first picture is this.
Okay come on in.
I'm sorry to bother you but I've got to talk to you.
Come on in.
It's blue.
Why do you do it?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Anything you can tell me?
These are beautiful.
How's the case coming?
And it's horrible too.
That's the way it has to be.
I'm sure you do understand.
It must be great.
I was the same way when I was your age.
I'll drive you home.
It's on my way.
Yep that's right.
Let's take a look at it.
I've got it here in this bag.
I thought I should bring it to you.
I understand he's in the hospital.
Where have you been?
Yeah it's me.
You look beautiful to me.
I hate that.
I think I better go.
I want you to stay with me.
I feel it getting cold.
There's so much I want to tell you.
I do I do.
Did you know that?
Did you know that I love you?
Well get away then!
Sometimes I think I do.
I asked first.
Do you love me?
I told you.
I think I know some of what is happening to you.
Go to the police.
Do you want to do bad things?
Are you a bad boy?
I'm doing it.
What do you want to do?
Do you like my body?
I know the difference between right and wrong.
How could he?
I want you to stay.
Please please stay.
I should go.
Or do you just want me?
Maybe I'll need to.
I came back to help you.
You know where I live.
Why are you so interested?
Why do you keep asking me?
But you're in very big trouble.
Are you in with them?
Why are you in so much trouble?
You think you know so much.
There you go again.
Stop saying that.
You can make it.
Who's it you mean.
Who's he?
I'm alright.
Can you stand up?
Why are you here.
Some day I'll show you where.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I better go.
I know you though.
What is happening?
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Yes I like you.
Do you like me?
You can hit me if you want to.
They're getting hard.
Do you like the way I feel?
I'll go then.
Sure I'm alright.
Do you like talk like that?
Do you like that?
What do you want from me?
Just let me leave.
NO you come on.
I want to see you.
Never before this.
That's what I said.
You wanted to talk to someone?
Something in an hour.
What did you hear on the phone.
Word for word.
I saw you come in talk on the phone.
Tell me what you saw tonight.
Hey I've seen you before.
Just to see if I could do it.
You better tell me something.
Who sent you here?
You tell me!!
GET OUT OF THERE!!!
Put your hands up on your head.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Oh yeah that's good.
You'll see I'll get you.
No way get out.
Yeah maybe so.
Hey pretty pretty.
If you want to.
Can I feel 'em?
WHAT ARE THESE?
Look at these.
Then shut up!
You want to see him too right?
Maybe something for you too.
He's a friend.
We were just talking.
It's daddy shit-head.
I sure know that.
Yeah but how many more are out there?
I'll tell you though you're okay.
He had to have her.
To make her do things.
We're looking for him.
You know what a love letter is?
You like me?
You like to walk.
Hell that's a good idea.
Okay let's go.
Hey let's go.
Good let's drink up.
There ya go.
I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Is something wrong?
What's happened to your face?
Can I use the car tonight?
Do you want the car?
It would be too much for him.
So please let him think as he does that you're home just to see him.
Be right down.
Not right in the middle of the term.
That sounds great!
Would anyone like coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father.
I know your mother from church.
Really he'll be home soon would you like a cup of coffee?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions that's all.
Maybe I better go.
He'll be back any minute now.
I mean that's the point.
No you're right.
Good deal Dad.
It's good to see you Dad.
Good to see you son.
I just saw him outside.
I will believe me.
Be sure your father comes.
Something is happening over there.
Let's get her over to your father's.
Take her to my house.
Do you have anything to put around her?
I like that idea that's a real good idea.
I'd rather not talk about it.
It's not far.
What was that all about?
Friday's on!
I just had to tell him some of what I knew.
Is Friday still on?
I'll see him at the police station okay?
See you Friday night if not before.
Well forget me - you have to tell him.
I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Yeah I worry a lot.
I got you into this.
You worry about me really?
Now get this.
Nothing really but it's interesting.
They know each other.
They seem to like each other.
That's what makes it so good.
I'll try to talk to him later.
You want to go talk to him?
I'm really sorry.
You were late.
See ya tomorrow.
Okay be careful.
I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five okay?
No silly - I'm still in school you know.
So are you.
We better get back.
In fact the night I met you.
And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.
Why is there so much trouble in this world?
You're sure right.
Why should it?
I mean a little you know.
I've been in twice.
You saw a lot in one night.
Also it could get you in trouble.
Should you tell my father?
This is what I have found out.
What I think I have found out.
They have a son.
There is another man involved.
You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door.
You want to tell me about it?
What did you see?
Well I've found out some things nothing really for certain.
Well how did it go?
That's for me to know and for you to find out.
I'll see you.
I mean call you okay?
Look it can wait till Sunday.
Okay yeah call.
Oh okay can I call?
I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Leave it in the front of your house for me okay?
It'll be okay.
I think you should go home.
Can you drive this car?
I'll drink to that.
Here's to.
An interesting experience.
That sounds good.
What's the plan.
I'll walk over to your house.
Is that good?
I already know.
First of all we'll have a nice dinner.
There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
What do want me to do?
Well it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl.
It's Friday do you have a date tonight?
Are you game for more?
So what's next?
I only saw his back.
Yes and no.
I was just about to go to the door when that man did my job for me.
Was it alright?
Wait a minute what's her name?
You've got a point there.
Let's just try the first part.
If that goes well we'll see about the rest.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I have a plan which I think will work.
There is very little for you to do but I do need your help.
I got to thinking.
Alright now tell me.
Just a minute pull over and wait a minute.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Like you said.
It was nice talking to you.
He moved away.
What happened to him?
It's not bad but it's bad enough.
It's a lot worse for my father.
They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while which is nice.
Left his whole business and family his wife and two kids.
What about those other people?
They're supposed to see you.
Where are they?
That's the building.
Not really why?
You want to see the building?
Come on I'll show you.
And some others.
I hear things.
I heard some of the same names.
Come on you brought it up.
Do you know anything?
That's too bad.
I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.
What are you doing now?
What else is new?
How is Central these days?
I just know that's all.
I remember you from Central.
Yeah how did you know?
You shut up.
Come on out a minute okay?
Could I talk to you a minute?
You can change it if you want to.
Up his house.
Just for him?
What did he bring him in for?
Go find one.
There's ways around that.
Hey I just...
Are ya ready?
I mean it now.
Lord's name.
Do you want to talk to them?
I'm not saying one way or the other.
Look under the body.
We're here brother.
You love me man.
Let him go.
They got nothing.
What that guy?
I told you I never saw him before!
My father his father before him that sort of shit.
That's some good shit.
I'm the guy!
I mean who makes the cut?
Right out in public man.
Anybody see ya?
He knows you man.
He knows all you want is to move up.
But a guy like you?
That's just not the way things are done.
Figure it out.
You think they sold me out?
Think about it man.
in that room?
Get a hold of yourself man.
What did you do?!
Let's do him right here.
In and out.
Where'd you get them?
We're on the same side!
Oh shit please!
I'm the funny man.
Out with it.
Who came out first?
Well there's my boys.
Well you know how it is with him.
Have ya lost it woman?!
Mother is that you?
Then we move on to New York.
I'll see what I can do.
Well we could try the bag over the head thing.
Walk you right out the front.
Know anything about that?
met them last night.
me up the...
Would someone please come over here and...
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
For if you do there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three.
He's a good man.
There he goes.
Are we ready to bring this man into the light?
So what do you think?
Did you tell him?
And everyone thinks the same thing...
Oh you're good.
Yes we are.
Oh we're good man.
That was way easier than I thought.
We're doing some serious shit here.
We'll find it.
What is all this ""they"" shit?
Know what we need man?...
Maybe someone saw and talked.
We're ready.
""We just got up and left.
It's been twenty-seven years.
Do you know where that term comes from?
let's get ya started.
They were friends.
How do you figure?
And it's the same story over here.
This guy is big time.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
Of course they were.
Can she I.
She was in here when it went down.
You're the first one that's ever got that.
oh god why?
Where's my cat?
A lot of people saw it.
Nobody's talking.
This look like a fucking post office to you?
which means this.
No way they could have seen it?
Now stay with me boys.
He was the only one done right.
Two in the back of the head.
The what man?
Really want to know?
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL!
No way they could have seen it.
and think about it.
That's very particular.
I feel something big here.
Oh my god!
We have to go now.
Well I'm sold.
When we're done she can I.
like that's your new thing right?
He's the one who set me up.
You sure you're okay?
Anybody call for me?
This is the last time I'll see you.
If you think about it it's all you can do really.
What are you serious?
This is some heavy shit.
Oh shit please no.
I'm the funny man!...
the funny man...
Thank you Father thank you.
I was thinking that too.
All I needed was to hear you say it!
I'll help them.
They would never do that.
I believe these young men are right.
I want to stand for what I believe in father.
to take a stand.
Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Has he now?
You feel these men are necessary.
But in this day and age I believe what they do is...
I feel it is...
What is it my son?
Why have I come to a church?
I never have before.
felt I should.
Do your thing Father.
Father I'll do you right here.
I'm sorry I'm sorry.
He says ""What's your third wish?
Okay there's a white guy.
he's a black guy.
The funny man.
Well I got a new job for you just for now.
What is it they call you?
Come back here.
Said I had to give it to him myself.
Well it's the funny man.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
What's he in for?
What can I say?
So how is it in there?
We're not sure yet.
Oh I'd say about --
How big is it?
We're not sure.
Pretty much everything.
What'd he get?
So is Mr.
Yes there is.
There's not enough time.
I'll get him.
I'll see you there.
Did you lose him?
Help me move him.
Get against the wall!
Who did that?
I've got a great view up here.
I can see all the --
It's supposed to be.
Take your second position.
Hang on a second.
We all set?
You're all clear.
So do I.
As a girl.
As a person?
He was all right.
He was a nice guy.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
It's pretty good.
Working on the job.
Good friends with Mr.
Mark that down.
Get out of the way.
He seems pretty good.
Let me feel that.
What time did he say to be here?
What exactly is this place?
You'll meet him this afternoon.
Who's Mr.
That's where we get our information.
I want you to look at this.
You want to meet him?
Who's in the car?
Couple days ago.
When'd you get back?
That's what she is!
She needed it.
Where's the rest?
That's not correct.
What is ""not good"" to you?
Only a few hundred --"
Our money situation is not good.
But there's --
I think we better go home.
No I'm serious.
No one to back me up.
Now I have a good idea.
So unless you come up with something better --
I know we can.
It's real simple.
I have an idea for that.
We need a car.
We just went for a walk --
Would of been nice.
I wish I'd been there.
I'll see you later.
You were just --
If you wanted to go?
Just leave me here by myself?
He told you and you let him do it.
Where was I?
When'd he tell you?
He went back for his brother.
He took his stuff.
He's gone.
I should of seen this.
They always said Mr.
See now we've got a plan.
That's a given.
Now that makes sense.
We'll hang out for a couple of days.
On the left.
Which one was that?
Did you tell these people your real name?
May I have a word with you please?
That's just not possible all right?
It's not a plan.
It's just --
Get back to me on that one.
Once your plan is worth a shit.
No I'm not saying her.
Get set go.
I'll say it.
I'll just say it.
What about them?
Yes they are.
See if mine are in there.
It's only fair that...
Well then cut it in half.
He did what he's supposed to do.
Like he meant it.
The manager looks at me.
What about what that guy said?
We got it.
Is that the manager?
Where's the manager?
You're out!
I'm not working with either one of you!
It's all of ours.
That's a good question.
However I will say --
Just turn right here.
Is it back in?
That's not bad.
Yeah I heard that.
No just do it real quick.
I'll meet you down there.
Yeah I saw it.
Did you see that?
You know exactly what you're saying.
Did you ever think of that?
There's just not time for it.
They have a very special value for her.
I know the value of money.
She's really kind of hot.
Would they do that?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
This is he.
This is he?
He says his name.
See that's what I'm saying.
As part of his plan.
He's not there.
That's wrong.
And there was no one there to help me.
Why'd you want to help us?
Can I ask you something Mr.
It's what you are.
And remember me as a friend.
No that door over there.
What's it all about?
How'd he do?
How does that feel?
That was a test?
And you're wrong if you think I'd turn my back on a friend.
You I can work with.
What do you mean what kind of person?
He's a good person.
Look at that woman.
She's what?
I'd like to live in that place.
Seventy-five percent.
Do you believe that?
Every once in a while some cat comes to me.
He wants to know how I made it.
Hold it like this.
They take that into account.
We think Mr.
Let me see it.
No I know.
I'm just saying.
I was just asking.
Give him a second.
Let's keep it --
It was stupid.
Let's not even talk about it.
I got to be pretty good.
It took six months of research.
The whole school was shut down.
I know it must of been a bad experience.
You just got to stick with it.
It takes a long time to learn this game.
It's like having two little kids in the car.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
He said that.
But it really kind of does.
It could happen.
How do you say nineteen?
Where'd they come from?
Get back in position!
Did he see us?
He's probably got his own room.
What's he doing here?
We might have to take that chance.
The one and only Little Richard.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Wait a second --
Do they let you --
Do you have your own room?
That's just what the DA asked.
Who's watching the door?
Get back in position.
It looks pretty good.
There's nobody back here.
How's it look back there?
I know it man.
We want you on the job.
You had your brother.
I never agreed to that.
I just want us to --
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
What you been up to?
You know why?
He's Future Man.
But I care about you.
This is stupid.
I know it's not.
It's my car!
Not in that car you're not.
Well obviously we got to go back.
What do you mean get back?
We'll have to see when we get back.
How long has he been in there?
What do you use it for?
That could be anybody's.
I mean what do they actually have on Future Man?
But it's not his.
See you in a little while.
Are you coming?
I'm sure he did.
There were more than that.
But why take the chance?
I told you they were there.
You really think he'll remember you?
How much is there?
Make that light.
Did we get it?
Keep it at forty.
I paid for it.
What's your fucking problem?
I just want to look at it for a minute.
That's my responsibility.
The money and the people.
Let's just go.
Maybe she turned.
Look at her.
I know that now.
What did I say?
You should take a look.
As much as I want.
I'll just drive my car.
That never would of --
I'm not allowed to drive those.
What about one of those?
I might have mentioned it.
I went out of town.
Your brother was up here the other day.
I'm trying.
And what does that cover?
How long do you have to go?
This is your job.
I want you to try this.
Well I think --
Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Is he good?
Is he in?
This is no good.
Good to see you.
What can we do?
Why did he go that way?
That's his section.
Well I left some money in there.
Come on in!
How's the weather down there?
She is a good looking woman.
Where's your friend?
Got a little lucky.
No my friend knows her.
I just have short hair.
Hello my friend.
Good to know you John.
How are you.
He left yesterday on the night train.
He's probably just getting in now.
She's done everything I wanted.
I'll say.
Well you're probably right.
You lost your way.
Had to be done.
It was just money.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I have to call his family.
Did he say anything to you?
So what's he doing?
You believe him?
And what about her?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
And you do?
I've already got a team there.
The man is dead.
May I finish?
Do you know what his budget was?
I think I do.
Where's he now?
It had to be done.
It went wrong.
I want to know what happened.
Is that it?
To know about it?
Black on black.
Not around here.
And what are we looking for?
Never heard of it.
Show me again...
I had to tell you right?
Who else knows about this?
Lots of people...
She say what time I should call?
Is this really happening?
I have to go now.
You know I'm not.
Your life is hard enough.
how can you be here and say this?
It was my job.
My first time.
I had to change my plan.
You understand me?
That's not what happened to your parents.
It changes things.
I would want to know.
No I do.
It's just a picture.
Does this picture mean anything to you?
That's why I came here.
Have the chair.
-- take the back -- get another car --
How long do I have --
You called it in?
She really did that?
I had a woman once.
But after a while what do you talk about?
I mean for us.
If it's over why are they after me?
Dead the night you walked out.
He's dead.
I like it here.
You still should've moved.
Felt a little light.
You know exactly what to do.
God I miss you.
It might have.
But you found another choice.
Tell me later.
I love you too.
There's no choice.
There must be another way!
What if it's not who you think it is?
I'll meet you there in an hour.
-- it's just him?
--  -- is he back there?
-- where's left to go?
I'll come back.
but you're not -- you're not sure...
This is real.
And he's right there...
But you're sure?
But we were so careful.
One day it will be different.
It just takes time.
You are better.
I should be better by now.
I worry when you get like this.
I do remember something good.
All the time.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!
You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse?
We should still -- we should write it down.
There's nothing new.
I'll get the book.
In the car.
I was here!
My first job.
I did a job here.
So when was I here?
Why are you here then?
WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
You fucking people.
They know it's you!
And you got to him before we could.
I want to hear it from you.
What is this a game?
How do they know that?
How can they know any of that?
They know you were here.
I told them...
Get on it.
Do you think you can read?
Are you well enough?
Give her your phone.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Okay how do you want to do it?
I want to come in.
take it down.
I want to look at the room.
Check it out.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
We need to get in there.
-- just shut the --
-- no other people!
-- who else is here?
Is all there.
This is everything?
He's real.
That's where we came out.
Is that clear??
Where do we stand?
It's a start.
Let's give him half an hour.
He was sick.
He wanted out.
Is he coming in?
He's coming for us.
And why is that?
Whatever he's doing we need to end it.
You mean did I want a date?
You felt nothing?
Life and death?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something.
Not good enough.
Ever feel sorry for him?
For what he'd been through?
Look what do you want me to say?
I was there.
Am I a doctor no but...
You're coming with us.
What kind of problems?
And what about you anything?
In that order.
Here's what I've got.
He never did.
Yeah that'll work...
What the hell was he doing here?
Do we know what this says?
So please -- do it.
What are they doing?
But it happened.
You'll come home with me.
He has already agreed to come.
So I tell you this is what we face.
what will you do?
I know he will.
That is another matter.
And how is your father?
We have missed him at the council.
It will be worse than before!
He is gone!
What choice do they have?
And you have done nothing?!
What news of the north?
If you wish to take him I know a way.
I had thought that...
Perhaps I am.
I said LOOK AT ME!
Shut up would you!
So I did!
And what was so important about it?
One of us is enough.
I want to live!
I've asked god for those things.
We know that.
This is the only way.
We're here to stay.
Thanks for the food and drink.
Fourteen feet long.
I'll wait...
Good to see you again.
I will not.
You'll move
That depends on the man.
I still say this is no test.
Aye we'll get 'em.
Three maybe more!
They're coming!
All right Father I'll ask him!
All men lose heart.
Let her speak.
This is what happens when you must send a woman.
What kind of man is he?
Then why does he stay?
He did not.
I will deal with him.
Where is my son?
It's only been a day.
I've missed you.
I will be with you like this.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I want to be yours and you mine.
Every night like this one.
I'm not just saying it!
Did it work?
You've been here before?
And I'll come again.
It's not you.
He just says...
I need you so much!
And I with you.
I want to stay with you.
How do you know this?
It will be awful!
In time who knows what can happen if you can only live.
Or simply love me...
More than one.
you have a husband.
The same way...
as when we met.
Why did you?
It does me good to see you.
And only you would know I would be aware of it.
She was my wife.
about your woman.
That is not possible.
I have been given nothing.
God makes men what they are.
But now that I am here will you speak with a woman?
I see it.
I know it.
I am trying.
But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own.
We need you.
Our people know you.
And so would I.
I want what you want!
We all end up dead.
It's only a question of how.
But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself.
Now what do we do?
Who would do such a thing?
Someone must have given it to them.
There is one more thing Mrs.
I'll take care of it.
Can I have the picture?
I'm already late for work --
I need to speak with you!
So what did you find.
But he's seven.
But you must have something to go on?
And the bad news?
Just have him write down everything he does.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend.
Like your father.
I never even got the chance to write it.
How much time have I got?
I told you I need them all!
I found these.
She all right?
These things take time.
How long will I be in here?
What could he do?
When he was around your age...
almost exactly your age.
People will talk.
Something must've happened!
What set him off?
What were you doing with that?
I'll see you soon.
You'll like him.
Please can we go?
But I'm not so bad am I?
We've been over this a hundred times.
You know the answer to that.
can dad come this time?
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
What did it look like?
For you to help me.
When they come just put your mind in another place man.
Be somewhere else.
I need those books.
Not even with my father?
It's coming...
I see a car.
Then go a little forward in time.
What do you see now?
Where are you now?
You know my father?
It's very nice to meet you.
Are you stupid or what?
This is bigger.
Seven years to the day.
Then you think it might have worked out?
I never knew that.
So then you still sometimes think of us...
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Do you ever think about ""us?
"" I mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Is something the matter?
Take me back!
You've already done so much for me.
I'm over it.
Off to change everyone's life again is that it?
I just thought you should know.
Then forget that.
I'm the only person you've told?
That's a great line.
I never thought you would.
What's happened to you?
I've been where you've been.
Nice to see you too.
Now's the only time!
It's not the time.
Something's not right.
It's just that...
Even the dinner tonight.
It was beautiful but...
You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's beautiful.
You'll see.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you.
Oh my God that was good.
Well I remember he had one...
but he like put it away after the first day.
Those are your clothes silly.
where are my clothes?
Nothing ever gets better!
No but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Is that why you came all the way back?
I know but...
It was a long time ago.
When we were kids.
I'll try to remember.
It'd be a big help.
She had a new family.
Not enough space for me.
Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids.
Not if you remember my dad.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Not since we were kids.
Fill me in.
I never thought I'd see you again.
How've you been?
He must be.
He knows I'm moving away right?
All they do is make you feel like shit.
Your dad did this?
This was a bad idea.
What's happened to you!
what did we do?
So let's go.
We should go soon.
Been there done that.
Who -- who are you?
Nice work daddy.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Where did we all go?
It must end with me.
There is no ""right"".
You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
We'll find out soon enough.
Hey I got no choice.
And how's your project coming?
Come on go on...
Now read me something.
He's so...
What do you need it for?
So we'll see.
Yeah good what else do you remember?
Can I have this?
I can change this.
I did what you said man!
Get this ""us"" shit.
What's wrong with you?!
Look what you made me do!
Where are we?!
It's here somewhere.
What's up already?
Hey what'd you do that for?
Never heard of her.
I come from a big family.
Oh my God oh my God...
Where the hell are you taking us anyway?
You are silly.
I thought I was the bad guy!
Maybe it went out.
Should someone check it?
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Yours may work out.
He is such a boy.
In many ways I am so much older than he is.
You want my advice?
-- Will he keep his word?
And you want to know --
Does he know that?
Yes I'll bet.
It was much more than we thought to get here.
He wants to help us.
I thought so.
Where's your husband?
-- Now just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?
Is his word --
Oh he's just like any other man only more so.
Do you mind if I do?
Will you have a drink?
My husband is with me too.
I should have known.
How did you get in here?
You're under age.
Could I speak to you for just a moment please?
But we who are still free will do all we can.
If you would come...
As you see it was true every single time.
He is supposed to help me.
But that is your decision?
What is your name?
-- Then perhaps for the lady.
You will find a market there for this ring.
Yes I come I will do it.
Yes I come.
Come up here a minute.
The police break up our meeting.
Oh two weeks maybe three.
That's all right.
Er my check please.
Here's to you sir.
I shall remember to pay it...
Of course they stay.
I happen to know that he gets ten percent.
But he's worth twenty- five.
That still goes.
You're a lucky man.
It's certainly not good enough.
Well you're in good company.
I think you know where those letters are.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
So could I.
Here sit down.
I never drink in the morning.
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.
I see the bus is in.
Suppose we do.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
One never knows what he'll do or why.
But it is worth a chance.
Do you know where they are?
But be careful.
I will stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while --
You however are a different matter.
You see my dear the word has gone around.
What are they?
What value is that?
She tried everything to get them and nothing worked.
And you never will.
But I've got a job to do too.
And I said I would never leave you.
We got it back last night.
But what about us?
Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life.
-- You've got to listen to me.
But Richard no I I --
-- Last night we said a great many things.
You said I was to do the thinking for both of us.
No Richard no.
What has happened to you?
Last night we said --
But why my name Richard?
Everything is quite all right.
All right I will.
You'll have to think for both of us for all of us.
You'll see that he gets out?
Then he'll have his work all that he's been living for.
What about now?
He was sick he needed me.
well well you know the rest.
For months I tried to get word.
Then it came.
I had nothing.
Not even hope.
Then I met you.
All right I'll make it easier for you.
For the last time put them on the table.
Put them on the table.
I've got them right here.
I tried to reason with you.
I tried everything.
Now I want those letters.
Get them for me.
What of it?
Oh Richard I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but but you you are our last hope.
You'd say anything now to get what you want.
Please listen to me.
If those days meant anything at all to you --
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is?
I went through all that with your husband.
It's no deal.
You can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters.
You use ""Richard"" again?
Richard I had to see you.
How did you get in?
You'll be there.
Well I'm not running away any more.
You can believe that if you want to.
Last night I saw what has happened to you.
He'd understand.
Well you can tell me now.
Why did you come back?
Yes that's very pretty.
I heard a story once.
Tell me, who was it you left me for?
Well, go on, tell it.
Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Well, I did.
Every one of them.
You understand how I feel.
I can understand how you feel.
I can still hear it.
Richard dear I'll go with you any place.
We'll get on a train together and never stop.
There are other places.
I love you so much and I hate this war so much.
Anything can happen.
Well why not?
Well let's see.
At a quarter to five.
Yes of course we --
We must leave.
But be serious darling.
I know so very little about you.
Looking for a job.
Ten years ago?
Where were you say ten years ago?
Richard they'll find out your record.
Well only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I'm sorry for asking.
That's easy.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Why I'm so lucky.
Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
We said ""no questions.
Who are you really?
And what were you before?
What did you do and what did you think?
Not an easy day to forget.
Play ""As Time Goes By.
Oh he never...
He goes up there all the time.
Does he always leave so early?
Not tonight no more.
When will he be back?
Yes I'm ready.
Of course I'll be careful.
I'll believe.
Yes Yes I know.
I love you very much my dear.
Is there anything you wish to tell me?
He said ""Ask your wife.
Did he give any reason?
Apparently he has the letters.
Whatever I'd say you'd carry on.
Could we have a table close to him?
I meant to but something always held me up.
Yes I see.
Yes I would.
This time they really mean to stop me.
You are very kind.
You're saying this only to make me go.
Let's see the last time we met --
-- This is Mr.
Well then perhaps you also ---
Here it is.
There's something you should know before you leave.
Everything in order?
Oh never mind about that.
But we made a deal.
Oh save it.
We've still lots of things to do.
You love her that much?
I ask only one thing.
I wonder if you do.
Yes I get the point.
Had a close one eh?
I said ask your wife.
I suggest that you ask your wife.
The problems of the world are not in my department.
You know what I have been doing.
You see here we are again.
We'll come again.
We all try.
Are you quite finished with us?
I am making out the report now.
Nothing important but may I speak to him now?
Did you have a good night's rest?
So it is.
What is it you want?
For the time being.
You will give us the names?
And that is?
You have all the time in the world.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Is it your order that we come to your office?
Then we shall state another time and another place.
Why do you stand here?
Yes much too good a time.
But everybody's having such a good time.
You see what I mean?
I see what you mean.
I have been thinking.
And if it should change?
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
And that takes in the field of women too.
How about New York?
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Especially so tonight Major.
What else my dear Major?
It's very good to be here.
I think perhaps you're right.
Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start.
I know a little about women my friend.
Well I was right.
And the names are Mr.
I suppose you know what you're doing but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Sit down over there.
Not for a while yet.
I have the letters right here.
Is everything ready?
You're late.
You get him and we get away.
It certainly would.
And I'm taking a friend with me.
I I get the point.
Well they're all excellent reasons.
You might as well let him go now.
How can you close me up?
Well it looks like you're a little late.
I'm very pleased with you.
This has been a very interesting evening.
Oh it's my party.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Oh how do you do?
Yeah you were saying?
Oh I see.
I have seen the lady.
He'll take one.
Make it ten.
I just paid out twenty.
I'd like to get it back.
Oh but I just told you.
That is another reason.
As a matter of fact I wanted to give you a word of advice.
You would like to be on it?
Take your hands off me!
Fill it up.
Give me another.
Will I see you tonight?
Put that phone down!
Who do you think will win the war?
Please keep them for me.
Will you keep these for me?
I found myself much more reasonable.
I get it for them for half.
That's not so bad.
If I gave you any thought I probably would.
You never drink with...
I'll have another please.
Will you have a drink with me please?
They got a lucky break.
-- You thought what?
Have you seen her?
We'll never finish the other three.
You said it!
If she can stand it I can.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well stop it.
You know what I want to hear.
Just a little something of my own.
What's that you're playing?
Well that's the way it goes.
One in one out.
Shut up and go home will you?
We'll take the car and drive all night.
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.
I'm waiting for a lady.
Then have a drink.
Not right now.
He'll double what I pay you.
I like it fine here.
Then we've just got shit.
We do the best we can that's all we have.
The next day we just start over again.
It's real.
Enough about me.
They'll never see you.
They'll be back.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Thank you God.
Yeah sure what?
Other people get through a lot worse.
I'm lost.
They'd eat you if they could.
You're beautiful.
Water water water --
I'm putting it off.
Maybe I'm too far south.
No more water you said.
No water no work.
You've had today's water.
Save some for tomorrow.
Just sit here I'll get us some lunch.
that was the last one.
Well not really I --
I -- I -- They are...
You've tried?
A long time ago.
Want to come in?
As much as anybody.
You know what happened to this?
You never gave up.
No wonder it's so late.
I've got lots of time.
Yeah a long one.
Must be a story there.
I had to come.
To be sure you were okay.
It means a lot...
that you came.
What will you do?
No one back here does.
Busy every minute.
Not when you have no choice.
So simple to say so hard to do.
Live each day like it's your last.
You know how I hate that.
My friends died.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
My second one.
About half a cup a day.
Can you believe it?
You have any children?
It just happened.
He took care of everything.
He took care of me.
I would have done the same thing.
I would never --
I thought you might have.
A few things came up.
Or went down.
Right back you said you'd be right back.
it's okay!
We'll be fine.
Be who you are right now.
No it was great.
I got a little carried away.
It's our dog.
That's your dog.
You want to.
But I have to go.
I wanted a ring.
And for you --
Hey look at you.
Ah the staff meeting could have gone better.
Yeah tell me.
Tell me all of it.
That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?
Let's take a look.
Hey be nice to it it'll be nice to you.
And how was your Christmas?
I just want out of here.
Yes yes he did.
I most definitely say I am.
If you say you are.
But all that's behind me.
I'm fine now.
I am one lucky guy.
I used to drive one of those.
You bet I do.
Need some help?
Let's eat.
I lived by it.
This is my home.
I've got all this back pay coming.
I wanted to come here.
When'd you start working here?
I'm doing fine.
Maybe I should take a few days off.
Look I help take care of the place.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Can you find her?
Let's run a current check.
Can you hear us?
Finish what you started.
It's still you.
I need to do it.
That's what we do.
Not just that.
Take your time.
That's what it's about.
Believe me I know.
That's all there is.
You've been over the line and you came back.
I never thought it would end.
Then it did.
Forty-three days.
You were how long on this?
Time I had lots of.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
How about we go somewhere else?
I'm most definitely not dead.
You're fucking dead!
We're on.
Talk is cheap.
Are we on or not?
Ninety five percent?
Just give me the money now.
I'm trying to help you here.
For the third time.
And never take.
You know what your problem is?
I got it working...
You have no idea how hard it was...
But I might not have.
It was fifteen minutes late.
No please join me.
Oh my yes!
What has the law done for any of us here?
You've completely made his up!
One has to be more than ""careful"" of Mrs.
It's that Mrs.
He could use some clothes.
He's still a boy--out in the world he's still a boy.
Oh just stop it!
He's a young man.
Let him try to *make* some money!
He'll need clothes...
Some new *things* would be useful.
How beautiful you were!
Life is waiting.
Only if you can afford it.
She's just an...
Better than I can!
What would you do if you met them?
But sometimes I wish I could meet mine anyway.
I know who you mean.
I mean your parents.
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm *not* a doctor.
He has to.
I've seen him do it!
Good night Daddy.
Good night kids.
Daddy it's a letter to *me*.
No I'm the one who should be sorry.
This came for you a couple of days ago.
Do you think she'll be all right?
You say that as though it's some awful thing!
that's enough.
well for a while anyway.
No that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
What do you want me to *do*?
I know I'm sorry.
You got up!
You *did* something!
Just cut it out!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing!
Of course not!
Let's just sit here all night!
Nothing is nothing.
Is *that* nothing.
I'm afraid to see him too.
I'll do whatever you want to do.
He's the *father*!
He's her baby's father!
It's her father...
It's her decision.
Well we have to help her!
I told her!
Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Okay okay--I know you do too.
That's not all there is to it!
I love you too--I *know* I do.
That's all there is to it then.
So we should ""wait and see.
"" For how long?
Do you think I'm having a good time?
I'm just waiting and seeing.
You might have told me yourself.
We have to wait and see.
I think that for *everything* in life you have to wait and see.
*What* will be okay?
It will be okay.
Do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay?
I *know* this was right.
That's what *I'd* come here for.
So what is that--a radio?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I miss things.
Maybe I was.
I love this place!
You were born to drive a car like this.
She *did* love him!
How many women have you known?
I *did* like it.
It's really good.
I've only seen one though.
yes I'm fine.
It's all very...
different for me...
I'll see you around.
Thanks for everything.
No but I work there--I like it.
How many months are you?
I know where you can go.
Yes I *have*!
I've been through this.
Oh he's fine!
I just heard from him.
I know what you've been doing.
See you tomorrow.
No--keep it down.
I want to feel the air.
Should I put the top up?
It might get cold.
I'm okay--I can walk.
So many children.
You mean somebody asked?
Nobody's asked for me have they?
Nobody ever wants me!
They wanted a girl.
I thought they might take me.
Does he even *want* to come back?
I just wanted to ask you...
They *are* against the law.
*That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
How old are you dear?
She looks after other people's children.
She's dead now too.
Did you know your mother better?
But did you know him?
Is *your* father dead?
Is that soon?
His father's dead right?
No you did it yourself.
*I'm* the lucky one.
that's good then.
All I mean is I'm lucky I met you.
It's all very normal.
There's a *war*!
This is all normal.
It'll take a little time.
I need a job.
Actually someone did.
No it's not serious.
you're not...
I mean do *you* do the--
They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Let me hear you say that!
Where'd she get you?
Then you can be of use.
What's it called?
If you want I can help you.
Please listen to me!
*Both* of you...
And I *love* her!
Go on cut my clothes.
I've got other clothes.
How can you...
Is that possible?
They is *good* for you!
Are we supposed to be up here?
I can tell you got yourself some education.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war I suppose.
What should I do now?
I am not a doctor.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
In other parts of the world I suppose there are other ways.
Try to look at it *this* way.
Try to look at it this way.
How about this child?
I'll get this.
I thought it was my turn.
I thought you took care of this.
You do it then.
He's a boy That's why.
It's my turn!
But you *will*.
And you call yourself ""not a doctor""!
In every life you've got to be of use.
Yes for both.
What I mean is...
you could move on with *us* man!
I'd like to go with you.
But I've got to move on.
That's *it*?
You know I mean to yourself.
I can take care of it myself!
keep the baby I know a place where you can go.
Whatever you want to do I can help you.
How am I supposed to take care of a baby!
I know more than I want to know about it.
Who's the father?
What do you know about it?
You're not yet three months are you?
Give men that.
I know how to do it.
Yeah you is.
I know when people is in trouble and you is.
I'm not in trouble.
Do you like to read?
Yes so what.
It's nothing serious really.
There's a little something wrong with it.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
It's just my heart.
Just tell me what your business is...
He's a good boy.
Do you know him?
When will he be home Major?
that's correct.
Look at this one!
That's what we say all right.
I told him that you all is sick.
Yeah we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Please let me go.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
What's lucky about that?
She took off in the night!
Well thanks for the drink.
Wish we had met eight hours ago.
I work in a bank.
Thanks for playing along.
I just have to sit for a while.
But I'm not that late.
Of how much?
Then there it is.
No I understand that.
What I mean...
What I'm trying to say...
Well my cut.
I already told you.
Everything looks in order.
The bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works.
Have you ever heard of a company called Big.
Yeah we got that part.
Taking a chance like that.
And that was it.
That's when we decided to start our own business.
I told you I'd get it.
Yeah but come on...
Like putting on a play...
Started off great...
What happened today?
We were back on.
Yes it is!
They were right there for you.
She was right there for you!
It's not true.
I was doing it for them.
Was it love?
They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Believe it all.
Especially the bad.
It's getting cold.
That was it.
Now we needed the Mark.
What do they get?
I'm not saying anything.
That's not a bad place to start.
Just the last three weeks.
What makes you say that?
And how much did you say you wanted for this...
What did you call it?
Go down to the bar.
If they pull it off great.
So we go to the bar.
Now that'll be something.
We double our money.
What do you want us to do about it?
Anybody want in?
Jesus I almost felt sorry for the guy.
The red hair...
It's never worked.
Is this the best thing to do?
The whole thing took about two and a half hours.
That's how good he is.
Let me tell you how good this guy is.
That's it?
We can still do this!
We just stay clear of him.
What bank are you with?
So that's it...
You'll be there?
Three or four times over.
She's up for it.
She up for this?
This is New York city Sister.
Let's do the list...
No not ""whatever.
"" You're either in or you're out.
We pay better.
We get fifty percent.
Then they'll start looking for us too.
You know what we're doing with the money.
It gets worse.
That much and we never had to put him on the ""Send?
Well this is just fucking great...
It can buy you a new and better you.
He's not coming back.
He came up with it pretty quick.
I can feel you looking at me.
I'm good.
No you listen.
Taken out of our cut when we're done.
What do you need from me?
I think two million.
You ask a lot of questions.
Let me see 'em.
You tried it once.
I love it!
I'll get the money back plus interest.
You get a cat I get a cut.
Then there's you...
Of course your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I like the idea of that.
It's all take take take.
You guy's pretty good?
Here and there.
It was him.
We get a big piece.
I remember now.
I like you boys.
But what can I say?
It's a check.
Very much so.
Take it from me you never do.
Here of all places!
How is Mrs.
We met once or twice.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
What -- What do we do?
LISTEN to me!
It went to shit.
It happens sometimes.
I had to!
You saw what he was doing right?
You heard him!
That's what happened!
I lost my head.
No I want my cut!
You sold me out.
It's happening.
For your cut I mean.
I want you to have it.
It should have been you.
There is no cut.
So there it is.
It's all about the fucking money.
What about the money?
What about what?
He will be on this until the end of time.
Three or four times.
Shit what was that guy's name?
He was looking out for you.
What the hell was his name?
We were friends.
I was only fifteen.
But he was a nice guy.
Not the way I did it.
I actually did have a real job once.
I SAID HOW DO --  Deal with that?
How do you deal with --
Like a baby's.
How do you know I will?
You have another part?
You'll know what to do.
So that was my part?
But I knew you would.
It's more than that.
So why this?
It's what I do.
It's my job.
I think you'd do it for free.
Look at you...
You want to go.
Did I miss something?
What about this?
Do you have any idea what this means?
We're dead!
You told me to change my hair!
Then show me how.
And some new clothes.
What the hell's his problem?
Hey I got it!
You just might learn something here.
Just play a part.
What's my cut?
What do you want me for anyway?
We had to see what your deal was.
You got the job.
We have work.
It's not that kind of work.
You interested in a little work?
That's not --
And we got rid of the red head.
We hit every green light.
Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
No no no!
Not this time.
I am doing this for your own good!
You get it?
Where the hell is she?
I'm getting clear of this.
We're getting a little old for running.
Yes we have.
And we would have been beautiful about it.
Yeah well we never had this kind of problem before.
We never had a problem with that before.
Then what do you want to do Miles?
Wait a second...
The police will be here any second.
Meet me at my place later.
I know where it is.
That will be fine.
Do we want insurance?
I'm just asking...
He'll find us.
We go talk to him.
We'll meet up anywhere.
Look what they did to him.
You sure we're clear?
Then shut up.
If not shut up.
I know it's policy but...
The thing is...
It's a very very special night for my wife and I.
I can send you I.
Is there any way..?
That's no problem.
A ring for my wife.
A lot like that one.
In fact it was that one.
But if you're into her...
Keep it up.
What's up with you?
Maybe he's got it right.
You believe this?
Let me ask you something...
Oh you know...
Give us a point.
It's business.
I'll find the time.
Here's the thing...
I want to get out from under all this for good.
So what do you want?
It's not history.
So then I figure what's worth that?
Who's the Mark?
Try and keep up...
She's alright.
In over your head?
You into something big?
So do half the other people in this place.
How do I know which one?
Is he close?
Consider him a part of me.
We're here.
What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Did he buy it?
You guy's are not working with me here.
So what do you have for me?
What do you get out of it?
Whatever he's into next I want you to be into.
And what you're into I'm into.
He sent me a birthday card.
In fact I've only met the guy once.
But now now I have you.
The next best thing.
Put your hand down.
I'm down!
That's what I'm talking about.
It's just insurance.
I want to see it right in front of my face.
There he is.
You think this is a good idea?
You sell it.
Who was that on the phone?
It was positive.
As you knew.
You fucking little shit!
Now he's a real shit.
I'm sure he's got his hand in the till.
You know what he said to me once?
It's none of my business.
It's just that you're not like the others.
Ah we all say that.
But if we hate it why do we do it?
I've been watching you work.
You're the best in the place.
But you know that.
Well it is.
But I know where I am.
I'll take you up on that.
Maybe another time.
Is it that bad?
I'm in business.
How about five hundred.
How about fifteen hundred?
What's the Blue Book price?
What kind of deal you looking to?
She had to leave early.
She asked me to thank you.
And your lady?
Good God no.
I've got an idea.
It's nothing to do with money.
It's only a few quid.
Who was he?
I found her in bed with someone.
I'll try and make it.
It's near Oxford.
It'll just be social.
Bring a friend.
I've plenty of room.
I thought it was you.
It's the hair!
You might get two maybe three in a week.
Can you live on sixty pounds?
I'll call you back.
We all played the field.
Three years two months.
I want to buy a car.
I hate public transport.
Why did you take the money?
Or I'll shop you.
All you have to do is keep your word.
It's that simple.
Nothing about you.
What did you tell the police?
How did you know I was here?
I can just imagine being around so much money all the time...
Within a month.
It's none of my business what you write.
And your job that's none of my business either.
And I've done everything wrong.
But not with you.
The book is yours not mine.
I was wrong what I said about it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
There's no hope in it.
It's a book.
Is that the way you feel now?
Is that what's happened to you?
Now he's in control.
I'm on at nine.
Make it nine and you're on.
What about a drink on the way home?
What do I mean to you?
This fucking job's getting to you.
I take it back.
Take that back!
Fucking take that back.
I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
It's only hair.
It'll go.
How did it go?
What's the time?
You've got such beautiful hands.
There's no third thing.
You sold the car.
You got a job.
What's the third thing?
I start Monday week.
You never told me that.
I had training.
It came my way.
How did you land that?
I've got a job.
I want to hear it.
I've got something to tell you.
Of course they will.
Take it back.
Till you sell your book.
It's only a car.
I can get another.
I know what it meant to you.
sold the car.
Where did you get it?
You really are a beautiful woman.
I'm not ready for you.
I've just started a new company.
So how are you doing dad?
All right dad.
Yes I'll call him.
Have you written that name down?
I've set this up for you.
Give yourself a break.
Well I've got something for you.
In London I mean.
Found a job?
I'm all over that now.
There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Would you like a drink?
And your hand too.
I've still got mine.
The date's not set yet.
I need the money too.
Well life's not fair.
Is it yes?
I have to take the car.
No forget it.
Wait a minute...
I want you to forget what I said.
I'm asking you as a...
You've done your research.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after.
That's the point.
What ten thousand pounds?
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
But if it does.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I've come to know you.
You're honest.
And I thought you were only after my body.
You're serious.
And that's when it'll happen.
It'll never work.
Who's they?
They mean it.
But you can now.
What kind of trouble?
I'm in trouble.
Which side do you like?
I'll watch.
That's fine.
Before we get there.
I must go.
Let me pay for this.
I come every couple of years.
I just like this bar.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Well thank you anyway.
I've lived there.
You know where I'm from?
Turn left at the lights.
Happy New Year.
The pressure's too much believe me it'll break you.
And the girls?
It's the system.
If I see you do it again I'll report it.
You've got it wrong.
Some other time.
I need my eight hours.
You've done pretty well.
Coming up to two years now.
But I was away for six months.
She's my baby.
So how do you feel your first night?
I'll bet you're on a high.
Have you got transport?
It was you you shit.
I'm afraid that's not so sir.
I put them on together.
With this lady.
I'm sorry sir that's a late bet.
Three if you need it.
We'll pay you sick leave.
You're a good man.
But what could I do?
Thanks for the information.
I can see.
Does he win?
I just want the job.
That hair will have to go.
You can start Monday week.
Let me show you something.
We'd know.
Or does report?
Believe me someone always does.
Let me just run through a few things.
We'll need your picture.
I said good call.
You want me to check?
What makes you so sure?
I make it six.
And not three or five?
We check every four days.
That's middle of the road.
Private I suppose.
They know your father.
Sit down John.
I think he's talking to it.
There she is.
What's wrong now?
I read the same here.
Remember what we found?
Nothing at all in this sector.
What do you have for us now.
Time to start talking.
Well then everything sounds fine.
Check at six minutes.
Okay I have six minutes exactly.
Does that check out down there?
Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
There's no reason for it.
That is correct.
And you can only do it once right?
Why that would mean...
Well I think therefore I am.
This is an order.
I'm coming in now.
Any of 'em any good?
Eight it says here.
In a second.
I'll check it.
It's coming right by me.
They may see you coming down.
Nothing we can do about it now.
Hey it looks like...
He made it.
Here I am.
I'm coming.
Let me know if anything important comes up.
I wish I had my board with me now.
Might be something important.
We'll find out when it goes bad.
Hit that water.
It's funny but I kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself...
Nobody knows why.
Never heard of 'em.
You'll have plenty of time for that you know.
I like it up here.
You spend too much time up here.
what happened men?
We're running out of time sir.
Are you still there?
I'll have it again in a minute.
I forget so many things in here so many things.
Hold on just a minute let me think...
Well what you might try is --
What should we do sir?
The time is running out.
That's correct sir.
What's that sir?
It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Ah there's something serious come up sir and I have to ask you something.
How I make my living what's your point?
I can explain...
None of your business.
or should I say not taking care of it.
But see it's really the other way around.
That's not why we're here.
So call her.
Get her over here.
we could go on a date.
Stand on your own two feet know what I mean?
Probably not anyway.
Yeah sure I understand.
Now that that's out of the way...
You want the woman here's how it works.
I'm on a break.
He wants you to come see him.
You know each other?
Could you give us a moment.
You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
She was there...
But I'm afraid of--
I live here...
Yeah well around here I'm the Most High...
Which is none of your business...
I'll make it worth your while.
Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
What're you looking for?
Same old story.
Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
It was a present from a guy.
What's with you?
Yeah me too.
I made you coffee.
What else can we do?
Look I'd really like to...
Can you help me get her back?
then Peter told me to run.
And then he...
and I remember so clearly thinking it's me they want.
If I run maybe they'll come after me.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
He made it...
That was taken nine years ago...
With your help.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
You are involved.
Look thank you for this but--
I need your help.
It turned up on the black market.
Once and for all.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen I just know they do.
Which you did...
You believe that?
Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Somebody's got to.
That's what you were put here for.
They want me...
More likely it's a long drive out in the country if you know what I mean.
What's in it for you?
You said you could help.
I know they made me.
How much do you know?
I remember fine.
I never knew how many made it.
I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
You did go through my stuff.
The other one like you...
The other ones?
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
You always come on this strong?
No I meant this.
You need to get out more.
But I had to see you.
We are not fine.
It's alright Peter we're fine.
We've been through all this.
That would be appropriate yes.
So saw my hands off I left you a present.
Completely different situation.
It was open.
Look around at all this...
Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.
How does Mrs.
Too early to tell.
Now you know who I am where I live.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Sorry about your window.
First time I ever heard that.
I'll wait.
Any idea when she'll be back?
I need to talk to her.
But she does work here?
Know where I can find her?
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Say the words ""I understand.
Let go of my hand.
Not him and certainly not you.
Standing by your man even after what he did.
Well it's over between you and him.
And so should you.
And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
Who is it?
Just give it to me.
I'll remember.
Just do it...
Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
You and me both.
And why do I think they're looking for you?
How's this about me?
Here's your money.
I'll live...
As long as you're okay.
What about the other kids?
You get anything on them?
Only a last name would be nice.
She must've lived near there somewhere near the...
Maybe if you could give me something more on her...
That's all I got.
He says he got it from a woman.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...
Who's this guy?
Sorry I was seven at the time.
I got a hit on the car.
It's client.
Now you got something for me or not?
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Only one I can think of.
And back at ya.
Only there's a part of you that's...
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right?
A long time.
How long you and me known each other?
You know what I'm saying.
A little what?
That's odd...
You get it when I get her.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
She's got my word.
Make the call.
And she bought that?
So how do you get the woman to come to me?
I actually know how this works.
Not right now?
I'll bet you can.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Tell everybody hey.
What if he's on the level?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Did you see that one guy--
Okay okay okay--
She was the one--
How'd you get her out of town?
One I'll never ever make again.
She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.
And why should she?
What happens if you level with her?
She's as much as said so.
Does this person have a name?
Hear me out.
Here it comes.
But there's another side--
I know what you're thinking.
As a matter of fact after what she just did she's not even someone I like much.
Right the big one-oh.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.
For a change.
He's sick.
I want you on call here.
I was on call.
This is a hot run.
More than anything in the world.
No I mean...
you love your son?
You love him?
Obviously no one you have to worry about...
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
You're too kind.
She like 'em young.
And since you look a little new at this let me give you three words of advice.
Hard to get.
Think it act it know it be it.
Sure I have.
Yeah a man's drink...
Soon as we get a phone.
Church will never be the same again.
Let's not think about the past.
Let's just think about from today on.
That'd be great.
It's a college town you know?
We're moving.
I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you.
Anyway open the box.
Hey how'd you know that?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What's it worth to you?
Plenty but it was all bad.
we'll meet over there.
at twenty-thirty hours.
I have one question.
His name was...
No simply similar...
's name again?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school!
What are you high?
We're running out of time here.
I never should have let you drive man!
Now listen up.
Here's the game plan.
Alright here's the plan.
Never mind with the too bad shit.
Second floor girls' john!
He'll never look there!
Yeah she gives you shit and you take it.
That's not the problem...
The easy way.
Sorry man no can do.
I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
You're not allowed to speak remember?
I know how we can get in!
Just show us.
Okay we're here we got nothing and we got an hour and a half.
I thought it was a nice thing to do.
We can pick them up after school.
It's no problem.
They're what?
Of course but has that ever stopped me before?
I'm really sorry about that man.
Please tell me you have'm!
What's gone?
Anyway listen up.
They're gone!
He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
I said I'm sorry!
What else can I do?
What's wrong with what I got on?
Oh this is terrible...
Please go on.
Alright Father here it is.
And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either.
a really long time.
All I got is five.
What happened to it?
It's gone.
Well here we are back at fucking school again.
Wait till Mrs.
I did it!
Hey take it easy man.
That's some sick shit right there.
No question Mrs.
Please let me get him for you.
A likely story.
Stay on the line so we can get your full name information and...
Thank you God!
Yeah you did!
Is that your final answer?
Is this me?
Am I on the air?
Now that's what I like to hear!
Are you AFRAID?
Now that's better...
who are AFRAID...
just to say GOOD MORNING!
I said ""Good morning!
I feel bad for his family.
I could lose my job.
You're talking about an act of God.
that's it?
Give it back!
Not until like...
I think that you did it.
That's not what I heard.
Now they think I did it.
You should already know that.
I have something to show you.
It is the name of my father...
and his father before me.
I am so sorry.
You have to do something for me first.
I want to show you something.
Where did you come from?
You'll know soon enough.
I can do anything I want...
and so can you...
How can you do that?
What'd you do!
A hundred and one I think.
Every day she does the same thing.
Is this about the book?
Time is running out.
We have to talk to her.
I just keep thinking that something awful has happened.
Yeah they told me to get out of the house.
I have to talk to you.
Will you please talk to me?
So the idea is that...
So we call them...
I know she's here.
She wrote it.
Will you come see her with me?
I've been seeing stuff...
We're moving through time.
I always wanted it to be at a time when...
I've never...
That's alright...
That's not good enough.
with whatever you wanted.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
for all they know...
maybe someone is like...
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
And you'd never been there before?
how I got there.
I mean will you GO with me?
That's like...
what they call it here.
Will you go with me?
We never would have had this conversation.
Why is that?
And there it is again...
Wonder where we'll be then.
What makes you think I'm not?
I got held back in school again.
You know change things.
have those too.
What kind of problems does your dad have?
you just moved here?
There are other things that need to be taken into account here.
That's too simple.
If I'm lucky.
She has the car...
I can tell her anything.
are you still with us?
it would be nice to look at you some time...
and see my son.
Get out of my room.
I wish I knew where you went at night.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I know I'm not the best...
But whatever happens in your life...
you just say...
and do whatever is in your heart.
You be honest...
even if they look at you funny...
and they will.
They'll tell you that you're wrong.
I know Dad.
You're my only son...
A lot of people.
It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.
Over the years...
We almost hit her with the car the other day.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Where it came from?
Do they know yet?
It was great.
So how was school today?
I think I already have.
It is up to the children to save themselves these days.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
You're a good teacher.
That's a good question...
it's Friday.
It has no history books...
Why should we care?
They want to change things.
You must let me help you.
there would be no law...
and no one else.
He's right there...
He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this.
I can see him right now!
Time is almost up.
When will this happen?
Then I will go back in time...
I have the power to build a time machine.
I think now that he might...
and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
I think I only have a few days left...
You've done it again?
That I did it again.
How did you feel...
What did you want for Christmas that year?
I was playing with fire.
So your parents...
she's like waiting for this big...
moment or something.
I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
every week I come in here and I tell you stuff...
and you know what?
What did you find?
The way that they looked...
They were like workers...
and I found something...
I'd like to believe that I'm not...
It's like I could spend my whole life thinking about it...
She died when I was eight.
How does that make you feel?
Who is they?
Can anyone else see him?
That's sick!
What else do you think about during school?
I think about...
fucking a lot during school.
I asked you about school.
I think about girls a lot.
Do you think a lot about girls?
What is her name?
I met a girl.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Into the future.
Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Follow him where?
He said to follow him.
to get out of bed...
just before this happened.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
So I met a new friend.
All of this...
I've been taking it.
Okay but it has to be a small one.
We should throw a party.
We could totally get away with it.
I got in.
That's a nice name.
well that's not the way the world works.
I was just being honest.
What's her name?
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice.
Well Jim I think you're full of shit!
What's your name son?
How much are they paying you to be here?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Well you know about his past.
Thank you for seeing us...
He died remember?
You remember him from high school?
So let me get this straight.
And I left money on the kitchen table.
It is a big deal.
How did you know --
I took a year off to be with you.
Of course I care.
That's enough.
How did this happen?
This is so last-minute...
as you can see...
Yes I saw the news.
but what is the real issue here?
And how do they do this?
The bottom line...
not only am I a TEACHER...
if you could wait...
What is this shit?
His parents are both at work.
Everybody goes home.
It's all the stuff I get to do.
It's from State!
You're lucky as hell so you might as well enjoy it.
You stop right there.
You are a good person.
Good things happen to good people.
She wanted you to have this.
I'm so dead...
So what do I say?
Oh God I'm dead...
You're what?!

That's-a pretty good.
Not a bad idea.
Well we'll let that one go.
Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Now - let's talk this thing over.
Yes but I'm not working for you any more.
I'm on the other side.
Late again eh?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
That's not bad for any day.

You know how to make love?
Send in the next girl.
You told it to me.
Where did you hear that story?
What did you say to her?
How about him?
That's a-no good.
Look --  I come from one country.
You come from another country.
Sure that's easy.
Do you know how to start a war?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
What do I get?
You know I'd be lost without a telephone.
Now - where were we?
Oh yes - I just made you Secretary of War.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
That's no good.
I like to work on the outside.
I must have something easy.
What other job you got?
I should've been here a long time ago.
No not yet...
That was for you again.
He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
Oh no -- nothing doing.
How much does the job pay?
I'm sorry I'm not in.
I wanted to have a long talk with you...
That was for you.
What do you call your dog when you want him?
Half watch dog?
Well - what is he now?
What kind of a dog is he?
It must be done right away.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Where's my secretary?
I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Why - er - Mrs.
My course is clear...
this means war...
That's it...
it was a seven letter word.
Oh -- you mean...
What I called you...
Why what did I call you?
You ask me to forget...
THEN IT'S WAR!
Then it's war?
Give me that again!
This has gone far enough!
but we can have a little family of our own.
When you get through with her feet you can start on mine.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you Mrs.
Why -- why -- of course.
and the bigger the better.
Come come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.
Maybe you can suggest something.
Where is son?
It is easy to see you have an open mind.
You're not so bad yourself Mrs.
I'd like to be with you to the very end.
I was with him to the very end.
Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Now who were the six?
Now what were you saying?
What'll I do with this card?
For you I would do anything...
Oh would you...?
This is terrible!
I want you!
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Then there his somebody else?
But you see - well - I --
What is money?
Perhaps he will listen to you...
I thought everything was working out fine.
It is every woman's problem.
War is not a woman's problem.
That's where you come in.
From what I've heard Mrs.
If only I could find her.
If only she could see me now here with such lovely kind friends.
Then maybe she would love me as I am.
I've tried to hard to be good.
She was so kind...
so kind to me.
I've always thought that myself.
You have so many nice things and so much room.
One or two?
Yes please two.
Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
But why did I do it?
What was this all for?
That I am very little different from him.
You've been like this all evening.
You stay with me.
And here are my mother and father.
Well these things take time.
what is in his mind?
I mean I've always thought he was.
I think he must be.
Is he simple?
But I thought you said that he was rather...
Yes very well I think.
Are the girls in bed?
Did it go well darling?
I'll get my bag.
Our man is sick.
Come right away.
Did you see it?
I found it.
I'll show you!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
I want him back!
So I gave him to you.
And now I want him back.
That's how they live.
We made a deal!
Do you understand me?
He's still very sick.
I'll explain the situation.
Never mind that I want my man!
Just a moment how did you get in here?
I want my man back.
Everything will be seen to.
I like doing business with you.
You and I understand each other completely.
Head's too heavy.
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest.
He was fine when he left here and now look at him.
What did you do to him?
He's been like this all night!
I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
They're reasonable men.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
No not that way.
And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr.
Yes I think I can.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Not me sir.
How did you know the rest?
I'm sorry too.
And what was that John?
but I do feel that Mr.
Thank you very much Sir.
Shall we say in a few days then?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
A few words?
He's doing very well.
In fact that's why I came to see you.
I think that if I were to present Mr.
Ah, no sir.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.
Would you like to meet him sir?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Is that it.
Good morning, sir.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Yes, of course...
everyone has been very kind.
How long did you and Mr.
everyone has been very kind to me.
Everyone has been very kind.
I feel much better.
Thank you for asking.
You must have quite a find there.
At the meeting of the society.
What have you got in there?
I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
How long has this man been here?
What say you fair one?
No but I certainly shall.
Have you read it?
I have something else for you...
Tell me about it please!
Well you must go.
It is one of the most beautiful places on earth.
You've never been?
Well even to work there would be wonderful.
Is it beautiful?
I just work there.
Do you live there?
She's very pretty your mother.
I would never think it!
It's so beautiful.
You are so...
I knew you'd understand.
I've brought you some things.
I hope you'll like Mr.
Well it's all quite...
I've never heard...
It's quite...
no there's absolutely nothing I can do.
How awful for John.
And I'm sure Mr.
Good day Mr.
You know I saw you once there in London.
Say hello to London for me.
I miss her.
Oh no my friend...
You want out?
Want to come out?
well good day Mr.
I'll have to find some more.
No one wants it.
Where did you get this box?
But it's so good I mean...
it's so very good.
Oh of course.
You too my friend.
No John not one that I can see.
It was wonderful!
Well I suppose I'll be on my way now.
Yes very soon.
It's for you John.
It's all for you.
Stand up John.
Let them see you.
Thank you my...
Is it the one you wanted?
There is one more thing John.
You did this for me?
Something just for yourself.
There is nothing!
I have everything you have given me everything I could possibly want.
I am happy every hour of the day.
I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Is there anything else John anything at all that I could get for you?
I thought as much.
John there's someone here who would like to meet you.
Would that be alright?
Good morning John.
would you like to see my mother?
Ah yes friends!
Oh they're gone for the day...
Where are your children
Who are they of?
Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Not at all John.
How is your tea John?
Well it's a lovely bedroom.
From a beautiful woman.
what's the matter?
or that man.
How long will I stay here?
What did you think?
is my new home?
I have something for you John.
Oh no do not say that.
You have been so kind to me.
I was afraid to say too much.
You wanted me to speak but I was afraid.
I never thought to ask.
You did not ask me.
It is much better than what I am used to.
I am very pleased to meet you!
Very good very good.
If you have any trouble with any of the words I'll help you.
I'm sure you'll be just fine.
Now let's go through the whole thing again shall we?
"" And you will say...
Why my dear Mrs.
my name is...
Well that's alright.
I understand you.
Now say the whole thing again Hello...
I want you to say them back to me.
That's much better.
I could understand that ""yes"".
All your friends are here.
John wants it.
But you saw them sir.
I'd like to have a word with you.
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm sure that if Mr.
I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself.
That was very good John very good.
That's all for today.
We shall do some more tomorrow.
Good Lord Mr.
Perhaps you've got the time for that Mr.
Good day sir.
Not quite yet Mrs.
Yes let's go in.
Shall we go in?
I've heard.
Now then Mrs.
YOU'RE FINISHED!
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME!
I just take the money.
WHERE is HE?
HE'S GONE!
I know all about it.
You were SEEN.
Where did you take him?
WHERE IS MR.
Here is my card.
He'll be there.
Who sent you?
I'd like to see it.
And who might you be sir?
Well my dear I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in....
But Father it IS!
It's all right!
She did I tell you!
It's all in your own mind Father...
It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
There's nobody here Father.
Look for yourself.
There IS no one.
I know you're in there!
It's my father!
I came to find someone...
Then I shall come too.
You've done what you came to do!
Then let go!
Yes -- I believe you do.
Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Do you believe I love you?
I MUST look!
It only seems to work on my father!
We brought him here.
We must stop him.
I'll bring it back.
Just give me a hand.
And the week before that?
You're as bad as my father.
Five this week; how many the week before?
That's just what I was trying to tell you.
And I thought you said it was something special...
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Why do you go on about that?
What does it matter?
We never went to bed together.
What was she like?
It was different...
What does that matter?
But you've...
FELT like this before...
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
No I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart...
you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
No of course not silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
you mean ""got into bed with"" them?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
But surely you know...?
Put them down!
PLEASE make them put them down.
What are THESE?
Those things in your hands.
What are what?
What are those?
Well of course.
WHAT did you say?
How do we know this is the way?
How is it you can see me?
You can all see me?
Where did YOU come from?
Is there nothing men can do?
Of course not...
when I was a child...
But have you ever seen it?
I see the world.
But it IS!
of course not...
Is there something the matter with it?
You've got to let me go!
I'll tell you what...
We come from a world where there IS no music.
It was very...
You're just saying that.
We'd love to hear it.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Oh no no no!
for a start...
I just did!
Why should you care?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
What a stupid idea.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Tell me your name?
should YOU care?
you looked so...
Oh that's all right then...
it's the thought...
Well you started it.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
you DO like me at all?
Oh get it over with.
Of course I like women...
I LOVE 'em.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
That's terrible!
What's wrong with making friends?
Come on move it!
He was lucky...
That's my boy!
She got me thinking...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I met this girl...
Who have you been talking to?
Make your mind up.
Well you ARE!
He can have my place.
You'll see!
You there and you there.
What are YOU doing here?
Why should WE care?
You must help us.
I've got you!
I feel a little...
Well come on!
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
You'd better sit there.
Even you sit there.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Now stop it!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
You mean we'd be dead?
for the last time...
I think we should go...
What's the matter with them?
There is another way.
How about making friends?
Well what else do we do?
But how could he know...
I have to go...
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I AM one Dad!
Well what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Yes it does!
I was sitting there.
Hey you two!
We'd be the first!
Are you afraid to try?
That's why they call me...
You will wait?
Well where is he then?
How did he do that?
What do we have to do?
You know my son our lord said...
No it is NOT.
We're HOME!
Is it sort of...
the whole time...
For the others...
If you go...
I go too...
What have you got there?
It's not my business any more!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
You've lost your mind.
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
YOU do it!
Together we stand!
Yes it is good.
But I told him ten.
Ooh that's a good one!
There is nothing we can do...
GIVE US A CHANCE Dad!
Well go on!
I'm just building up to it Dad.
Well of course he is!
HOLD it in!
But it's a responsibility...
So did my father and his father before him.
So did your father...
Tell him I'm coming!
he's not...
I'm game.
Well I'M certainly not either.
He died of old age!
I never do...
Who was the girl you walked off with?
I told you that later.
Yeah you told me that later.
You said things were fine.
I remember you turned around.
I'm so...
I should just go to her house.
No it was lovely.
I mean what kind of people do well at this stuff?
The last time I saw you.
How are you today?
He'll be right with you.
May I help you?
Nothing is wrong with you.
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Oh and I wanted to give you this.
It's a little...
It'll be great!
I'll get my shit.
We'll go next weekend and --
Nothing makes any sense.
I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
In the room?
I really want to but tonight's important.
Come over after I'm done here?
I was not.
You were not.
I think I know.
I think we can help.
Everything you can think of.
Everything about him.
Everything about you.
And we'll take it from there.
Do I end it?
Should I give it more time?
I'm not happy but what do I expect?
at some point...
But then I think he is a good guy and...
Do you mind if I turn this on?
I just wanted to say that.
Come by my house.
Is that somewhere we --
I sort of do.
Well sounds like me.
Listen did you want to make love?
I think I should go back.
Just to test out the phone lines.
So you'll call me right?
I walked out the door.
What if you stay this time?
I thought you knew that about me.
No it's our house!
Which one do you want to be?
I think we should go.
The water's fine.
Nobody's coming here tonight believe me.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I wish we did.
I think before.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think she's great.
I love her.
I'll give you a couple.
See what you think.
I know what you mean.
That's why I stopped.
No I stopped.
Say good-bye.
Yeah like that.
You mean like...
That sort of thing?
You know what I did.
I saw you sitting over here.
Try your best.
Maybe we can.
It would be different if we could just give it another go around.
Even after that.
I want you to just keep that in your head.
If you want to be with me you're with me.
I'd like to...
take you out or something.
But I needed to see you.
You did run away after all.
I did it.
Is that what you want?
I told her today I need to end it.
Exactly my point.
It's very late.
Come up and see me...
I could tell.
I'm sure I said.
I said: Are you sure?
I'll buy that.
Black's always good.
Something black though.
God I should know.
Your hair was red.
Do you remember what we talked about?
This is our first ""date"" date.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
What are we doing?
They found us before.
You must remember to tell me this in the morning.
There's this guy.
There's this guy!
Whatever shall we do?
You remember what happened next?
You know we're okay.
You'll remember me in the morning.
And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
I'm right here.
Such a beautiful view.
He says ""It takes a long time.
I want to know you.
I'm an open book.
I tell you everything.
It's you!
You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!
Oh thank God.
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children!
You're not ready.
I want to have a baby.
I have to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
I remember this.
Want to go?
Look at it out here.
And I'm happy.
Let me drive you home.
You're like some old lady or something.
It's three.
How could she have done this to me?
How could anyone do this to anyone?
Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You'll call me right?
I would like you to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like that.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so...
You should stay.
But right now I should go.
he says so many great things.
Well for the last week anyway!
I used to.
But I'm through with that.
So I've been seeing this guy...
You're very nice.
God I have to stop saying that.
Like I wanted to talk to you.
It's hard to --
Do you know what I mean?
You love someone -- that's it.
And anyway you sell yourself short.
But I get it.
And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
You're really nice.
I think about that.
I go to work.
I go home.
But I think I am.
I like to think I am.
It's hard to know.
That's what you're saying right?
You forget about those times.
She should know.
Do you believe in that stuff?
Drink up young man.
Just for a little while.
Just pick something good.
You just say.
I'm not really --
You pick it.
What do you want to hear?
No I'm okay for now.
Ready for another?
Take yours off.
I'd like to be from then.
It's pretty.
someone gave that to me just like recently.
I like it too.
You like that?
Sorry that was stupid.
Hey do you want to have a drink?
And I could --
I already told you that.
Thanks very much.
That was very nice of you.
I'm so stupid.
I like to read.
I'm not really.
Near the high school.
Where do you live?
It's cold.
No that's okay.
Well sure I'll just...
Take care then.
Anyway I have some stuff I need to --
Right now anyway.
That was nice of you.
I'm sorry I...
Whatever I'm a little out of sorts today.
I know it's here.
Now I'm nice?
I was just...
You seemed nice so --
It's a pretty name though.
Yeah I got it.
I was just trying to be nice.
More than once.
I'm getting too old for this.
I'm sure you would.
Someone's got that job.
I came up with that one.
You think that could possibly be a full time job?
That'd be a job coming up with those names.
How do you get a job like that?
That's what I'll do.
Ah the hair.
Like my daddy before me.
Well I'm there.
I'll call in dead.
Jesus is it five years?
That's why I was looking at you.
On the train I mean of course.
It's okay really.
I mean it's okay if you want to sit down here.
Why are you sorry?
We've made love.
Like a million times.
Look I have to go.
I have to think.
That's what you have to say?
How could it be true?
Maybe it's true then.
Who would even know to do this?
I probably got the same thing as you.
Did you send this?
You said I do.
Do you miss me?
I just walked in.
What took you so long?
Long day thinking.
I just got in.
Yeah I tried you at home.
I had to take the day to think.
I called you at work today.
They said you were home sick.
You called from upstairs.
I really should go.
But I went back to my food.
Your back to me.
The night we met.
My God it's over.
I wish you could come.
then I thought maybe not maybe not.
But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
I have to go home.
I'll do it later.
Is that like us?
And what are you like?
She called me an old lady here too!
And I remember I said...
Not after the way she was.
I love her so much.
How could she do this to me?
How could she not care about what we meant to each other.
That's your look for me.
I love you and if you knew that...
if I told you what happened...
I'll explain everything what we meant to each other.
I'll tell you everything about our time together.
You'll know everything again and...
I should just maybe talk to her.
I should maybe talk to you.
It's them.
It had some letters and numbers on it.
What were they?
There was a number on it.
I have to follow through with this.
Maybe I just need to learn to live with this.
First of all I'll get over it.
She did it to me.
I have to rid myself of this.
There are two of them.
I'm in your head too.
Stop it now!
You have to stop this!
We can help you through this.
You never should have.
Nothing you'll miss.
We'll speak soon.
I had a good time last night.
I really did.
I suppose you're right.
A good guy.
He's a good guy.
Miss you too.
I have been seeing someone for a little while.
It really does cut both ways.
I hope you get your work done.
In a minute.
Come to bed.
I'm cold.
It's not somebody else.
I just need some space maybe.
You met someone.
You take it.
So many beautiful important things.
They have a right to know.
Do you understand that?
Then why did you ask me?
I know what it is.
I brought some --
You were in red.
I'd never seen him look like that before.
You looked beautiful.
You looked in love.
Do you remember anything else?
Was I standing close to him?
Tell me everything.
I never saw you together like that again.
And after that?
How did I look?
It was here.
At his car.
You better go.
He's coming?
I just said that!
Well what should we do?
It's stopped.
I can help.
It's a good one all right.
It seems really appropriate.
That's a good one.
Have anything to drink?
You found us okay?
You thought it best.
But look I take full responsibility.
How could you --
Did you love me?
It's like listening to someone else's story.
I want to do the right thing here.
do we talk about this...
have a history.
You wanted it done...
to get past.
I have to finish in there.
It's almost morning.
We'll talk later.
I wish I was your wife.
I wish I had your kids.
an awful lot.
Is that terrible?
I thought it was appropriate maybe.
That's lovely.
It's no big deal.
There's another one I like I read.
Well I'd love to hear some.
How do you mean?
Okay we're back in.
You can bring her in.
He went home sick.
The guy we're doing?
Yeah probably a good idea.
I'll take it from here.
I tried that already.
I met someone tonight.
And only I know it.
Would you just try him?
As long as I'm here.
I think he's in a conference.
Let me ask my friend.
She was beautiful.
This one's history.
You can if you want.
Just wanted to let you know.
Yeah that looks better.
Does that help?
That's your problem.
Easy come easy go.
But that's an old story now......
You mean she's dead?
here's a picture!
Yes everything is getting worse.
But everything is also getting better.
Is everything getting worse?
What do you believe in then?
I came up here to get out of the way.
If you could help...
I know who you are.
Where are the others?
I just keep moving.
But that's your problem.
So be it.
It looks serious this time though.
That's hard to say.
You're political then?
Er you seem to know who I am and maybe even what I am.
By God it's great to have you here.
I suppose it was mine.
How does she like what in bed?
What about in bed?
How does she like it in bed?
then she left town.
How does she feel about you?
She's turned my head.
I'm not talking about her hands.
She's obviously that.
Why do you have to go?
We can go to dinner.
really make love.
You're the best?
I'm the best.
Are you in show business?
How much do you know about it?
Good good good...
you'll enjoy it you'll see.
I'll try it.
Just for you.
But what have you got to lose?
Now there's no reason why you must lose yours.
I believe you might enjoy one another.
So get this.
Are you starting to get it?
We're back at the beginning.
A job for me?
And what a job...
A tax write-off actually.
Like a little sister.
But first tell me about yourself.
I think I found something...
Do not do that!
I can see why they sent you along.
I heard it.
I am your best friend.
Will it work?
We have a man down...
I'll be all over it.
Stay on station.
If anything happens...
After seven years?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP!
Let the man speak.
Okay listen up.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can.
You been out there a long time.
Trying to break my record?
I'm telling you I saw it...
Saw what Mr.
It was like...
nothing was there...
I'd rather be dead.
Can you shut it down?
There must be a way!
You're okay now it's over...
It is not.
how do I...
What it's seen...
And what it's brought back with it.
Do you hear it?
And then he was gone.
I never told anyone until now.
It knows what we're afraid of.
Just one of those things.
I came close today.
We'll make it.
He'll live...
if we ever make it back.
I saw a man he was on fire.
You must have heard it!
What's happening...?
You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
I have to go with them.
She's come back.
this this happened?
I want our best people on this.
It's been two years since she died.
He's over it.
He's too close to it.
And then there's his wife.
It's not that simple.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
From the Other Place...
We still have pressure.
I built it.
How do you know all this?
We do it the hard way.
I believe you're up for a walk Mr.
They're been gone seven years.
This is not about me at all!
That would be like...
Before it happens to us.
I'm -- I'm okay.
Can anybody hear me...
how's the client?
I found one.
Everything's been shut down.
So where are they?
Clear and open on my mark.
We've got pressure.
I am sorry.
But now we have to go to work.
No no its alright.
Good for four months.
What's the hold up?
Go to hell.
I'm not asking you to believe me.
You'll see for yourself...
You're all coming with me.
There is no God.
There is only...
Better if I just show you.
Then what what are you?
What makes you think I'll miss?
It is NOTHING.
I told you...
Maybe you're right.
And I think there is.
The ""Other Place what is that...?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
Where did you send it?
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place.
Let's not make it worse.
No one goes near that thing.
If it worked yes.
If it worked.
How much time do you need?
We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes.
One of my men is down.
I want to know what happened to him.
I can see that what're they for?
This is where I need you.
Help us to do our job.
What does it say?
That's what we're here to find out.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Until then do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Where is it where is it...
Get out of there now!
No no we just got her back together...
I'll find her.
She was right behind me I turn around she's gone.
She could be anywhere.
Get outside go back to work.
In twenty hours we run out of air.
We are fucking dead.
We have a situation here...
It is now.
We've got some weather.
Something like that yeah.
What are you trying to say?
That's not it.
That's just wrong it goes against everything we know...
We're a long way out...
He's dead...
I'll do it --
We stay put...
We've got to shut it down we've got to...
We've got enough to worry about.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I thought you wanted an answer.
And that's the only one I have.
You've got to listen...
you saw what you saw.
It was someone else.
I'll just get the same thing...
After that we'd better be on our way home.
How much oh-two do we have?
Let's find out how much time we just bought.
Keep your eyes open.
Come around to three-three-four...
Then what are you doing here?
Come on people let's go!
About an hour ago.
I saw my son.
I saw nothing.
There's no one here.
Can you see a body?
Here's another one.
They're all over the place.
He's hard but he's fair.
You got any coffee?
We have to do something oh God...
Almost got it.
Do you know what it was?
Keep him talking.
What if the air has gone bad?
Get them back --
What happened to his eyes?
There's nothing out there.
If something happens, we'll be on our own.
It means nothing.
"" What did he mean?
It wants me.
It's as if time just...
stopped for seven years.
Two years now.
It must be hard being so far away from her.
Do they have pressure?
A straight line.
Those yours too?
I'm a little...
How'd you know it was me?
You went your own way then.
So why start now...?
It's not him.
Oh he did.
You should try it --
Who the hell came up with them?
So when do we leave?
And you can?
Power it up?
And we know how that turned out.
To help you.
I've run every test known to man.
Where do you think?
Let me buy you something to eat.
Looks like you could use the company.
I already got it.
Everything I want.
It's still me.
What did you...
You home baby?
You bring him back in one piece or you can forget being Best Man.
I'll be watching over you.
I'm good as is.
We're working as hard as we can --
Oh you remember my name do you?
We need to be careful until we're normal again.
That she thought might be better coming from me...
Yeah nine years straight.
Am I okay?!
Well maybe you should date him.
How long was I out?
This is serious.
You should be the one up there.
He's made a few changes.
This makes five.
I had it at four.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
We got what we wanted.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once.
What if he made the call to shut us down --
What about his first born?
This is business.
You'd never know it.
He's just a little...
Hey I'm Mr.
Never saw that one coming.
You had the best --
They're fine.
Back on Earth.
where am I?
Maybe she's not over it either.
Yeah well his eyes say different.
That's terrible news...
I wish I could tell you.
No: You're ON FIRE!
Not this again --
You're on fire!
I though we went over this.
Left is trouble.
I've never felt better in my life.
When do you get off work?
So are you!
You're hot!
But all these people...
Here we go again.
What if we have some you know...
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Oh well that's easy: I'm hot.
Oh it is.
You've been working out.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Now what is up with that?
Let me take care of you for once.
What are you doing --
You think those people out there care about you?
She's not here.
So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Yeah for the last time I hope.
I'm moving back to the real world.
You two need a time-out.
You gave us names?
That's my sister.
You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
What is that thing?
Top left like you asked.
Today Wall Street.
Tomorrow who knows...
That's why.
You could have any woman in the world but --
You know maybe you should get some rest --
And that's a good thing?
Everything else is conversation...
How's the other matter?
Then what is it?
It's not just the money.
They're ready for you sir.
And if he's not...?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
You need a doctor.
make it work.
I'm saying it now.
Waiting for you to come find me.
but I wanted you to be that man.
speak his mind.
I gave him twenty.
Of course I was.
Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Remember our first date here...?
And look up.
I'm not the only one in there.
Better than your life.
No way to know.
And you sure you can control this thing?
There was you.
But your head got in the way...
like it always does.
What in the world would give me that idea?
If it happened to him then it could...
We need to get past them.
look at your hands.
What do you mean you --
You always had a way with words.
I should be getting back.
It's been changed.
That's exactly what I meant.
I was talking about us.
It's time for action.
But I'm not done with the machine --
What I should have done a long time ago.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing...
How much do you know about what happened to you?
He's had some kind of...
And he's not the only one.
It's too late for him and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
But we came here to do a job.
So let's do it.
The number's seventy-five.
You remember in school we talked about working together.
That's what I was about to explain...
Oh I think you already have.
There's something we need to talk about.
Something I need to ask you...
I told you I'm fine.
Just find him.
Right of course the company...
I understand the business reasons.
It's just business.
I'm just saying I know what it's like to lose something you love.
But for you?
I can probably get you in there.
We're almost out of high school this is our last year.
Then if we get back together we'll know it's the right thing.
What's there to do at the Point?
How much did they cost?
First door on your left!
It's the first door on your left!
It's the first door on your left.
Just make it quick.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
What is that you've got on?
How hard is it to...
I'm sorry sir.
But if you wait a minute...
Give me my money back.
Well that's not the way it works really.
I want my money back right now.
Well I believe you have to fill out a form.
And Mark from school.
But your face did!
Maybe you just need to give her some time.
it's true.
Where did you hear that?
I've been doing some thinking.
It's my last school year.
Work is great.
Is everything okay at work?
I got problems of my own.
I'll explain everything later.
I'd say...
They're not home yet.
Now my little sister goes to the same high school.
The party's over.
So who do you have first period?
Dad says you have to get up!
Give me a break.
So you want me to pay for it?
There's only one thing we can do.
We've got to get rid of it.
All right I take it back.
Take that back.
I know it's yours.
How do you know it's mine?
We only did it once.
I think I came.
Let's continue.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
How about both of us at the same time?
He's my friend too.
It's getting pretty late...
I know what I look like.
Mark is a really nice boy...
You like him?
What a guy.
I walk every day.
What's the last book you read?
Well for one I read.
I'm trying to feel things more.
Those girls love me.
I always stick up for you.
I've been looking for that thing!
It's great!
you know what Mark?
You want it back?
You come here?
I'm really pretty busy...
The food is coming and everything.
Did you go home and get it?
It's happening right now.
What happened to your date?
It's Mark.
One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
I think I've got it.
how do I get started?
What's the Five Point Plan?
I will give it to you for free.
I need real help.
I'll tell you these kids today...
Of course something happens.
Let her know.
Use your face.
Use your body.
This is what I do.
Here's what you do.
I can see it all now.
Well what do you want me to do?
It's never too soon!
Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
It's too soon.
Did you get her name?
Did you get her number?
where did you see her?
It's her.
You should work for yourself.
They're beautiful.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Peter you want to run with it?
Do you want to set it up for us?
How often do you go?
School is no problem.
And if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time.
your eyes look a little red.
Nice to be here.
I feel great.
That's him!
He did it!
Make up your mind.
My brother's car!
I thought he was out of town.
This is my brother's car.
Yeah like maybe never.
He's not coming.
There's lots of men around here.
I'd rather just forget about it.
I paid for it and everything.
I really thought he would show up.
It's the guy's responsibility too.
It could be.
I'll find out Monday.
What do you think it is?
Everything is just so...
Better look in the house.
He'll be out here.
You'll meet him.
Thirty to forty minutes.
Listen to this...
But it's a nice idea.
Does that ever happen?
It's like school.
What is he?
How many times do I have to tell you?
nobody will ever take me out.
You want to have kids with him?
Even if I am fifteen?
You've got to get used to working Christmas.
There's his car.
I know he's at work tonight.
My mother told him I was still at high school after I told him I was nineteen.
That's my line!
It was nice.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was okay.
Was it great?
That's where that group got its name from.
There's nothing to it.
Well I never did it.
What's the big deal?
You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Hand this morning.
You're fifteen.
I did it when I was thirteen.
I called them.
So what did you do?
Do you think he'll call this week?
He gave me his card.
What should I do?
You can take it.
Well you'll find out next year.
Do you have a guy like me every year?
A guy to...
Hand can I ask you a question?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
You sit right here on your bed.
I'll use the chair here.
Did I do something wrong Mr.
Mind if I come in?
And you my friend.
I've been thinking about this Mr.
If I'm here...
and you're here...
Having some food.
Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
There's no birthday party for me here!
That's the name they gave me.
Is this your first time?
I mean back to your home.
I think I better take you home.
I am really nineteen.
Are you really nineteen?
I wonder how long it will last?
All right the point it is.
The point sounds fine.
How about the point?
So do you.
'  You look nice tonight.
How about your phone number?
What can I get for you tonight.
I know everyone says that.
You look like you could still be in high school.
And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I know everybody says it but I really mean it.
He died a couple years ago.
It's like his own holiday.
it's getting kind of late.
Do you really have to go?
I've got to go home.
I had Mr.
Did you have Mr.
How stupid right?
pretty nice house you've got here.
Want something to drink?
Where's your brother?
I'll come in.
No they're away for the weekend.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Do you know what you want?
I've heard that too.
She is pretty good.
Do you have Mrs.
It's my sister's.
This is a nice car.
Thanks for coming to get me.
My other question is...
What's your other question?
We keep them in case the people come back.
You keep them.
We keep them.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Anything to drink?
And I will have...
Are you ready to order here?
And now I have to get back to the news.
yes yes I see what you mean...
This terrible war.
When will it end?
There's a war on man!
Well thank you.
Just enjoy your stay.
Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Let's have lunch!
But he will be available?
Perhaps later this morning?
the manager Mr.
put them on a personal basis...
It makes sense.
Does that make sense?
And sure as hell not in the South.
You'd never believe it.
it's out of control.
What do you mean by that?
Hell I really hate to hear this.
That's how he got so big.
Not a major.
And nobody did anything?
Jesus Christ man.
What did they do to her?
Not down in my parts.
Just another good American like yourself.
Oh my God!...
You're the type.
Let's get right to the heart of this thing.
You want one?
You never saw me before.
You were supposed to turn back there!
See what she comes up with.
So do we lady.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!
That's a good idea.
Some of what?
We should get some of that.
Where'd you get this?
It's gone too far.
I'll call her.
She's my problem.
No she's looking for you.
It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.
Not with the press around.
Hell somebody has to do it.
What could they do?
The guy that took the head was about six-seven and maybe three-hundred pounds.
with a lot of people watching too!
They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Not like this.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
She's got to go.
I felt sorry for the girl I wanted to help her!
I figure she can do about four at a time.
Stop talking like that.
This girl is a god-send.
Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
It's terrible.
It'll probably work out.
Jesus she's never even had a drink.
All that shit in the car is yours!
You understand that?
You'll like it.
Are you ready?
I want to get HIGHER!
Back the tape up.
I need it again!
I want that fucking radio!
Whatever's right.
How about a check?
Can you give me two hours?
Put it on.
Turn it up.
Put that tape on.
I have to put the car in the lot.
Have you made a deal with him?
Did you put him on to her?
Room service sent it up.
He's got hold of my woman!
I thought we might need it...
I think there's something wrong with me.
That's just what they want us to do...
Let's get out of here!
When does this thing stop?
Can we make it?
Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
You'll be straight in a few hours.
Leave the country.
This is my last drink.
Look over there.
I hate to say this but this place is getting to me.
This is the place.
What do you expect?
I want it now.
They almost had us there!
That was quick thinking.
To do the job of course.
Look what are we doing here?
I could see it in his eyes.
That's good...
They'll never let us back in that place.
That's the press table.
Shit, let's get it over with.
But what about our room?
I told him I knew what he was up to...
He knows we're onto him!
Maybe thirty more minutes.
Are you ready for that?
How long do I have?
You better be careful.
You did it!
Did you see what god just did to us?
And eat them!
Somebody call the police!
We need help!
Watch your language!
Turn up the fucking music!
What's wrong with us?
Yes, it's right here.
But do you?!
Hang onto it.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
We must do it.
What kind of story is this?
I tell you, my man.
If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
This one sounds like real trouble!
Or just think it?
Was I talking?
Did they hear me?
We're your friends.
We're not like the others.
You'd pay me for that?
Maybe she's not part of it.
Why do you think we're here?
What made you do it?
Who paid you off?
I've heard a lot about it.
Can you make it that far?
Here's how it is.
Do I make myself clear?
Could I have that please?
Of course officer.
You and a lot of other people.
I'd do just about anything for that!
One phone call every day.
Just tell us what you've seen.
I'll help you all you need!
In that case maybe she can help.
Part of what?
You're just as much a part of it as they are!
You were after the evidence.
Who put you up to this -- the manager?
They'll get in!
You said it yourself they'll get in!
Did you find your girl?
Where is everyone?
We'll meet in three hours?
You know where it is?
Oh come on!
Are you two all right?
Did you see that!?
We made it!
I think we made it!
He's right let's move.
We should go!
We should go right now!
With what just happened upstairs --
I got my.
IS IT CLEAR?!
Who the hell would you call?
Well your last words can be ""I told you so.
You got something better?
OPEN THE DOOR!
"" WHAT IS ""OH?
"" What does ""oh"" mean?
Come on come on.
this is just another Tuesday.
You all sure about this?
This is it!
This is our only way out!
We go out the front we're dead.
We go out the back we're dead but if we go UNDER them...
we might just make it.
Now who else is in?
Seven can go.
What's it for?
They're right here.
No no no it was...
And the head?
And the rest of 'em?
Get in line!
Who's with me?
We're better off.
Did those things leave?
We lived near power lines.
Why do you take shit from him?
Just cover me.
It was built to move.
Yeah the lot's right there.
What's in the back?
we can get out of here.
I'm in.
How much you got to see the show?
How much I got what?
How much you got?
Why not then?
You should try a little.
I pick who goes!
What's it for!?
What do you mean what?
Go for it.
It's by the far wall.
Someone make sense.
I'll go with ya.
They'd be easy.
And what's that?
What's that!?
They were all over the place.
You all know where that is?
Get something on that.
WE NEED HELP.
I'M FINE!
I'm fine!
We'll be on the other side waiting for you.
Am I too heavy for you?
Let's see what happens.
Yeah I'll go.
Is there any other way out of this place?
anybody else have an idea?
Everyone take a role.
Let's wait it out.
YOU'LL HIT US!
She's not very nice is she?
Anything at all?
GO-GO-GO!!
Get to your cars!
Not without you!!!
There's cars back there right?
If there is only one way out for us there is only one way in for them.
Okay well that's something.
And the last one is the...
Did we make it?
I'd love to.
We should stick together out there.
I'll do anything to help.
I need to get to her.
We all have to be strong right?
I'm fine I really am.
You have no idea what is running through me right now.
I'm ready.
What was I thinking?
Never ever never let you go.
That's one piece of four problems.
I just hit it like you said.
She wants to talk to you help you out.
What're you doing?
Here take a few of these.
Okay let's go get 'em.
But we've been at it since six this morning.
Come on it's just what you need!
Let everyone see you.
Talk to them live it up!
I mean good.
That's not the point.
She wants out of her contract Mr.
I'd like nothing better.
No I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm concerned with everything Mr.
Never mind that.
I'm concerned about you.
That's a very good book.
Since we have you on a seven year contract I'm planning long-range.
I like your looks.
You see: We've got to change that name.
It's my job you know?
please please tell Mr.
What if they find out I'm a real person.
Not a real person!
Or my car.
and work clothes...
and that awful car --
Well I suppose I should just say it.
It's your clothes.
Okay but come here first.
My wife is in Europe but this is her house...
Give them that.
I tell you I want to give these things!
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I know but --
but wait a minute.
We're supposed to be different right?
And this play...
That's the deal.
Good Lord no it's just...
well we found it.
well you see that's the point.
The point is Mr.
Get your clothes on lady --
You have no right!
Get the hell out of here --
Get your clothes on.
""  There's a war on you know?
In my eyes officer.
Hey where's the fire sister?
You want his name?
There was another call too.
You learn your lines?
Just remember tomorrow remember what I told you.
I'll lose my job!
Just hold her.
Let's get her out of here tonight right now!
Let's take her with us!
If I'm not myself now just who do you think I am?
We'll talk more about this.
I know better.
I know you believe that.
It's just what I've needed to get away like this.
I'm ready to get on with it.
This is your chance!
But I'll never win that.
You know where you're taking me.
You know what she'll do.
But I gave her my word.
She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do.
It's such a simple thing.
whatever I decide will it be okay with you?
or just let it go.
But Dad I'm asking about me.
What do you think I should do?
but she could have been...
I know that Dad but --
I love you Dad.
And you think it's worth all this?
You really want to go?
What do I do Dad?
It's already started Dad...
it's possible.
That's the way of things but Mr.
He talked to me today.
well he does a lot of things.
Yeah I suppose...
See you next weekend Dad.
That sure is a thought.
See you next weekend?
They pay me back in other ways.
I have a right to talk to her.
I can thank you for that.
Be my good girl and go.
Nothing's off the record with me.
Just one minute...
Will you be getting back together?
What about your husband?
Not if I can help it.
Are you really serious?
well okay I'm still in school.
Boy I'd love to...
Only if you were in it.
You can always come see it in London.
Just a little way.
That would be okay.
Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
It was very good to see you again.
No we're not.
I'd ask you to take me home but...
I sold the house.
Yeah I heard about that.
I got a new car.
Only it's red.
you're looking well.
Sure I did that's why I'm here.
Fine thank you.
Did you watch the show?
How nice to see you.
And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you okay?
I'll find you.
time has a way of --
If you love me you can wait right?
A month six months whatever it takes.
You're the only person who ever...
Been a lot of years you know.
A long time waiting.
When I feel somebody near me now...
You need me.
This is our chance.
When you got a chance you better take it.
if you need me...
You give up on her?
She's my mother.
She's just...
There's just one more thing.
I'll act like I do until I do.
you're too important to me.
Look out for me.
What a man!
There's only one other thing wrong with you.
I'm not taking you there and that's that!
Not a war exactly.
It's more a...
I should've known...
Where are we mean man?
You've looked a whole lot better.
Oh my God I look awful.
Who said I was a lady?
And then one day you realize you are you're at the top...
and there's nothing there.
I just wanted to be part of something...
And I could say: I did that I made something good.
You're coming.
And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody really?
Well I would have you know?
Can you afford it?
Everyone else has.
What's this red stuff?
How the hell do you find me anyway?
I just hate it!
Two fucking lines!
' Just like that!
This is important.
He's watching.
You can do that you know?
I want to do something...
Makes 'em feel better.
If you give them what they want you can get anything.
If they say they love it they'll probably love it.
Well she's back to earth now.
and my mother!
You're telling me.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once?
Is that why you did it?
I meant the other way around.
I met someone.
What can I tell ya...
it's done.
Why'd they do it?
Yeah I read about that.
Look at you!
I want so many...
You can make good money at it.
So you think I should go.
I do want to go though...
to New York especially...
but I wanted to do it...
When you were up there you were really...
there know what I mean?
Everyone else looked stupid.
You looked okay.
How'd I look?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
What'd you think?
You think I'd miss it?
Did you see the play?
I'll give it a try Mr.
I suppose not.
Could look bad for your Daddy.
But I'm not.
take your word for it.
So who are you then?
But other people seem to.
I'm just sixteen you know?
You know I've never been able to figure that out.
Yeah I know what that's like...
And no people.
It's always beautiful at this time.
I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Sure it's true.
That's fine with me...
Did you expect him to look you up?
I never saw him.
Answer the question!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Is that not true?
Well look they took your stuff out.
I live here.
Who're you?
Yeah tonight I think I got it.
You think I got it?
I already have.
They'll all want you all the girls!
Take me home with you.
Then it's very simple.
It's in you.
Then show me!
But I want to.
I'm trying!
I know but I'm not seeing it.
You're not talking now.
Not after what you've done to me.
I'm still me...
I'm trying real hard all this time to be me...
Okay boys I'm ready.
But I'm not you mother and I never will be and thank god for it!
That goes for you too!
You're my mother!
I want you to rest...
for a while anyway.
Oh just leave those things for now.
You know what that's like?!
You want to throw it all away is that it?
You had everything little sister.
a wonderful husband.
I was never sick!
They had no business putting me in there!
My only responsibility is to myself now!
I told him to come up!
They want you back!
I've decided...
now it's over.
I want a different kind of life something...
And I love you.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
How long will you be?
Just a walk.
I think I need a little air.
I want you to.
It would make me so happy.
Well who have we here...?
Then why did you bring them?
And here's one from nice Mr.
He says that...
Tell them who I am!
You're taking me home!
I'll see you get the rest you need.
Yes but important people are concerned about this.
It's my life.
I'll pay your way to New York.
But they're using you!
No my dear.
Who do you think you are God?
But you have no authority!
You're nothing!
I'm ready to get out!
So you go back there...
you go back and you tell them to let me out!
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Oh for Christ's...
I never said...
She said something funny and I said...
You make so many friends.
It was very good to see her.
Is there something else?
I'll have someone show you to your room.
after we know each other a little better...
Did you really say that?
Will you please sit down now?
I'm not interested.
Please sit down...
Are you really?
We've only just met!
So it seems.
May we be serious for a moment?
They sure hate to use that word.
Show me one now.
Would you not?
He was father.
He from his God.
I from mine.
I am as he made me.
What is that to you?
I could see you were a friend to him.
I was watching.
You were with him at the end.
I am afraid.
I have been...
they will hate me...
and they are so very beautiful
Why do you not go to them?
Do they live around here?
People are afraid.
Better that way...
Or the fire?
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS!
SHE SAID MY NAME!
GET AWAY FROM HER!
SHE'S MINE!
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind.
She's not for you.
I'll be with you on yours.
I will not!
I draw the line.
She'll live again.
You'll make her.
I'll be waiting.
I want this over and done with.
That choice is yours.
There is something I want.
Who am I?
In these hands?
In this mind?
In this heart?
You're wrong.
Do you know I knew how to play this?
Do I have one?
Or was that a part you left out?
What were you thinking?
I'm not sure I believe.
I had no mother...
I see it before me.
as well as mine.
More to the point why am I here?
What did you want with me?
Then why am I here?
How did you find me?
Yes I speak.
and know the ways of Man.
I've been waiting for you.
Two months now.
We'll say it came today.
And not a word of them to Father.
I should leave today.
So have I
Something's wrong.
It's been months.
It's not like him.
And you look so lovely.
What would your dear mother say?
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Is he not back yet?
Open this door for no-one!
I have been waiting for this ever since.
I remember the first time I ever saw you.
So beautiful even then.
Now husband and wife.
Brother and sister no more.
Every moment we stay.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Is your answer yes?
Why the change?
What about your work?
A month at most that's all I ask.
You are life itself.
The moment I am done.
I want this family to live again.
It's not something I can explain now.
I'm all right.
Do you know this man?
Is there something between you?
They've done a fine job.
If what you say is true it is a matter for the police!
I've no choice
My more than sister.
I love you
If only I could.
But one of us must stay.
Father's not strong.
I wish to be your wife.
I wish to be your husband.
Brother and sister still?
All my life I've known.
To be the best there ever was.
I'll have to do better than that.
Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run.
Why should it be so?
Oh do give him here!
A baby boy.
God took her from us.
She was mother to me as well.
But ours is the job of the living.
It's up to us now to hold this family together.
We must think of Father and be strong for him.
What kind of God is He to will this?
It's not ours to decide.
It's God's will.
I've come too far to turn back now.
We'd be out of work.
I'm quite serious.
By my hand.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
I'll look after your father.
You look after her.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Quite a place.
What went on here?
It's his turn for that just now.
Just as well.
Listen to what I'm saying.
Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Thousand new cases a day now.
University's shut down.
I'm busy just now.
Few months perhaps.
I'm involved in something just now.
But it is time to move on.
This has got to stop.
Nobody's seen you in months.
There are sick people who need our help.
Here and now.
Not in some future time.
He had more important work.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Death is God's will!
They'll hang him all the same.
And here's to Him.
Somebody has to!
Only you would think of that!
Now you've got him started.
It's a letter to my father.
keep them to yourself.
Quite a few.
Can you think of a better reason?
Of course I am.
Are you having me on?
Very well then.
In my heart he was our child.
Answer the question.
Tell me Mr.
Oh now you have gone too far.
I tell you what we need my friends.
Nature can be wonderful and terrible.
What I do on my own time is my own business.
Fine do so.
You can even join me here if you like.
This is the sort of thing I'm talking about!
I've been watching you.
those live on.
Then explain it whatever it is.
I've spent years planning this.
Your men are right to be afraid.
You know of it?
How is it you come to be here?
Maybe we should wait for Mr.
We should go now.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
So young so pretty.
No no they're all dead...
It's just this place.
It will be all right.
I'll take care of you.
She's dead...
Please save me...
It's still early anyway.
Just in case.
Tomorrow is another day.
It's something about tomorrow.
What'd you see?
If you're still up we can talk okay?
It's been my whole life.
Stay a week.
Help get it ready.
Next Friday if you're not happy I'll put you on the bus myself.
Probably be best for everybody.
You want to leave?
Any particular reason?
I wish I could spend more time at it.
You draw very well.
That's got her.
Just run now?
What's the matter with it?
It's dead.
Try the pay phone.
They're off now.
I'll go take a look.
Not if they're where I think they are.
did he get in there?
You can only do what you can do.
What'll you do when you leave here?
It makes no sense.
And it's this place.
Maybe I can help?
It's long and personal.
It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.
The others show up?
I'll be along.
Somebody'll see.
You know what I said though.
I meant everything.
You said we were special.
Chance to get even?
Get behind him more.
A short somewhere.
I had to.
Take a second...
Give me a hand?
Where'd you get that stuff?
The phone was ""Mr.
That was the telephone.
Whatever you make yourself.
What's to eat?
It's even better.
Wait a minute woman.
Always have been.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
"" You just saw it.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
It's beautiful...
There you are dead wrong.
That's thirty percent.
I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Two and a quarter.
One night on the town.
Not in that stuff.
Anything else you want?
You said it was just you and your son.
Just my son and I.
How many with you?
Yeah follow us.
So do I just follow you?
That's like new.
You like the car?
I'm sorry to hear that.
And this girl's family's dead.
You said meet you in the morning.
Have you ever been there before?
Get to the door!
Thank you son.
I'm running the show.
"" I need your cover.
He's running the show.
Now you listen to me.
Son I have this situation under control.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
They never let anybody go.
What's this guy's problem?
Why do you want to stop?
We got about two more hours of day light left.
What's this stuff?
Okay I'll buy that.
In other words no.
I'm like you.
Now is your shit together?
To your family.
I asked a question.
Would you like me to ask it again?
Did they find you?
There's no way you could get across.
Yes you did.
What did you call me?
I never said do what I do I said do what I say.
That means you too.
I'm not there yet.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
That way everybody gets what they want.
Everybody's happy.
But you're right enough with the getting to know you shit.
Now there's two ways we can play this hand.
But we go down the second we'll both win.
Am I correct?
I was a minister.
I've seen one of these before.
Is this real?
Yes they do.
How'd it happen?
Yes she is.
She's dead?
Where is the little lady?
What are their names?
Go sit over there.
Sorry I need everybody.
If you're taking people take me.
Not a chance.
It's about money all right but not yours.
What's this about money?
How does that happen?
He's my son.
What's the story with you two?
Everybody goes home!
In effect I'm already dead.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
About two hours from now.
It has a bed.
That's all I care about.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
We've all done it.
That happens you'll get it back.
Look I know this is hard on you kids.
To answer your question yes I do believe in Jesus.
But do I love them?
He said when we come home if you still feel the same way --
I just bet you would.
You asked me if I would --
What you said to me in the room.
In the room.
Where are you taking us?
Watch my back!
Daddy's dead.
We have to go back for Daddy!
You hate us.
Ready for round two?
Get it and bring it up here will ya please?
Do you believe me?
You got three minutes.
Do you understand what I just said?
-- see this television!
Why just look at all this.
You got your kitchen --
We can only hope for the best.
We'll get 'em all right.
That's all that's been on the box all day.
Not even for lunch?
I never said help us!
If I told him no he'd know something was up.
I did what you said.
You get out!
This is a private club.
Would you care to join us?
My shit is together.
We're here -- getting ready to go in there.
So get your shit together brother.
Where are you right now?
You know what you look like?
That's what you look like.
That's what you think?
It's not a big deal unless you make it a big deal.
Sure you're okay?
Yeah we were just standing there.
Yeah I think so.
You meant that but you meant the other too.
Now shut up.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
Just say yes!
Nothing else just say yes.
This is not me!
You try to stop me god help you.
Do you think this is what I am?
Is it me?
Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!
There's nothing wrong with me brother.
Yeah explain it to me.
She's in the other room.
What'd ya mean what?
Where's the woman?
I heard it on the radio.
What'd ya see?
-- This conversation is over.
All I'm saying --
So it is written so shall it be done.
How's that feel?
How's it feel?
What did I tell you?
Shut up and start the car.
Start the car.
We all saw it.
I've got no one left to lose but you.
He needs our help!
Daddy's dead!
He was too far away.
The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
You could take their head off.
Go out and bring it in.
Yeah it's mine.
I take it that's yours.
Okay I'll have one.
""  See what you can find.
But are there...
I mean how many...
Just a friend.
We have friends too you know.
The woman I saw you with...
Just some of the women.
Who's ""we""?
How come you're doing this?
That's what I hear.
Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Of course but there's more --
Standing right here in my office.
Him or the President.
I'm not sure what --
I'm saying we're just friends.
""We'll all have lunch.
Sir I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.
See me sir?
Then good night.
Across the board sir.
Is that what you're after?
No sir WHAT?
It's you sir.
And it started the day I came here.
Pardon the hour sir.
Take your leave.
Sir I just want you to know...
I'm not here to make a statement.
Then that's all I have to say.
None at this time sir.
Really I have no problem with --
I'm fine sir.
No problem sir!
Fine by me sir!
Shit she was part of it!
Think we're had.
Got a call this morning from --
Did you hear?
White House boys want a private meeting.
Case in point...
No more test cases.
Come work for me.
I wanted the choice.
That's how it should've been.
Or thought you did.
Should probably ask him that.
Did you set me up?
Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?
You know him.
Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Would I be the only one?
The only woman?
Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.
I know that sir.
What the hell is the President trying to do?
Then I suggest we start there.
Heard some bad things.
It's him.
Why is there a break in that line?
Just do it okay?
I can make this wall without --
Of course it is.
Maybe mine maybe yours.
She's an officer.
Why are you coming down so hard?
I've had it.
Get it up!
This one'll be no different.
I was looking for him earlier but...
He wanted you to have it.
He was very clear on that point.
If I'm the only --"
Where you been the last few years?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Thank you, sir.
But I like these just fine.
Which is guy-speak for...
So here we are again.
I'd sure like to know who.
Well pardon me if I do.
Now who else?
This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.
What about him.
Almost like someone put him up to it.
Did I say he was class officer?
And this class officer...
""  You think he was just trying to get even?
All I wanted was an honest chance.
So why are you telling me this?
How they're talking about you?
Well not this.
I feel like there's men here there's women here -- then there's men.
But hey what'd I expect?
How hard they making it on you?
Much less keep up with my phone life.
I've been trying you for five days.
Really thank you so much.
You know right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
But I'm trying to be honest okay?
Three years is a long time.
And either do you.
Maybe we should just let it happen.
What happens if it works?
I'll try to keep the door open.
But after our days...
So if I try this thing...
what happens here?
Especially at night.
It has everything to do with you.
This has nothing to do with you.
Just like you would be.
Hate this part.
So that's the problem -- we can get the team in just not out.
thought I'd ask.
Just you know nothing special.
I think you look beautiful.
And know I remember why.
How'd you get through this part?
To get from here to there?
Brother said it was worth it.
Worth the training...
That's a good story.
You really came back for more?
Especially at your age.
And how do you know that?
It was made clear.
That's hell-and-a-half.
To your face anyway.
Well now I feel so much better.
They're more afraid of you.
How much air in yours?
She part of the training?
That's exactly what they --
Shut up sir.
What's your air situation?
Now try me.
Good to see you again too sir.
Just like your men do.
Or are you?
That's not right.
I mean depends on --
Should I be afraid?
Right here right now.
We'll try to get it for you.
No reason not to answer.
What is your father's name?
May I ask what you got it for?
Say again sir?
Mark it mark it!
What the hell you waiting for?
I just wonder how that happened.
I'm here to stay.
I'll take this one.
says I can.
Hey hey HEY.
Well who the shit you think you are?
I'm trying to eat here.
A man-in-place.
Okay so now work it from the other end.
She thinks I do but...
The White House.
Thought you knew I knew.
You knew about us?
Go in there.
Talk to her.
You where the one...
In the bedroom.
Who the hell are all these people?
See ya then.
How can you eat like that?
Oh yes he will.
Only one way to find out.
Think we can fit up in there?
Look you want to make it up to your friend?
Well if he's right this is your chance.
You wanted a story well baby you got one.
I just saw him.
Why are you asking?
What have I become?
That's my report!
Sure I was.
Nearly four years...
You know how I spent last weekend?
Oh just some insurance guy.
I'd like to find out.
I know a way.
That's why I needed this story so bad.
You're supposed to be my friend.
You never said it was off the record.
That's why he came to New York.
What else do you know about it?
I got pretty close.
How close did you get to that thing?
The first of its kind.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Eight years is a long time.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
That was eight years ago.
Some people change you know.
You just left me without a phone call a letter nothing.
That's what you always wanted to be right?
Really I am.
So you made it.
I'll take them all.
There's a story here.
That's the problem.
I know that guy.
I know him!
After everything I've done for him.
Can I use some?
What's it to you?
Remember you work for me.
We did it!
You got my bag?
I've got something on this.
Take me with you.
It's your choice.
So have dinner with me tonight.
And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me.
And you're beautiful...
What else did he say?
He said he'd consider it.
Just tell me did you talk with him?
This is not the place...
I'm sorry about all this.
That's over three million people.
Has that ever been done before?
More than that.
Is she always like this?
Not for a long time now.
Perhaps I work too much.
How did Mrs.
You will have to go and get help!
That is when we will go in.
And how should we do that Sir?
Only five Sir.
Get your people out of there or I will.
Major what do you think could have done this?
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
That is our job.
They are with me!
Who are they?
oh my God she took it.
You gave them the tape?
It may be too late by then.
I had to draw them out.
What do we know?
Somebody must have seen it.
You're standing on it.
You have any idea what that means?
That thing's dead.
We should be able to take him down.
What'd they say?
They should get you through.
How do I do that?
I think we should leave now.
I thought there would be more.
Makes us look more American.
So you're in?
Where we first found the fish.
I love my country.
Can you understand that?
There is nothing you can not buy.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
We have already taken care of them.
Why do you need that?
Why are you telling this to me?
Sounds like a big company.
Oh yeah the insurance guy.
We've met before.
Do I know you?
Are you looking for this?
Not so bad.
What are you doing in there?
What did we talk about?
Where's my bed?
I'm sorry sir I was only-
Well good that's very...
Good was done this.....
""Oh but what's this?
Well  you have to figure out what it wants...
Well I'm open to ideas!...
I heard something.
You go first!
There's no time!
Is that ten miles?
A hundred miles?
About this much.
WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
Like YOU know?
We've got to stop!
""The show must go on.
You WILL go out there.
Come on old friend...
As a matter of fact I do.
Look at their eyes.
Why are you listening to this man?
What's happened?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
There's nothing to think about!
He wants to THINK!?
Nobody was WATCHING?
Look at that...
Will you LOOK at that...
They look like little children...
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
May I get the check?
I'm doing it!
We heard it the first time!
All this from watching the..
Oh my god It's real.
A boy comes to the door.
You could order something in.
Oh good there's nothing to eat.
How did I come to this?
That's It?
They're off again.
No wait are you-
All right you're almost there.
TIME TO GO!
Okay that's where you want to be.
"" Should be down at the far end to your left.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay now what.
Okay now left at the next turn...
Make a right there.
Okay you can go on in...
Okay we got it.
I knew it!...
I KNEW it!...
All of it It's real.
I mean obviously it's all just a-
Yes I know and I want you to know I thought about what you said...
What's  your name son?
It's a television show.
We need another one.
There is no weather in space.
What's the weather like outside?
Any of it!
Look at this room!..
Oh and wait wait listen to this!
What does that mean?!!!
Yes I see!
It means that perhaps...
You're Mr.
You can do this.
You did this for four years on the show.
You can do it now...
I'll think on it...
I'm a dead man anyway.
Oh I make it up.
How do you remember this stuff?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Something BAD happened here.
Now I'm a whole person!
Guy you HAVE a last name.
Call me Guy.
Get off the line Guy.
Do you know WHY?
Yeah what is it?
Your last name.
Oh I'm not?
I'm not?
Then what's my last name?
They're still behind us...
Put me back on with him.
We made it.
We made It.
Where'd they go?
The wall of fire.
Hey YOU want to drive?
More to the left...
Well forget it!
Why is it HERE?
What IS that thing?
But I know somebody who does.
I think I can take it though...
Yes I'm here!
Can you hear me?
You're playing your good side.
I could have held on to YOU!
They're not but...
Oh my god.
Are they behind us?
There's nobody here.
I need time to think.
We have no right to do this.
It's not the STUFF.
I mean anybody can learn the STUFF...
Well you have to tell them.
What if something happens?
Who we are.
So that's what they built.
Let me try.
How much of a nothing?
I come in for an hour at most.
It's a nothing.
I can try.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
I heard it too.
Face it he's dead.
Sure no problem.
I mean he almost looked...
You should have let me hit him.
He's not worth it.
That's it It's go time.
You are so full of shit
This is great!
An hour and a half late.
An hour and a half!
Then tell me one thing...
Just give me a moment to set it up.
I'm not even sure where it is or even...
Listen I'm  I'm sorry about that whole...
I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people...
God I hope so I feel just awful about that.
As big as this!...
It's difficult to...
I'm not him...
I'm a nothing.
But there it is!...
NO Thank God he has not.
You kids are great.
But listen the guy gives you any more trouble just give a call...
Take a left here?
"" Time to get back to ""Earth kids.
You mean Earth?
Where are you...
As you wish.
The thing with the thing.
We've got to get out of here.
NO NO NO.
Go for the eyes.
It just went off.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, right, sorry.
Okay, I'll do this...
Hold it down.
Could be this.
It's as far as it goes!
Get us out of here!
Well it's...
Where are we?
That's right...
"" That's what I said.
Fire at will.
There they are
But sir my MEN.
Continue forward sir?
What does she see in them?
They always say that.
Cut those men down.
Have you heard?
There then you can have sort of a normal life.
They're ready.
Of course we get nothing from Congress.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
You all know my history.
Well George who were you?
Ah if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
I hope I never have to believe that.
You or them.
Then I need you.
It's what they want.
Is that a fact.
I want to hear everything.
Oh they have reasons...
Why in hell would John do that?
Why in hell would any of them do that?
They died well.
Over three hundred miles.
Well what have you thought?
A lot of years have gone by.
Do you understand!?
Yes my lord.
No my lord.
In this weather?
Who is that!?
What do you know about these men!?
They can stand against anything!
They are not afraid!
More than that sir...
I'm happy you've decided to join us.
Will you do it?
But it's more than just that am I right?
Well if it's my last order then I order them to be there!
Tell them I will give them my decision then.
Yes I believe so.
Get them all!
No one knows...
Who wrote this!?
But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we part!
Sir I think no such thing.
Then they start coming back to us.
That young school teacher...
It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
Well sir then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
I'll be twenty next year sir.
Who the hell knows?
friends of Congress.
what is happening here?
Who are those people in there?
George I'm sorry.
But he would have died before he would have let me down.
It's people like these who as soon as they get a little power want more and more.
You think that?
Oh come now...
Let's not over do it...
For this moment!
How can you say that?
No I did not.
Surely you knew that.
So good to be back!
I understand George.
What can he do?
They mean to finish us.
He's up there.
I feel the same sir.
Get these men back in line!
When we see them.
I only meant...
they look both the same.
none just now but...
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
I want you to see our hospital.
They're good people.
What is that supposed to mean?
If we win this war they will own this country too!
Some things must never change.
I think I heard that.
But then I believe she always looked down on us.
You never have been.
I'm very aware of that.
My God what?
Of course if it were that simple.
They're after something else...
But to go to war over trade over money?
I did not!
There's no middle ground at all?
Surely you knew this was coming.
My God these people mean to go to war!
They really mean it.
we'll have a country.
It is; we need you George.
Well this must be about something!
It's all right boys I'm here!
What the hell are we doing?
Then maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps...
We're all of us after something.
I know what I'm after.
I mean why would you want to win the war?
It's their nature.
Maybe I will let you down yet.
As was I.
Yes yes happy to meet you.
but which I now see means us all.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Do you hear?
You get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love!
And what is this then?
George you know I only love you but...
You know very well who it is that I love.
Words words words!
Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Hear that George?
That's not what I said!
Oh but you must not mind my talking about you!
You're out of your mind!
What else should I become?
Well we must be who we must be...
When I saw those men yesterday in the field...
Perhaps you best ask why you wish it.
as I said it's completely stupid.
It's stupid of course.
Well I've never seen anything like it so...
That's so far?
How do they get here?
do those men come from George?
Who says so?
He was not black!
This this is life indeed!
We'll get it later.
Trade for what?
You get the money?
After this one I'm out Cat you understand?
This is the last time we talk to each other.
I'm out of it Cat.
I'm done.
You see the paper?
So where's the money?
He knew it was a set up.
He was ready for it.
And I mean high up in it.
You see that?
The way the man just went right over?
What're some of 'em?
Not too bad.
What's he ever done he can talk about?
You feel okay?
Then we might have something to talk about.
You think I'd be standing here?
Can you remember that?
After we'll come here get our money.
That's a lot.
Now why would you do that?
You gave him the money?
I gave the man his money sent him on his way.
He comes up here with our product.
I know how that goes.
She's great.
In the can.
That the money?
I'll find it.
You can have the money...
but it's not here.
I have to go get it.
In just a second.
I need the money.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
You know how to write one of these?
Yeah I read it.
I was just thinking you could make her older.
I'm with you on that.
And the guy's name.
I missed that one.
Or hey you know who else?
I wonder would that work?
No shit come on.
That's right me.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
So let me put it this way...
But first I want to know who I'm talking to.
Am I talking to you or am I talking to him?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Boy this town.
I'm working on a few things.
It's a different kind of deal.
You positive about that?
Makes no difference to me which one our money's in.
Then be good enough to hand us our money back or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Yeah where've you been?
That's correct.
You say look at you?
Or else what?
and took a meeting with Mr.
Never heard of him.
So who are you?
I'm very for real.
Yeah I'm here.
That's who I am.
Forget that too.
Why would I do that?
Get up and turn around.
I told them I was you.
How'd you get in here?
You a quick draw...
's an open city.
You want something talk to me.
What like that's supposed to mean something to me?
Get him out've here.
That's what I'd do.
Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Maybe you'll find it.
I love it out here.
I just started.
You have a card in here?
Yeah why not.
What've you got?
Jesus these fucking names...
You have it?
I found him.
A meeting with who?
You're fifty feet in the air!
I say what I mean.
I want something from someone I ask 'em straight out.
I said I'd think about it.
In this town nothing.
Next thing I know you're saying yeah maybe they can have a piece of Mr.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I had to tell 'em something.
But I thought...
Do not tell 'em who I am.
They'll be looking at you.
No leave 'em up we want the light in their eyes.
Let's see how we get along.
What do you get out of this?
Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Just a thought.
So what's the problem?
One of his best parts.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Let's just get to where you're at okay?
I've been picked up a couple times.
Maybe a few times I have.
They always paid.
What I did till recently.
Is that right that's what you do for a living?
Wait a minute you're not the guy are you?
Part of it yeah.
I said I had an idea that's all.
As a matter of fact...
He's in it to make money.
I mean the way you told it to me.
You just did.
You want to hear this idea?
Go on tell her.
How you doing?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
How far you want to go with this?
That's what I'm doing.
I want you to keep looking right here okay?
I'm looking at you.
Come over here and sit down.
Tell me what you been up to.
We just did.
Twenty seven hundred.
Ask your man here.
Hey it's your book now.
Check with the wife.
Yeah he told me.
How'd you know he died he tell you?
You got a miss.
Guy's six weeks over.
I think you got it down.
Yeah I like it I'm high up I can see everything you know?
At that point basically that has to be it.
You have to be careful.
Wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
Good-looking too.
How do I know that?
No I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you.
The pressure got to you?
One of mine?
If you'd like to tell me yeah.
So you want to know.
We talk different?
Well you had it down cold.
It was a beautiful role.
That was a good party.
At eighteen percent okay?
It's all mine.
You can keep what you won today.
That's yours.
By taking my money?
How'd you know I was here?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case.
Who told you that?
You're here a while what's wrong with a bank?
Where would you?
I know who he works for.
Where's your phone.
Is that what you're telling me?
It's not one of these?
Go get your stuff.
I thought that was...
I'm so sorry...
It's not Dave.
You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I just meant in general.
There's a girl in it now.
That's a different story.
That's real life.
So what about your story.
Oh I like him.
I just think he's...
They have no idea what things cost.
He wants to have lunch tomorrow.
That is if you can make it.
Tell me you're not really that stupid.
I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
I was never much into it.
That why you came over here to ask me that?
There a part in it for you?
Then you've read it?
Or the main guy's name.
I think it's not horrible.
I already read it.
You been here the whole time?
With or without my help.
He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
That was a full- time job.
You saw that one?
What're you doing here?
A hundred and fifty-six.
So three a week's not too bad.
But a week.
That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
What if it was?
No it was open.
What're you talking about?
He already knew it.
You tell him?
I hate to say I told you but I did.
I told you not to -
That's what the guy said.
And you already got a job.
So what's the --
That look was so...
Get down here.
Yeah what'd he have to say?
You seem to feel fine about it.
I'm being honest.
And I would know.
Made him what he was.
Oh yeah sure.
You go on off to bed.
Yeah that's what we need.
That's where you got the idea?
It's not bad so far.
Sit down have a drink.
How did you get in the house?
It needs it.
Yeah well I turned off the set.
You know what could've happened?
The three hundred large.
What other money is there?
I have to run.
But you are interested?
How did it all...
Over and out.
It's Friday.
What day is it?
Hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later?
Where's his boat then?
It's a beautiful country.
It's just one of those things.
Then what the hell happened to him?
When I got there I found him on the floor.
I'm no doctor.
Maybe that is his boat.
I'm telling you I saw somebody.
But I saw somebody.
I like my job.
Yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong?
Ever heard of insurance big boy?
Any other questions?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
You think that's funny
What is your first name?
You're up first.
Then you're a lucky man.
If money can buy what he wants.
What the hell happened!
You better get down here right now!
We're taking water!
What about the radio?!
Oh yeah the radio.
Maybe you can tell me then.
I think you know.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Part of that up there's mine.
I got a question.
What exactly is the plan?
I think you better see this for yourself.
Do what you need to do.
If he's reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal.
We'll stand a watch.
Four on eight off.
Low man first.
Not in the eyes of the law.
We found her.
She's ours.
So we get a little more for the boat.
It looks like it.
It's ours.
That's the big question right?
Either way they must've had a pretty good reason.
Or somebody stopped them.
And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
What you think there's something funny about it?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
She take a radio?
Three four days.
How long then?
What about running number two by itself?
But how long?
The right way and the wrong way.
I know I know two ways to do anything --
Like I always say --
So we take it easy.
If you get it back in one piece.
I just thought I heard something is all.
Maybe six feet.
He was far away.
But I saw him.
I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
What'd he look like?
I like it cold.
That's a good thing?
I wish I could believe that.
Either way you know what I've done.
I've got no choice.
Nobody ever does.
I think I see it pretty well.
The way I figure it it was them or me.
Bought a little time.
Us and your...
You saw it coming as well as I did.
It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
We hit land.
Not like him.
Maybe it was more than that.
Leave him till we can get some help.
From now on nobody comes down here.
What do we do with him?
That we had to leave right away.
It was more than that.
One second she was there the next she was gone.
I'm not sure she was...
I'd seen...
Before your time.
What do you think happened on this boat?
Wish I could say the same.
Let 'em ask.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
He was probably out of the picture by then.
the radio's out.
Only something must've gone wrong.
They're dead in the water that morning.
I'll try again later.
I'll call us in.
He needs a doctor.
Got your light?
How's the food situation?
So we find this guy and make a deal with him.
It was somebody else.
Of course I'm sure.
Just a minute ago.
What the hell're you talking about.
There's somebody else on this boat.
He just came this way.
Did you see him?
Why not call for help?
Only way to be.
But we'll never really know for sure.
So what did happen?
The table was even set for dinner.
Well suppose she got a little further north than she should have.
They write it off.
The question is where the hell's she been since.
What'd you find up there?
The law's on our side.
Who knows could be more.
Could be a lot more.
Fine with me.
Now hold up just a minute.
Let's be reasonable here.
They'll send somebody out soon enough.
This' is where we get off!
I'd be real interested to know myself.
Any idea what you might've seen?
You've been out for about a day.
Drink up then.
And look what happened.
We'll have to take it easy then.
Pretty low all around.
Would you hold on just a minute here please?
It's a big boat.
Let's just take it easy here alright?
Fifty million four ways.
That's twelve million and change a piece.
We could call for help.
We leave it where it is.
Stick to the plan.
Not for fifty million.
Maybe forty fifty million.
You're up late.
We've done it before.
It's funny.
Let's check her out.
I'll be right up.
Makes me think it might be in trouble.
You got that right.
I must be in the wrong business.
Of course they did.
I heard you.
As I said what seems to be the trouble?
After my guy looks at it.
Fifteen at the most.
Better late than never.
I thought you say Tuesday.
JUST DO IT!
Tell him I'm not here!
What do you mean ""on his way up""!?
I-I'm not sure...
She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Are you still looking for a job?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Do you want some?
Someone from the past.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
You could even live here and go to the city college part time and still get a job if you wanted to.
Will you get off my back for once?
We're almost done.
Right great sounds good!
But what do I know?
Oh all right...
Just let me put a few things away.
No really I --
Here just follow me...
watch my feet.
where is this?
Here we are...
When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so...
I had to give it to someone else...
But I'm sure next year I can --
Help me what?
I'm so sorry about what happened.
This could be a great thing for you.
I'm not sure...
And what can you tell us about this...
Well lose it!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Look that's the policy...
You already got his money...
Are you ready to go?
Just take my word for it...
How long have you been up?
That's just the way I am!
Then why do you hate me so much?
well why not?
What's so wrong with me?
What do you mean ""why""?
Do you want something to drink?
what's up?
Oh my God that's HIM!
Jesus look at this guy.
That's not him...
He's back there.
You could walk there in two minutes.
Look can we talk in a minute?
I'm almost done.
I simply wish to know --
Look I'll be done in a minute.
Just wait outside.
It just came yesterday...
Do you want anything?
Actually he's a really nice guy.
I have to show you something else!
So where's all your stuff?
Of course it's a good idea...
it's our plan.
Please let me come with you.
Please please please...
I'm moving in next week.
I'm sorry about the other day.
I really do want to move in with you.
There's something wrong with every single place we look at!
Well what am I supposed to say?
Oh yeah I can tell you really love it!
I said ""great""...
It looks totally normal...
what's wrong with it?
Twenty-seven fifty-three...
do you see it?
That must be it...
When was this?
He came into work.
I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Yeah well you said you were busy...
I'll call you tomorrow.
Just some people from work...
Actually I'm just about to go out with some friends...
So should I come over?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Look we have to get these...
Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Do you want to do something tonight?
I thought everything must go!
Everything must go!
you wanted to move out right then!
Yeah maybe it'll be okay.
God I wish that was my job...
Face it you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
See that guy?
Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
I'm working on it...
But those are our people...
You'll see...
He does that every single day.
Where did you get that?
I totally totally hate you.
I know a party we could go to...
Let's get out of here this place makes me sick.
when did you get that?
How about this one?
Everybody's too stupid!
It'll only take a second.
I hate this place.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
There he is...
How long have you been standing there?
Jesus you're out of your mind.
What is she black now?
We're not sure yet that's why we're looking.
you know what I mean.
This one would be okay but there's no kitchen...
I kind of like him...
Hey here's one...
Come on it's too late now...
What should we do?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
We should follow him home.
Do you think he knows?
He's still just sitting there.
What's he doing now?
It's obviously him!
I want to ""make love"" to him.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
Look maybe that's him!
he's like an old man.
What does it stand for?
You're better at it.
Why do I always have to do it?
What are you talking about -- who?
I want to do him!
No she was the second wife.
I remember every minute of that party.
I've been looking all over for this.
Hey - why do you have this?
I just want to see what's on this tape.
So what should we do?
Oh we totally have to.
Listen to this one: ""Do you remember me?
Okay well here's yours...
Not this one!
You can have that one.
What does that even mean?
Hey look at this...
Or maybe not.
In fact never.
We should follow them!
We've been waiting for this our whole life!
I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Just look at them!
Look at these people behind you.
God think about that...
Oh my god look!
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
This is so bad it's almost good.
Both of you?...
Am I not even here?
I love this place...
I'm just on my break.
Oh yeah that'll definitely happen...
We have to get together this summer!
Listen young lady...
May I ask what you're doing?
I'd love to hear about what you're doing.
You still interested in that?
That's okay...
Absolutely no practice necessary.
I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
How much is this?
Get a job!
Yeah yeah yeah.
Do you have my money?
That's not even --
Tell me what?
are you waiting for a bus?
what's your name?
I did too!
Did you bring that tape?
Fine and how are you?
Why do you even want it?
It would look stupid on you.
Well why do I care about that?
I really want to talk to you.
I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
You must know I always...
did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I will if you want to.
Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
Be a man for once in your life!
I-I-I...
I'm just so sick of everybody!
Let's just go...
So where would we go?
You know what we should do?
Let's go get in your car right now and just take off!
We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life...
Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Yeah well I like you too...
Maybe I should just move in here with you...
We're good friends right?
of course I...
Yeah but still...
You're a beautiful young girl...
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date you never asked me out?
Jesus how can you stand her?
Where did you get this?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
You better not --
Do you have anything to drink?
In whatever way you think I mean.
In what way do you mean?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
Just someone so young...
What does she mean by that - ""somebody like me""?
What's her problem anyway?
No of course I do...
It's just that right now I need to --
what do I know about clothes...
And you like them?
Well when can we do something?
I -- it's just that I --
let's do something else.
I better not...
Of course you should.
There's something I have to show you...
He wants to be of course.
I-I'm sorry...
What are you trying to get rid of me?
I-I'll definitely call you this week --
she's trying anyway...
Yeah I'll bet!
I know I'm sorry...
I-I've been really busy...
I've been looking all over for you...
I'll talk to you later...
Yeah so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Actually it's kind of still happening...
she's over here right now...
So what happened?
A long time ago...
she called before once...
Let the machine get it.
Oh wait you met him...
Then again that's easy for me to say since I'll never even get a date.
It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Yeah well you're not the only one.
It's just my stupid back.
I'll be all right in a minute...
You can open your eyes now.
Maybe it would be better if you --
No in a lot of ways things are better now...
what more do I want?
For nineteen years...
I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink...
there might be some --
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...
What did you tell that girl?
You want me to do it?
Yes that would certainly do...
So why did you bring this along?
OH MY GOD!
Fine I'll go by myself then...
We have to!
I - I'd really rather not...
We have to go in here!
Let's just say ""music"" - that way you only use up one...
Wait we have to go in here for a second...
Well let's see...
Yeah yeah yeah...
Every guy has a type!
Okay what about this one?
Would you go out with her?
I'm totally serious!
I'm talking to you...
No you're not!
Yeah well sure...
you can if you want to...
Oh God no.
You're right about that.
Watch my stuff.
Do you want to see it?
I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah that's good too...
Is this one any good?
There's some good stuff in here...
do you like old music?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy.
It could be a million things.
Yeah I'm really really happy.
Really having a good time.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I wish I could see him.
Forget it there's no way...
I can see that...
now what can you tell us about it?
Talk to us about it...
Look what do you expect?
Did she say that?
Did she say anything to you about me?
I have no idea - I just want to...
What did she tell you?
where is she then?
I really need to talk to her.
She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
they said she was here...
She's not at home?
Do you have a check for me?
You're doing all the work.
Thank you doctor.
Do you think that's too soon?
It's really...
So tell me more about this job.
What exactly will you be doing?
As are they all.
It's best you get out.
You think you matter?
Oh you're a doctor now too?
Let me see the sick.
I'm sure we'll meet again.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Understand I had help-
Very well the job's still yours I'll go.
Am I not fair?
Told you you'd hate me.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind.
And it worked?
Well I need to speak to him.
Is he here?
How could it be?
And be finished in four months time.
Can you do that?
I'm sure you agree.
Then why do it?
You're certain about tomorrow?
Then why do you stay?
Who needs it?
You never had it.
Then we agree.
I suppose I could answer you.
-is it I'm sorry but then of course you're the doctor you should know.
That's a terrible idea-
-not ""what if""- there will be there always are.
-well it's just...
I tried to be late John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Very good indeed.
We all worked together.
You mean nobody died?
What a good week.
That's what the books say...
But you said they were always old.
John it will not be easy.
How lucky we are.
Why not indeed!
I'd love the company.
Why ""of course""?
"" As if it were the most normal thing in the world.
Come along to the hospital when you're done.
Have you got that in writing?
We all have our reasons.
Almost three hours.
But I've been getting ready all my life.
How long have you been here?
Anything special about them?
You think they'll come then?
Was that supposed to make me feel better?
I'll have to.
Where could it have gone?
How could it get across the water?
Nobody's seen anything like this.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
I got big.
But he was not the problem.
He had a brother who was worse than he.
But the brother was not the problem.
You just got hit.
But of course yours worked.
They know it's there.
Only in life...
Think about something else.
Has it ever done that before?
No but you do-  -see you were needed after all.
Have you got it?
See any problems?
Got me out of trouble.
What did I do?
He has children?
It seemed a good idea once.
He needs nobody.
Why does he need you by him?
You've known him long?
But it takes time.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
You give me hope John.
I do actually; very much.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Oh yes I think so.
What are they looking at?
This is more difficult-
Did it look like this in your mind?
Hold your son high.
Too soon to tell.
Where do you go next?
Any questions ask them now.
And stay there.
Why so many?
They will want a lot of money.
Four should do it.
I'd rather not.
He's not taking my baby.
Not in this case my dear.
Everybody has a choice.
What do you want with my baby?
Okay just thought I'd check.
No everything's fine.
Do you need anything?
You want me to come in?
Is the baby all right?
Perhaps some other time.
Every day I ask you and every day you've got something else to do.
In fact I'd better go.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.
Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
You know you are really doing very good work here.
Will you call me?
How is he these days?
Do you ever see him?
I'm not saying you did.
That's exactly what you said last week.
Okay that's no problem.
I asked you last week.
I'll get the hang of this eventually.
It's not my job but what the hell.
It's a free country.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I think I do too.
Why do you say things like that?
You're so much better than you know.
I'm not even good for me.
All right you want to be real?
For one night in your life do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Next time ask me first okay.
Okay but it's not a date.
It's a dinner.
I brought some of your clothes.
I'm not here to date.
So what do I do now?
I'll put him down for you.
You are way too short!
I think I should put him down now.
Or we could do that.
If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
No they're all right.
They're here now...
Let me know.
We'll take care of that.
You better stay here.
No I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
Were you on your way out?
Good-bye Peter.
You know what it needs?
You're really good you know.
Oh hello Peter.
I always land on my feet.
I'm like a cat.
I wish I could stay.
Okay let's take a look.
We definitely had a moment or two.
Peter this is serious.
He's got his father's looks.
It's just horrible.
So what happened to Mr.
Let's go to work boys.
I'm still into all this stuff you know.
A little to the left.
That's where it stopped.
Thanks for coming.
Anyway we're just about out of time.
Oh you think so?
Well I've got news for you.
And that's just round one.
Look I've had it with you.
This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Now you're talking.
That's quite a story.
You read me?
I just want to say hello to him.
Oh yeah sure -- no.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?
Do they know you're doing this?
We should stay.
Should we go?
I'd like to have a baby myself.
It's really not a bad place.
Oh sure that sounds great.
What are you doing up here?
We're not moving.
Did you back the wrong horse.
We'll be back.
So you see everything is in order is it not?
If she says it looked at her it looked at her.
I'm talking to you.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
You know I never got to ask you.
Your name was first.
Then why have you come?
I'll let you get back to it.
Nice meeting you.
I've seen you on television.
Bring me the child that I might live again.
What was will be what is will be no more.
Find me a child that I might live again.
You've got to stop them.
You've got to do something!
Did I forget something?
That's all you have to say?
Can I have some of your water?
I just come in on the big ones.
Okay I'll meet you there.
Then you should go to the police.
I could get in a lot of trouble.
You were the one who got me in.
You're a doctor.
Do this for me.
This is not just some money-making scheme!
I mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right?
Yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
So what are you saying?
That's where we come in.
I've been there.
Good party town.
So far so good.
It's working.
Let's save this until tomorrow okay?
Sounds better and better.
""I'll be back?
A hundred and five years?
You were supposed to help me with this.
I knew that.
Yeah you would.
Just do it!
I've had it with you.
Who wants it first?
Nine feet -- ten --
It's on the bottom.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Just before his head died his last words were ""Death is but a door time is but a window.
No not exactly a man of the people.
And we're the...
This one's interesting.
Come up with anything?
I'm a little of everything.
And that's what made this country great.
Oh right you told me that.
The whole city's together on this one.
Everybody's down on you you know.
She's new in town.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Yeah sorry I missed it.
Let me know what you find out.
We thought you might want to come along.
Work with me baby.
Let's finish up and get out of here.
Listen to this:
Oh good you're here.
He's a mean one.
I'm Peter --
If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.
I love this.
We're onto something really big.
Just -- someone we know.
I'm kind of working on something.
Oh hello perhaps you could help me.
She's moving!
No I just thought --
Are you telling me how to drive?
No I'm fine.
You coming down with something?
You finished here?
After all we did for this city.
You're living in the past.
Then let's do it.
It better not start yet.
Have I done the right thing?
Well thanks a lot.
It probably would've been the same.
Just give me a second here.
I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Well you're doing great.
They're just coming to me.
Five for five.
You're very good.
All right what happened to me?
Not that I remember anyway.
I'm getting used to this.
We'll stop in for a drink.
Bring her too.
I'll make some more though.
I thought I turned it off.
I'll stop by if I'm around.
Oh no I feel great.
This one took some work.
Is it gone?
We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
You've got two people in there already.
Take me now.
Well I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Do you want this body?
As long as we're waiting for him I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Okay I'll help you.
I'll pick you up at your place.
Since you put it that way.
I'm busy Thursday night.
I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
What's that say?
He is a very close friend.
about my case?
You're good.
You heard it?
Then I'll go.
I think I should spend the night here.
I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
This is terrible.
It happened by itself.
I told you I...
Well let's check it out.
Is that the kitchen?
What's in there?
What do I act like?
I'm not ready to do that.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
So what do you think it was?
There was nothing there.
That would definitely explain it.
He's a big one.
We'll get back to you.
Back off man!
One thing at a time.
Thank you for coming.
Are you the men from the University?
Keep it anyway.
I have another one at home.
I want you to have this.
I think it's the food of the future.
It's a great game!
I bet you'd be good.
Is that a game?
I read a lot myself.
Do you ever play?
I bet you like to read a lot too.
What's he want?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Up until two weeks ago...
It was never ever this bad though.
Has this ever happened before?
Thank you for coming so quickly.
You can believe Mr.
You turned off the power!
Look there was another man here...
You have to find him and bring him back.
Make yourself useful!
Have it your way Mr.
Get a court order.
I want to know more about what you do here.
Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Why do you want to see it?
And why not Mr.
Yes it would.
You could say that.
Exactly what are you a doctor of Mr.
I'll tell you the effect!
What's this one?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
On Earth -- no.
Let me ask you something.
I just want to see 'em.
Now what do you want?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Life is just a state of mind.
All right Peter.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
You have to keep him there.
I was just thinking.
He's here with me now.
Are you there?
Does that make any sense to you?
Does she want to be?
I've got a problem.
What do you mean ""bad?
It will be bad.
Something was definitely here.
I'm starting to worry.
Did you see anything?
I'm always serious.
Do you remember that?
Oh this is big Peter.
This is very big.
There's definitely something here.
You're here.
It's working!
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Well that ought to do it.
Nobody ever built them like this!
It's looking at me.
Get down here
These things can sense them.
See I told you we'd get something.
Do you know when that might be?
How was your date?
I found the car.
This might do...
We're trying to keep our costs down.
You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
But at nineteen percent interest!
My parents left me that house I was born there.
To go into business for ourselves.
I've worked in the private sector.
You've never been out of college.
You never would've met if not for me.
That's got to be worth something.
I'm telling you this is a first.
You know what this could mean to the University?
""  That was your whole plan?
I know what to do.
I have a plan.
Can you talk?
This is not working.
Think of something else.
What do I say?
Talk to it.
I told you it's real.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do you mean by ""seen?
And what have you seen?
No this one's for real Peter.
We're close this time.
I can feel it.
I think you should get down there right away and check it out.
Let me know what happens.
Can you come back in about an hour?
You okay in there?
We'll believe anything.
What is it you're so involved with there?
Now tell me what you really do.
What have I got now?
Someone who will look good.
Send them out!
Not yet dear brother...
What is that...
I have to come back.
You're coming back?
If it's worth something then sell it!
Let some time pass...
Forget about him.
Surely you can drink more than that.
And stay there?
That's what you told me two days ago!
I know you would give anything to be outside again.
Think of it.
They love you.
Where is my family?
You and my father have become very close.
Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Or perhaps into a new one.
Then you'd be out of a job.
That's difficult to say general.
Of course but not now.
Likely just the weather.
It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Give away food?
What if you do throw something to the people they really want?
You know that's not a bad idea.
If it's my father they want then give him to them!
You are paying for it you know...
How can they?
Who else is there?
and he knows it.
What you want is to...
For the poor.
He must have been.
Where is my father?
You understand what you are doing...
well who are you?
Will you write it?
So I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
But the war's over time to close the door of war once and for all.
But have never been?
I've read of it.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You'd have to give me your word.
That's who I hear you are.
I took care of it all.
All of them.
How like my father you are.
But that was something.
Yours will do!
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?
How do you know I am playing?
And how did you ever get to know me so well?
The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.
I think you know me better than my father.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
You're too hard on him.
Everyone talking about it?
It's a start only a start.
So I understand.
His sister is a better man.
There's no reason to say that.
As soon as I can.
Can you free these men?
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!
It's my job to keep my job.
They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Well we can try...
What the hell do you think it was about?
What the hell was all that about?
They'll have me.
You tell the girls that.
At the table of life.
If I live I'll come and get you.
Half a year?
You have to stay with us!
Save my family.
If you win you know you have to stay.
The war is over.
You've won!
You need to come home!
Well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Something else then.
Let's talk about this later.
so to speak.
So things change.
I'll do it!
Right right what am I thinking of?
Tell them I'll do it.
A great deal.
How much money is involved?
Take your time!
Take my advice and make that bet.
It's absolutely not like that!
This is for your own good!
But -- you have to go out there!
I'll give you more than your one third!
When I get paid...
Better than the real thing!
General hang on...
Just think about it!
Make some very big money...
That's one way to look at it.
General do you realize what happened out there today?
Now show them what you can do!
We'll see...
And about you.
everything for me.
I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!
Death is a very light thing for you.
I own this school and everything that's in it.
You're in it!
and you act like one.
The day after tomorrow?
Where did he do it?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Well what did he say?
How did he do it?
Why do you have to see him?
We've known him for years.
All right -- I will.
I happen to have mine with me.
Where's yours?
Or this afternoon.
It's a good day for it.
You really will?
I have to go back now.
We just can.
How about tomorrow?
But you might.
I have two.
The other one is the one I'm looking for.
If you want.
I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
All right -- but listen to me.
What happened was there was this party at my parents.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Let me go.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Do you just hate everything?
Well I want you to leave.
All right then!
I said I think it is.
I think it is.
I want to ask you a question.
Here he comes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
I just sit in.
Is that him over there?
I've never been to it.
They have a pretty good one here do they?
Where are you meeting this person?
I'm meeting someone.
Get out of here.
Oh my God --
You mean the one who --
The older woman.
You sure you really want to?
During the day?
We'll go for a drive or something.
And it's all over now.
Did they ever find out?
She had a husband and a son.
With a family?
It was just this thing that happened along with everything else.
That is not my business.
The first person I could stand to be with.
Who is Mr.
Let's go somewhere else.
Of course there is.
I mean -- as far as I know.
I mean let's go see.
Let's go see if they do or not.
What is the matter?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Is anything wrong?
Would you like to come in?
I could make some coffee.
But could you try?
I'm not like this.
I hate myself like this.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
This whole idea -- this date and everything.
It was my parents' idea.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I just want to tell you something.
Where is the car?
I think I'd better go home now please.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Will you take me home now?
Could you do it?
No -- why should I?
Do you want some dinner?
Do you always drive like this?
You're living at home now.
I certainly hope you --
Is the doctor anywhere?
Hello -- who is this?
That's a deal.
Yes I will.
Exactly how do you mean?
Are you listening?
Could I make one phone call first?
I want you out of here.
I need to use the phone?
Out of here.
See -- she's just having some water.
Look -- she's all right.
But she's okay now.
What did you do to her?
But it's all right now.
It's all right Mr.
Oh -- hello Mr.
Oh -- no sir.
I like to know who's living in my house.
I like to know what my boys are up to.
What are you then?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
I'll be there in an hour.
Give me an hour.
Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Did you get a room?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Put it in the room where we were.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Could you bring it up?
Whatever you say sir.
Well actually I'd just as soon find it myself.
I can get it myself.
If that's all right.
Very good sir.
Well it's in the car.
It's out in the car.
Is anything wrong sir?
Just for myself please.
A single room or a double room?
I'd like a room please.
Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Can I help you sir!
What the hell have you done?
Would you like a quick drink before you go?
What have you done to her?
Just a second.
I'll ask him.
Get me the police please.
Go home now.
Is that clear?
Now it seems to me --
Do exactly what I say.
But I am.
Look we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back.
Now listen -- this was not my idea.
It was my father's idea.
Let's not talk about it.
Let's not talk at all.
Why the hell did you bring this up.
May I stay then?
It's not!
I enjoy it!
I look forward to it.
It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Look -- I like you.
But it's not.
If that's how you feel --
I'm sorry I said those things.
Of course you did.
And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Well I'm not.
You go straight to hell Mrs.
I'm not fit to --
I'm not good enough to even talk about her am I?
Let's hear your reasons Mrs.
Then let's hear them.
I have my reasons.
There's nothing to tell.
I wish you'd tell me.
Do you remember the make of the car?
What kind of car was it?
In the car you did it?
We'd go to his car.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him?
How do you think.
Well how did it happen?
Now what was your major subject at college?
Why are you asking me all this?
What was your major?
So how did it happen?
Now let's get to bed.
Well I never thought of you and Mr.
Why did you do that?
Well wait a minute.
Now let's --
When you first knew him.
Well how do you feel about him then?
Man is this interesting.
Sometimes on his birthday.
How many times a year.
Now and then.
About five years.
We're talking Mrs.
We're talking.
Now tell me.
What do you say to him?
You walk right out the door.
I walk out.
How do you get out of the house?
I mean everything.
There's something we could have a conversation about.
I got up.
Do you want to hear it or not?
Do you really want me to?
Tell me what you did today.
Can I take off my clothes now?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Well what do you want to know about it.
You start it off.
That's a good subject.
Leave it on!
Anything at all.
Well what do you want to talk about?
I mean are we dead or something?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
That you're afraid --
Who said it was my first time?
On your first time --
It is your first time.
Is this -- what?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together Mrs.
Are you afraid of me?
Oh no Mrs.
Either one will be fine.
They have both.
Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here?
Is that all right?
Well -- I'll see you later Mrs.
I think you ought to tell me that.
To tell you?
I'll be up in five minutes.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
But there's one thing.
I got a single room.
Well -- I will then.
Do you want to get it now?
Do you want me to get it?
I mean I could.
Or we could just talk.
Do you want to?
Did you get us a room?
May I have a drink?
May I sit down?
Thank you for taking me home.
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
I want to say something first.
Get away from that door.
On that chair in the hall.
I hope you can forget it.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Why is it?
But please Mrs.
This is difficult for me.
I wish you'd --
But they would!
I'm twice as old as you are.
How could anyone think --
But he might get the wrong idea.
What if he did?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr.
Yes I have --
Then why do you keep running away?
But I'm --
But I just feel a little funny.
I'd rather not Mrs.
I think I'll go to bed.
We had it done last Christmas.
Would you like to see it?
What is wrong with me?
We'll forget it right now.
Finish your drink.
Now finish your drink.
You give me a drink.
My husband will be back quite late.
Now I'm sure that Mr.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
You've known me nearly all of your life.
What do you think of me?
When is he coming back?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
What do you drink?
But I have some things on my mind.
But it's light in there now.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Will you come in please?
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?
Will you take me home?
Is what a girl?
Is it a girl?
It's down the hall.
I got it all right.
I say I've got it.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'll find your table in a moment.
Yes but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm not --
When did you two talk this over?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
But I want you to.
Please will you believe me.
Shall I tell you what I do?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Why did you say that?
Then what do you do?
Do you meet someone?
I drive around.
I want to tell you.
When I go off?
Can I talk to you a minute?
Say hello to Mrs.
No -- it's not.
It's a decision I've made.
I think you'll want to wait on that.
Say that again.
That has nothing to do with it --
You got me.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for?
What was the point of all that hard work?
To be what?
I want it to be --
I think I've talked about this enough.
You miss the point.
Well that's not saying much for my wife is it?
We got -- we got into bed with each other.
But it was nothing.
It was nothing at all.
That's quite a statement.
I've been here quite a while.
Now look -- please --
It was nothing to do with you sir.
No it's not --
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
What would you say to a short one?
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.
I want you to call her up this time.
Oh -- not too much.
Taking it easy.
What are you doing with yourself these days?
I'd like to hear it.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Quite a while.
How long have you and I known each other?
How long have we known each other now?
You'll never be young again.
I wish I was that age again.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I'll be twenty-one next week.
Thank you very much sir.
She's upstairs.
She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Yes I can.
Can you see me now?
Dad -- can you listen --
You better get out here.
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
Could I speak to you for a second Dad?
That what he says.
Your bank Mr.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look!
Turn 'em up.
If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
I have an idea working in my head...
I'll pay you back.
Get out and leave it to me...
You're no good for this business.
I know -- I had it in the war.
No -- no -- no -- no...
I could take care of her.
Need any help?
You've been waiting your chance.
I've been careful I've been waiting my chance.
Now listen to me.
I want to speak --
Time's getting short.
Have you a minute now?
You live here?
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Anything for you.
I thought that too -- but I found that it does.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Would you like to make a man happy?
I'll do anything for you.
That was lovely.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
You were very different yesterday.
I'd given you up.
You're very funny --
What time tomorrow?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...
Money -- Ever heard of it?
If you were free I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Have you seen it?
He must be very nice.
Yes I am rather.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
On the train?
Why do you think --
You wear them now...
I'll be on the train.
-- I love you.
I'll be on that train.
I'll get the money.
You must go now.
Be careful on your way to your room.
Never mind -- I'll get it.
I have a whole day.
Six twenty-seven in the morning...
But the money?
I will go with you.
When does the train leave?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Very early in the morning.
Shall I see you again?
I'll go -- good-bye.
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- yes -- yes.
But now you must go...
But now you must go ---
Please look at me.
You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
What a picture -- and what else?
And what do you do -- now?
None at all.
-- And how do you live?
What kind of a person are you?
But why should I be telling you this?
Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you really?
-- I do not even know your name.
Say I am to stay with you...
You are beautiful!
What can you see?
Just for a minute then.
Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Yes -- I do understand.
and what is she now?
-- I want you to understand.
You could love me.
It is so long since I have heard that word.
How is it that you -- Let me look at you.
Why could you love me?
Who are you --?
Later he was found dead.
I did not know you were so beautiful...
Why do you look at me like that?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come...
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
I have had a bad evening.
I am not afraid.
Shall I go?
Nothing -- only to be here.
What do you want here?
Here -- here it is.
I take five hundred.
You've lost everything?
That was my last.
No -- not at all.
We could come to my room.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
How do you feel now?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
We've been together all day...
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Then you know him?
What's the matter Mr.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Perhaps you could present me now Mr.
Yes I was in the war.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Well -- last night was not so good.
How's the beautiful lady?
Give me that money.
As you will.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
I did not ask your advice.
I know people...
Man -- that's terrible.
No -- no -- not yet.
Any news here?
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Is that for me?
Anyone asked for me?
Oh I've got to find it.
On the floor probably.
I've been everything.
Oh no Doctor.
The best shops the very best.
Look the price is on it.
Oh but Doctor.
I have nothing better to do Mr.
You will stay Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes --
Oh -- but -- I --
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
You're a good man Mr.
Do you like me better?
Will you stay with me until...
Here I'll give you the money I won three thousand four hundred.
Later you can have more.
I wanted to go there always.
You'll have a good time with me.
I've got enough money.
Three thousand four hundred that I won.
It will last a long time.
Will -- will you let me?
Yes of course -- money!
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened.
Go -- go at once -- Mr.
It's you --
Oh -- what -- what --
For the first time in my life I'm happy.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Oh -- you would!
A man might what?
You like music?
I'm waiting for him here.
Let's drink.
You are funny.
It's not funny at all.
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Oh -- careful Mr.
Here hold up!
You are late.
I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Of course -- of course.
Wait -- I must figure it up.
You'd want me to look nice?
I must go to England -- at once.
Well -- you want me?
Oh yes Mr.
I'll remember you Mr.
Oh -- too bad.
Is that Mrs.
Have you got it now?
Not too quickly.
With the same friend?
He was a lucky man -- that man.
-- That must have been nice -- for him.
You pay me.
Then you will please wait outside.
-- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
Let's go it's off.
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished.
You did it.
Then it's all over?
I know you did -- I said you did --
All you have to do is phone for it.
No water -- What a place!
Yes yes they do.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Shall I tell them again?
Nine-thirty Mr.
I'll ring.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Sold out for three days.
I've got to ask myself.
This is the end.
I will not wear them tonight.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Do you know the time?
Am I your manager?...
Have we a contract?
Or is that the time?
But when did he go?
He will be on the train.
We are dead -- it's finished.
There was -- there was.
What -- what is it?
Well now that's very kind -- thanks.
I can pay now if you like.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
Yes I know them --
Her room -- oh -- I see Mr.
Yes the police must be called.
-- We must do something...
Go away -- go away.
Believe me you have not.
You may go Mr.
I wish you a very good evening Mr.
Just one moment sir.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room?
If you will wait one moment sir.
Four minutes past.
I know these people.
How is the house?
We will wait.
Pretty as a picture.
What do you want with her?
I'd like to start something.
No one would have thought it of me.
From now on...
I'll see you in the morning then at the conference.
I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I know -- I know.
No news yet?
Have I kept you waiting?
Well you can tell them I said they're right.
You really think so?
A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
You're a thousand percent right!
Take a little leave a little.
And how are you making out these days?
Well that's nice.
You want a drink?
You'll never shit right again.
And if you do it wrong?
Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
It happened once.
It'll never happen again.
You expect me to buy this?
He left home a long time ago.
My son was in the hospital --
Now I'll ask you another.
Not as much as I should have been but there was a lot of action on those--
You're the guy I work for.
Right in front of the room.
I can park my car back there?
I'll put you in one thirty-one.
I know exactly what you mean.
Oh everything's the same size same price.
I'd like a single for tonight.
Please come out of it.
What would I do without you?
That's why you can walk on it!
Nothing behind it.
Come take a look.
Want a look?
So here we are!
If he could...
This has never been anything but --
Well of course not!
You brought a case?
Here you are!
We have to be ready.
Not much time.
Every once in a while a major change comes through.
Do you know what that means?
I certainly hope not.
My son will be all right.
Yes yes but that's --
You know who I work for.
Well make it stop!
Take two three days.
Call when you get there.
That's a thousand miles from here.
You are seeing it.
You're looking right at it.
Well I'd have to see it of course.
I have only one thing now.
Are you interested?
If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I'll get you a check.
Why of course it is.
But they must be!
It's something you almost never see.
But what's wrong?
That's what we'll do then.
Oh I'd like to stay on.
Just keep everything the way it was.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
I was just looking at --
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department.
But you need a man right now.
How soon will you be ready?
That's just the first year.
The idea is we'll top it by fifteen percent.
Sounds like a good Idea.
This place needs a sales manager.
So I heard.
But I still want to talk to you.
Knew it when I saw you out there.
What do I have to do to get it?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Keep me down.
The only future I've got.
If you try to do it your way what future is in it?
Oh that's it!
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money.
That's different.
I gave you your life twice.
I'm asking you to give me mine once.
But that's the way I am you know the way I've always been.
You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
A bad mother.
I've thought about it you know from your side since then.
I know just how bad I was.
Not very good!
You have no idea.
Yeah sure that sounds nice.
I know you do so that's why --
But so am I.
I thought you'd be happy for me.
After all you --
I thought it over and you were right.
Not any more.
It's a big world out there.
You must have some money.
You're not taking it.
You've already made a start.
And maybe it's a break for me after all.
I sat in there with her I thought what do I do now?
Stay and how do I explain?
That's pretty funny all right.
As though you do what I say.
That's what she was after though.
But why hit on me?
You still got time.
He'll spend the money to make sure.
Why should they?
I've really got to --
Take a minute tell me about it.
Somewhere else that's for sure.
Well that's good news.
You want me to drive up --?
Okay fine come on down.
After the meet.
That was the point.
For the hospital.
Is that enough?
I just give you your life.
What you do with it is up to you.
You do if you're where I am.
Where you want to be.
Nobody has to put up with that!
He let me live.
He let me be his friend.
You call that lucky?
That was my choice nothing to do with you.
I should have been on it.
Up to you.
And you have to be.
You're one to talk.
You do not!
I like those.
It's there.
So I've got a job.
What happened to your hand?
You always did.
What am I doing in here?
Just for a few weeks.
Sure I am.
What made you turn up after all these years?
So what's your story today?
I'll have it tonight.
For the money.
She's waiting.
Do you want a drink?
In your other hand.
Where's the five?
I am in school.
You're too young.
You should be in school.
I just left home.
Let me see how you did that one.
How do you like --
That's why you act so funny around each other.
By God it's your mother.
I'm happy the way I am.
I've seen people like you before baby.
What I say is no.
That's what I say.
Maybe I like it where I am.
It's there now.
The last I looked we were just talking things over.
And hello to you too.
Yes or no.
They're both easier at home.
This is time out.
But why not?
What a team we'll make.
I saw her.
You were gone for a while.
Oh come here.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night!
You looked so so...
Open it and find out.
Open your door.
You expect your father to come through?
I never needed them.
Join up with you!
I just bet you are too.
And when he got serious?
It was beautiful.
And getting better all the time.
I've heard the name.
The long end.
And a good one I think.
Same as me.
What you do for a living.
Working the what?
You already went back to work.
Great to get away take it easy.
Next week I'll get back to work.
You were right I had to get out of that hospital.
Nothing wrong with me any more.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
I'll see you when you get home.
Every day in every way.
Get well soon.
You're afraid of her.
Who else is paying for all this?
I want to know everything about you.
How long do they say I'm in here?
Your mother found you.
Hey what are you trying to do throw me off my game?
No more than this?
It this all we have?
Oh I am baby believe me.
Let's find out.
Always for you baby.
That's that.
That's that then.
No its -- Why did she--?
Yes I know I know.
Let's get it over.
You up to it now?
A hit you mean.
Thank you for telling me.
She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
I'm sorry it was her all right.
I know my mother nothing would make her check out.
I have a car here.
Happy to see you looking so good.
Well I'm back now.
I just wanted you to know.
We never know when and we never know why.
We never know how.
That's true Mr.
And thank them.
Why yes Mr.
The door was open so we let ourselves in.
What do you want me to do put out an A.
You know it's Michael.
Care to join me?
I'll be there in ten.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I like a woman who takes control.
Well when you put it that way.
Why am I here?
I think it would be best if you both left.
I'm very busy.
Mind if we sit down?
parents say he never came home last night.
Do you know who did this?
Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
A dead body?
We got a dead body in there.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
But they sure did a real number on your office.
And miss the big game?
Wait for the police.
I'm on my way to the ring and --
That would work.
Please get on the bus...
Just get on the bus.
She's not in her room...
Get on the bus.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Will sit down...
I'm sorry alright?
Just forget it...
I just went for a walk.
What the hell were you doing out there?!
I thought you'd never ask.
My life is a living hell.
What more do you want?
Alright I was wrong.
See we both agree.
So what difference does it make?
Well Dad thinks it's okay.
Okay you win.
Nothing's changed since yesterday or last week or last month...
the answer's still ""no.
You look kind of cold.
It's just hard to believe.
I'll come out.
Then you come out here.
I came to see you.
What are you doing here?!
Maybe she's in trouble.
Where'd you get it?
Okay tell you what...
Please let me keep the job...
it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'm very light of my feet.
finish up some things.
He's my brother.
There's something I have to tell you both.
What are you looking at?
Hey you alright?
I'm running out of advice.
Still wants to move out?
It's always John.
You seem a little off.
You're so easy...
Oh they're so stupid...
Better her than me.
I did alright.
What are you doing there?
Where's my mother?
What the hell happened this time?
He do that to you?
Then they can watch.
What if your parents come home?
We'd better go home and check on them.
There's nothing else for us to do here.
Whatever happened to women in back?
We got work to do.
No one's coming to get you.
Not while I'm around.
But just for tonight.
He says things.
But I've seen him!
They did, did they?
Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Remember our deal.
He's here!
I'm getting the children out of here.
John, I want you to come with us.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.
In our house.
A man came by the house.
What is it this time?
They were just kids.
I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Found this morning.
But I thought she was --
What makes you think he'll come here again?
His sister's room.
I've come to help your family.
The door was open.
Is everything all right in here?
Who's coming?
No, please listen!
They're coming...
coming for me and my baby.
No -- please listen!
It's not working!
Where's the baby?!
It was there when I found him this morning.
It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
All of you.
Now I'm afraid he could be next.
God, what's wrong with him?
Who am I supposed to be looking for?
You stay away from him!
What have you done to him?
Leave the boy.
I follow it.
There you go trying to make sense again.
Michael's mother had it, too.
It was you.
This is the way things have always been.
Where's the child?
I'll meet you over there.
No one's home.
An old friend.
Who was that boy?
You have to.
He's come home.
Or what's left of him.
I feel him.
I need your help to stop him.
After six years?
She came back, as I knew she would one day.
And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
It could have been anyone.
On the radio.
I've already made up my mind.
Just think it over.
And you're right.
'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
That's the whole idea of living in the country.
Christ, what a night!
No -- there had to be someone else.
Who else knew I had the baby?!
She's not the last night.
People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.
But I know.
I've always known.
What do you know about Michael?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
That's too much.
We were at war.
It could have been.
Everybody thinks that.
I know you think that.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You're so low!
Of course you'll go!
He's a man.
Tell him you're a man.
To our women.
Fourteen times you told me.
You told me.
You know me boy.
What's funny about that?
Could have happened to anybody.
Otherwise how are things?
Let's talk about something else.
And how were things?
You and I may not meet again for months!
You know what gets me?
It's been beautiful.
Let's talk about it some other time.
That's the point!
You're lucky boy.
You come home and nobody's here.
Tell them yourself!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Must have changed that law.
Home is important to a man.
I'm like this.
We'll see.
I hope the men do.
We've never met.
Miss me baby?
He can hold his ground!
Look after your things your things!
Oh--you silly people and your things.
Things things things.
Get used to it.
Back door Paul.
You actually sold insurance!
I forget mine for years on end.
You've come to the right man.
You talk to everybody just the same.
It's your house Dad.
Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Then speak by God!
It's man to man now.
Who was it?
You're free to go to her if you want.
If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women just say the word.
Still miss your mother?
I'm a man.
What'll I do?
Will you go to bed?
Tomorrow's Saturday.
Anyway she's dead.
You thank her for me.
Tomorrow's another day.
Yes wife it is.
Come here boy.
Your father is home.
No no no no no.
Oh no no no no no.
He seems to think they are.
He told me that were.
Remember that name.
I must ask the doctor why that is.
Should I stop?
Remember that name!
Tell me that!
Dad was never in England?
Name a country.
Were you in a war with Father?
You know what he called Father one time?
What's good about that?
And the doctor?
She met him at college.
Man and boy.
When did you know my father?
I'll see.
I should make a little list.
God yes I mind.
I'm your father's friend.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Are you--do you--
You were about to ask a question?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
As a matter of fact--
Then listen to me.
I mean it!
It's the American way.
Go get the police.
You hope this too?
Tell him to come here.
I plan to live one hundred years!
You hate your own life that much.
That's really what you want.
If he thinks he's man enough.
He's a child!
Give and take!
Beautiful you say?
Seven years gone--  like that like that!
Sounds quite beautiful.
Every living thing was our brother or our sister we thought.
"" Can you imagine?
What kind of a country has this become?
And where is the good doctor?
There's plenty of that.
Well--what have we here?
Two hundred years old.
Did you like it dear?
If he wants to go.
I came for Paul as well.
I came for my clothes.
And no one's there now?
They hate them in a way.
Well I can.
Maybe you're right about fish.
I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
That's the way God built you!
I want love.
That's what you're supposed to say.
I never heard that word but when I heard it I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
The way to get your wife back is in bed.
""Bring me a side order of Mrs.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs.
I have some change!
But now it's body time.
That's the idea-- that's my girl.
Now the small of the back.
It's body time.
Turn around turn around.
Now--turn around if you would.
I'm your husband.
There we go.
Go out and play.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.
Let's start right now.
You used to eat it up.
Do say hello to your mother.
Say hello to your mother.
He thought he could take my place.
Nothing would please me more.
You know what I want?
I want you both to be friends.
You should be friends.
I was I was.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
We thought a doctor might help.
What's that all about?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?
Half an hour?
I hope he can.
I'll be as quick as I can.
Give us time.
How do you do Mrs.
I'd heard you were beautiful and so you are.
It's a kind of man.
I live for a living.
What do you do for a living?
You are woman.
I know woman well.
What time do you get off work my child?
And what to drink?
Eighteen--  and a half.
Can I help you sir?
How do you do.
Somewhere in this city.
Not here not here.
Thank you--for my life.
Have it your way.
We'd both be better off dead now.
It's time it's time.
If you want to be found that way.
You'll like it there.
You can change!
Finish the job.
Was I ever of use?
And the hell with it.
Something is happening in there.
"" And the answer is ""Yes.
Cut me open.
No quarter asked.
No quarter given.
You realize that?
You're old--so old.
Oh dear dear dear dear.
What brought you back?
Is that the same thing?
This is man to man.
There's a certain amount of information there.
We have have we?
I've never heard of it.
Would you say that again?
I came back.
Oh--you came back.
That's how it goes.
I've got to run!
I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
You've got to get out right now!
And you come into Mrs.
I live across the hall.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
Will you please go?
And still Mrs.
You'll have to go.
I'll tell Mrs.
You can come back later.
I have to go to the hospital now.
You seemed at home here.
We'll miss you so.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.
Tell the hospital to expect her.
I'll leave right now.
When was that?...
Oh--hello Mother.
Such a final word.
He's dead you know.
We tried to be.
You know--maybe Mrs.
Well--I walked up to the front door.
My mother-in-law.
Who's dead?
For saying ""shit.
"" Or is that okay now?
No no--shit no.
So that's it!
You can leave now.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.
I'm only ten years old.
Thought you were another wife maybe.
That was very important to him.
I tried to be a good wife.
Any little kids.
Do I have to?
Who's the little girl?
I heard you were looking for me.
That goes double for me.
Explain it to them.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.
You bet I'll worry about it.
I said something wrong?
She's my date tonight.
Ask Paul what he thinks.
Your mother looks beautiful--right?
Then get him.
What does he say to do?
You know who this is?
That man is your father.
Father's friend.
Anywhere but here.
Where will you be?
I hate that thing.
I was afraid to ask.
How did she lose her feet?
You know she has no feet!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
That's an interesting piece of news.
A what kind of doctor?
Thank you kind sir.
You've already got a husband!
Stay home tonight!
Maybe he'll come back tonight!
It's his birthday.
And this is my son Paul.
He is my father.
A friend of your father?
Maybe it's supposed to end now.
It came yesterday.
This room is making everybody sick!
This is your family doctor speaking now.
It's fine!
You were wonderful.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
You're saying no.
You're a wonderful man.
You really are.
We were waiting for the right time to--
What's the matter now?
He said one other thing.
We've got to find him.
I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.
Before he started to run.
Did you talk to Paul?
It says ""Happy Birthday Somebody Else.
He started running and I started running then he lost me in the park.
Is he coming home?
Far as I know.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.
Shall we go?
It's been so long.
Women are always late.
That's something I suppose.
It's really that bad?
We met here earlier this evening.
I think that's what he'd do.
That's been said before.
""  On that we can build.
He's not your son.
Paul's only twelve years old.
And maybe Paul.
They're in there!
Or when I'm in there there's me in there.
Why would you do that?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
What kind of a life is that?
The only thing I ever told him about life was ""Keep out of the park after the sun goes down.
This is very good for us.
Tonight's the night.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask or what to say.
We made the date three months ago.
Take care of your body yes!
You think you're so funny.
You're not even funny.
Every week add a pound or two.
You can believe that if you want.
Speak for yourself.
I'm sick of this argument.
That's the only way you can have a country!
The late Mrs.
We're late!
Which we do.
But we can stop doing that.
Is that a fact?
You know what it says on the back?
Yes we do.
Have you been here before?
I'm sorry Mr.
I'm sure you're very good but at the moment I've got nothing for you.
If something comes up we'll give you a call.
What do you mean not the type?
Not the type!
I can come ten times a day.
I can keep it hard two hours at a time.
No just not the type.
You mean I'm black?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
Sometimes they turn up years later sometimes not.
There's something wrong here.
But is she has...
You help me I'll help you.
If he has anything to say about it yeah.
I heard you the first time.
doing your work for you?
I never seen her before.
about this woman.
I'm trying to find her.
Do you know her?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Whatever you want just say it.
I'm looking for a girl.
I need someone to help me.
Well actually I wanted to ask about this girl.
I have her picture here.
I have to ask you that.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
Well I want to...
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
I'll take a half hour.
I just want to ask some questions.
How many weeks?
She's out back.
She'll be free in half hour.
Man how many girls do you need?
That's all you got three girls?
My name is Hope.
What girls you got here?
You want some information?
I think it'll look better.
Are you sure it's all right?
He's a nice guy.
That was the word I was looking for.
I like it Mr.
What do you think of this...
But then you'll forget about me.
I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her.
You have to tell me where he is.
I have to find him again.
Where does he live?
Did you find out where she was?
' Yeah with my fucking money...
Kids think it's normal.
Did you have it good with your wife?
How'd you find that out?
She left you right?
I mean about her coming back.
Once a girl gets into the life.
On your own land?
They are the same.
After a while they all look the same.
You better do it my way.
Where does he live.
He's busy now.
It's not quite the same thing.
You really believe all that?
Then why be good?
More or less.
So it's already worked out.
I'm trying to figure this out.
No please go on.
I can stop if you want.
Be that as it may.
Yeah yeah go on.
Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
You have to believe in something.
What does he do?
They were here?
What do you care about?
But it's all you do.
A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money.
Then you're free.
doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
But does it make any difference?
How did you get to be the way you are?
Is that the way it was with you?
Okay tell me.
Why do you live like you do?
Now does that make me as good as you?
You never met a working girl before have you?
It's not good for you.
We'll find her in a couple days.
And your wife?
Where's she?
I'm her father.
You have anything to drink?
You want to go out and get something?
Let's just talk for a while.
When you get out we'll go.
When do we start?
Make it nine hundred.
That was my best week.
Half now half later.
How much do you make?
If we went there would you be able to find him?
Where's he?
Do you know where she would be?
You know her?
Got any parts?
I'm free.
Not free- free but you know free.
I'm making a film.
Did you see that picture?
She thinks so.
Three days work.
I finish tonight.
There's nothing you can do.
Forget this place.
But I'm here to help you...
Does she know anything about this?
I'll find out what I can.
It's just a name.
You know it's possible to buy anything on this earth.
How'd you hear about him?
I just heard.
Where'd you hear that name?
I'm sorry about that.
Have you found anything out?
You've got to tell me.
Like I am.
And in the middle of the morning too.
That girl could have told us something.
I hate it.
I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should.
They know less than you do.
But the police...
Next time it's sold it'll be called something else.
Who made it?
Where did you get that film?
I think there's something you'd better see.
You ever seen any of those?
I've got some news.
What have you found out?
This used to be a real city.
I was here about fifteen years ago.
What are you paying me for?
I've got a meeting...
Can you meet me in about an hour?
There's a number of ways I can go.
There's not much you can do here.
Stay if you want.
Maybe it'd be better if you went back home.
Ask around maybe she knew somebody out here.
Look I do this a lot.
Who's paying you?
It's full of them.
If I was you Mr.
Let me get the picture here.
The first of many.
So then Mr.
Well what do they know?
Tell them anything you want.
Tell them I needed a rest.
What will I tell the others?
They care about you.
Just do what I say.
Nobody's heard from you.
You should come around more often.
I've got to get over to the office.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
She would know.
Where does he hang out?
She's got a man.
A white guy.
Where is the girl?
Hey stop stop.
I'll do anything you want.
You can do anything you want to me.
I thought you were quite good in it.
I also like the girl in it.
Really thought she was good.
If she was still working.
I never saw it.
I remember that.
It was made by some college kids.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I've done a lot of good stuff.
But good stuff.
That's not true Jim.
In fact I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
That's not true Mr...?
He goes there.
You wait here.
I'll find out where she is.
She's with you.
Do I know you from somewhere?
With the money.
Then we'll go see the film.
You got the five hundred?
It's not me of course.
Who told you about this?
And that you had a film of a girl being ah you know...
A kind of chair?
What you got in mind?
I hear you got money to spend.
I hear you're interested in...
No take it.
I'm just trying to find...
No never saw her.
They're all about the same.
You want something?
It's a short film.
What we got is just these here.
What you see.
Sounds all right.
I'd just start my own business.
That's what I did.
That's big now.
Meet some people.
But the Lord's been good to me.
Big ones small ones.
But if I was you Mr...
what was your name again?
What exactly do you have in mind?
Well Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?
I've made a lot of money.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
I was told you were the man to come to.
I walked up.
You got a family?
I got a picture here.
I want you to tell me where to find this woman.
I been asking everybody.
What does that do?
Well a boy goes like this see.
You never heard of that?
I've been on another case.
I suppose I can move it over.
To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I'll tell you that was an interesting case.
In fact certain people for this girl and -- nothing.
He's got himself into some trouble.
I'm off that case.
Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Get a job?
You're taking a big chance.
The guy who bought you that ring.
I want you to take a look at this girl here.
And what was that other thing you tried?
Was he with a girl?
I heard he was around.
You remember me.
Well that's all right.
I've got a brother who's a real cut-up too.
Yes that's good planning.
He seems very nice.
I'm Mrs.
Officer I can explain.
Stand over here.
Must have been your brother.
None of that lady.
All right then and we'll be off.
Lady let me get this straight.
Well it's not really mine.
I just took it.
Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Although we do have a large business...
So you can imagine.
Well what is it exactly that you do?
And what do you do my dear?
What kind of a car is it?
Just sit down for a minute.
Now ask me what I see.
Tell me what do you see?
Sorry I'm late.
She has got to see a doctor right away.
Go - and love some more.
I'll never forget you.
""And this too shall pass away.
I've never said that to anyone in my life before.
You're the first.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
But why now?
It's part of life.
It's change.
Oh yes dear.
which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh you've thought of everything.
You are so young.
It was after the war...
I had nothing...
How different I was then - and yet how the same.
It looks like you.
I took them out.
Do you think there is any life up there?
They're old friends.
You sure have a way with people.
It was a new experience.
It had nothing on this afternoon.
She took my head.
Give me that.
Just like this.
You'll all end up like this.
I think we can come up with something.
But they have.
Well be kind.
I've never met her.
My mother set it up.
With this girl.
It sure has been a wonderful day.
And you - you are beautiful.
I'd feel stupid.
This is really nice.
It's so blue.
It's so big.
A lot of people enjoy being dead.
But they are not dead really.
The game goes on before them.
At any moment they can join in.
Take a chance!
But play as well as you can.
Go team go!
"" Give me an ""I.
You really want to hear about this?
I've died a few times.
When I look around me I know I know nothing.
Make good things happen.
Yes so do I.
But I think he is a little...
It's almost there.
And it is cold in here.
I suppose I did.
All around us.
It's the earth.
""The earth is my body.
""  Who said that?
Gets them every time.
He's stopped.
Ah the police.
Well here goes.
Everyone should be able to make some music.
Why it's life!
Let's play something together.
Oh Big Issues.
He was so serious.
A doctor at the University.
And in the government.
Oh it's all right.
He's never finished one yet.
What is that he's working on?
We'll come back in the morning.
Yes you're right.
It's in trouble.
Just one of those.
Is it enough?
It was my dear mother-in-law's part of a dinner set of fifty pieces.
I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday.
Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You look as if you could.
Try something new each day.
After all we're given life to find it out.
Certainly a new experience for me.
You try it.
Eh I like it.
That's really great.
It goes on and on.
It was my last.
"" Do you like it?
Do you think it's wrong?
Oh it's fine.
My door is always open.
Thank you but I really have to go.
It's very interesting.
I'm always looking for the new experience like this one.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
But this is my car.
Well it's a new experience for me.
Oh so do I.
It's all change.
Well then I must be off.
We shall have to meet again.
I have my car.
I heard he was eighty years old.
I'll be eighty next week.
Perhaps it is.
"" Listen to me...
That's wonderful...
What will people say?!
Where does she come from?
Where did you meet her?
To a girl.
I'm on the phone.
This one is particularly interesting.
Oh is this your father?
I had to give it up.
Do you play?
Perhaps you've heard of him.
My what a lovely place you have here.
What kind of stuff?
And my room and stuff.
What would you say?
How do you feel about that?
Then why did you leave?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Well maybe one.
None at all?
I asked do you have any friends?
What else do you like?
What kind of things do you do?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Well how do you spend your day?
But what else do you do with your time?
Do you go to school?
And a lot of time.
Does that worry you?
No I suppose not.
How do you feel about your mother?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I'd say fifteen.
Boy to think I could maybe make my own.
What's the chance of getting one of these?
I hope so sir.
Be able to tell your children.
Something for them to look up to.
You think so sir?
That's a great story
I thought I was done for.
Did we hold?
That's pretty strong stuff.
Hell, look at history.
War is not all black.
Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life.
Let's go off this way.
Well, thank you.
Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio.
Good afternoon, Officer.
How did you like that?
Then I suppose it was me.
Time to play.
We've always been here.
It's different for us.
Oh, I do.
All my family together again.
We're the same.
I knew you'd come back.
Here you stay.
And forward the only way to go.
I want to go back!
It's coming.
She certainly has.
She's done it.
Now get out of the way!
The things you were talking about.
I TOLD you.
In the House.
Like in your story?
Like in his house?
I need the box.
Hey, so for it.
I'm down.
God, I wish I could say no.
And you're sure it was a woman?
If anyone can help, HE can.
No, no-one can help.
No-one can.
But I have to save him.
Where's the other doctor?
He said He'd listen.
God, that's terrible.
What's the matter with her?
She's been here six months.
You a doctor, too?
It's been Hell.
You've come this far.
I've got to finish it.
What are you talking...
I have to go back.
Or it'll never stop.
You told me you'd always been in Hell.
You were wrong.
Look at it.
IT'S YOU.
And what about you?
But it's true, he is his own Hell.
Just as you are in yours.
I've come for my father!
Then why are you here?
I saw it...
But I got away.
And I took the box.
And they came.
Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
What the hell are you asking me for?
Oh, pardon me.
No, YOU talk to me.
We sent him home hours ago.
Who was here?
I never had any.
Is he serious??
I'm lucky that way.
Red I found something --
Behind this door.
Made 'em myself.
You're easy.
You mean outside...
I could be outside --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Something came through.
If he's here this is worse than I thought.
Oh I'll bet you have.
You'll need one of these.
May I have a word??
I hope you realize that.
I think that is its hand.
It was red.
That makes him more than a hundred --
Thought they were on our side...
Do you believe in hell?
It's almost over!!
I know where to find him.
I'll get him back.
And I'm not the only one.
She may never feel it.
Is it bad?
Be careful there --
I worry about you.
How hard can it be?
This time is different.
I'll get him soon enough --
And as a father I worry about him.
You're doing fine.
I'm in way over my head I know that much.
Did he now?
Do you remember what it said?
Where am I -- exactly Sir?
How does he know so much about me?
You're taking me for a walk!
Hey hey hey.
You have a first name??
I wanted to see her.
It's nobody's business.
Well you did break out --
I'll be around Red just back in the field.
Sir may I go first??
To ""fit in.
You saw the fish man right?
They're not speaking.
I can live with that.
Names hold the power and nature of things.
Mine for example.
You'd better stay here.
I'll find a way out.
We'll come back for you.
We go back!
-- should go back.
They never work.
Those things never work.
Set it walk away.
That's what you do.
That's why we need you.
Ah I see.
That makes it all alright then.
I knew those men better than you did --
But not everyone was so lucky.
How big can it be?
No matter what.
I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Are you sure about this?
Not from you.
Anything else you --
Where do you --
What was that??
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
You: think twice --
Well let's see -- there was that moment when I had a train on top of my head --
You want me to hold him down?
I never was.
Tape you up.
No no no it's fine: I do my job I take a break.
Tell Father I'll be home.
Where are you??
Father's back?
I -- I have these.
I like that...
And -- that's good.
It really is.
One: I'll always look this good.
What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
I've changed my mind.
Oh okay then.
Maybe later then.
Just a list -- It's not finished --
Is it long??
You better have that looked at.
You want to know -- Now --?
That you feel that way about me.
But it's not true is it?
Even now I feel he's here --
It's a beautiful name --
-- Section fifty-one.
Five minutes late.
Hello I'm --
My fucking hand!
Look do you want the bed in or not?
Where's my father?
Want to buy a bed?
It's my lucky day.
Her mother's dead.
Got her mother's looks.
Do you really need this bed lady?
Alright let's give it another try.
It'll go in.
You can keep them.
Just in time.
We want the man who did this --
I've seen him.
You did this before right?
No time for argument.
And you to us.
Now you must come with us.
You can have a telephone when we've talked.
Do you know who did this to you?
Please listen to me --
But first back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
Get back into bed.
Come to Daddy.
You want it?
One last time.
Give me the box.
I used to tell myself that.
Take it from me.
What CAN you do?
Or so help me --
Then we leave --
Maybe we should just leave --
There's very little I can do about it.
That's probably her now.
Or the police.
She'll tell them everything...
Then find me somebody else before they come looking.
I said no.
They'll never find us.
It gave me a little chance and I took it.
they left that here.
You would be.
You're still afraid.
Sometimes I think they're still here.
Just waiting to break out again.
In this room.
I'd done everything.
There was nothing left to experience.
It's not any box.
I want to know what happened to you.
Very much better.
I'd like something to wear.
Will you bring me some?
You'll stay with me.
Then we can be together the way we were before.
I have to get away from here.
Then we can be away from here before they come looking.
are beginning to work again.
I need more of the same.
What do you want me to do.
Just help will you?
Please God help me --
Back from where?
on the floor...
It brought me back.
It's really me.
Tell me who you are.
Sure you are.
I'm very happy.
But you said --
Well can I come in or not?
What was there to see?
I saw everything.
I was here this afternoon.
You look terrible.
I have to see my father.
Where's Daddy?
Will you drive?
Just to your left.
Which is where?
It's better you see for yourself --
Come with me then.
-- I'll go see.
Only I'll turn it off --
I've seen worse.
Just a moment.
I'll be down in a minute
Can I get you anything?
Just leave me be a while.
You're done worse.
I cut myself.
How are you doing through there?
We'll move in Sunday.
He's BEEN here.
There's stuff in the kitchen.
He's here?
I hear you.
So what's the argument?
You wanted to come back to London.
We came back.
You mean we're moving in?
She'll love it.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
We'll sell it.
The best part of ten years.
How long since you were here?
Just a thought --
It's ONE of these.
Too much drink.
You know you are.
You know you're very beautiful.
Maybe I will.
First time for everything.
Let's keep it that way shall we?
No not much.
Do you care?
Is this your place?
Let's go upstairs.
So what's your problem?
Let's get to it.
suppose so yes.
You know it's funny.
I feel like I've known you for years.
You want something to drink?
I suppose that's right.
There's a first time for everything.
You know it's not often I...
I try not to drink at lunch-time.
You like to keep a clear head eh?
I do it anyway.
No will-power.
Got a busy afternoon?
I wonder maybe...
Well if you change your mind.
What's this friend's name?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over.
Will you let him in?
Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I have to go find him.
Who brought me in here?
Wait a moment --
I'll get the doctor.
What happened to me?
I have to get out.
It's all over.
I want to see.
I'm afraid it's true.
He's better off dead.
And it's finished with now.
And he's --
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Try to make friends.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Maybe you should give it some time.
maybe we should never have come back.
Kitchen's through on your left.
I'll be nice.
I'll make myself some coffee.
Call me tomorrow.
Take care Dad.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days.
I want to do this on my own.
You know we can look after you.
Maybe later in the week.
First I've got to find myself a job.
Well come over will you?
See the place?
Well I want you to see the house.
Do you want me to come over?
YOU'D like my room.
You'd like the house.
I said: I found a room.
I found a room.
I got through.
He'll look after me --
they want to take me --
Thank God you came.
Are you busy after work?
No it's good to see you.
If I make it through the day.
Your father told me you were working here.
I've been better.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
It's not what I heard.
Yeah there's room.
There's plenty of room.
If there's a train.
I want to see you home.
Not that late.
It's late.
You know I do know the way home.
I'm coming!
I thought we'd lost you.
What chance would I have had against that?
None no chance.
She's Mrs.
Long time ago.
I was just thinking about her.
That's what we want.
We'll be ready.
That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What is she doing?
We're getting that anyway.
And we did.
And we are.
You even said they're good.
I heard you man.
"" That'd bring the house down.
Her dad died.
Just keep that out of my window.
So much for friends then.
Of course I'm not coming.
You're not even coming?
That's fucking great!
They were fucking called that before I was in it okay?
You two have to stick together now.
United in getting some.
How do you know about that?
Fine by me.
I never thought I would say this but can I go work now?
Why would they care?
But the word ""yet...
Just listen to me.
If I said to you --
What am I supposed to say?
And I'd feel sorry for you.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
You saw it twice.
come on, what would it mean to you?
What does ""yet"" mean anyway?
"" What does that mean?
""Let's Get It On?
What do you have to be happy about?
What do you mean, what?
It's not my car now is it?
We can take your car.
All three of us.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
But now I kind of like it.
What did he ever do to you?
Big fucking deal.
"" You think that Mr.
Oh so what's the point then?
Not the point.
Well what's the point in that?
We'll do it next Monday.
Yeah well it's fucking Monday afternoon.
You should get out of bed earlier.
But it's my new tape.
My Monday morning tape.
I made it last night just for today.
I have a television.
What about Television?
They always seemed what?
They always seemed really great is what they always seemed.
They always seemed...
I have all of the others.
What did I...
Why are you --
Can I have it then?
For her birthday.
""I Just Called To Say I Love You.
"" Do you have it?
He's not worth it!
You'd love it!
We work there!
He's got one!
You can be and are wrong.
""  But I could be wrong.
No not nothing.
It's the new --
It's on Friday.
Oh, you know...
""Music for Old People.
A friend who's a girl.
That's five.
Sure but is that it for the list?
I'll do one.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?
In a week or so?
What do you mean four more?
So four more.
Everybody'd go home.
Is there a difference?
In the club or at home?
I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Is now a good time?
You look just as old as you are.
You used to come to the club?
You must have only been about sixteen.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
I want to do a story on you.
It's all kind of lost in the...
More sure of himself?
You know what people are like at that age.
You can say what you like.
Do all men go through this?
yes at the moment.
Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?
You know how it gets.
What is this.
"" That's a nice one.
Can I do anything?
Yeah but more than that.
Here she's here and now!
I want a tape.
Let's not.
Do you want to...
talk about it that kind of thing?
It's just that --
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine obviously.
but you know good.
So I'll tell him before that.
Good news and bad news kind of thing.
I've ah...
got some other stuff to tell him anyway so it's no problem.
No problem at all.
I'll tell him next time I see him.
Well I'll just make it for you.
I'll tape it for you.
Let's get a drink.
Not a good idea.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Yeah I'm fine.
I'm off the phone.
I am fine...
So shall we leave it at that then?
But you know...
We want to make things easier for you.
I'd hate it if I lost her.
Do you see what I'm saying?
Yeah well I've stopped all that now.
These people are ready for anything.
I should have played the record first.
Well you've asked.
It was the asking that was the important thing.
I mean maybe you're right.
I'm only trying to explain.
I want to think about something else.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
What brought all this on?
Not in love exactly but...
We took care of that.
They'll go on early.
You had no right.
It might even be why I came back.
Just local of course.
Yeah and he said it's a good way to break out a record.
You knew all along I'd like them.
But you've never met.
Paul and I.
Paul from work.
Otherwise what's the use?
You're being stupid.
Yeah you're alright.
But you're certainly not happy.
So what happens if you get happy?
I still do after work.
Should we just break up?
Is that what you're saying?
How were we the same people?
When I met you we were the same people and now we're not and...
Money does not matter.
I'll pay for you.
I need to.
Hey great idea.
Or New York even.
And that is my last word on the subject okay?
To make you feel better.
Just say something.
It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
But the nice time we just had...
Look we're okay now.
We just had a nice time.
Let's leave it at that.
You know the difference.
What else could it be like?
What it was like.
Want to know what exactly?
Let's go home.
And we know each other and we care for each other and you've made it clear that you want me back so...
Everything's too hard.
I lived with you.
Look we can do other things.
was that all you used?
There's nothing to worry about.
It's not...
I've only got a couple left.
I want to feel something else than this.
It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.
Sure I understand.
You get back and I'll wait here for a bus.
I can see why you say that.
Look I'm sorry.
The last thing I wanted was...
I just wanted you to know that's all.
I'll see you on Friday.
She knows where to go and everything...
I've got too much to do.
Look are you coming or not?
Do you want me to be there?
It's like...
When I get it together.
My dad died.
My dad my dad.
Just get into bed.
Worry about that when you're better.
God that's a cold and a half.
Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Well think about it.
I'm sorry to go on about it.
They're not really though are they?
that was a present for me.
But the rest of this stuff...
Sure they are.
You know I'm a good person.
I hate him too.
I'm sorry but can we get this straight?
What do you call him?
I mean how much are you making now?
It'll make you feel better.
That bad eh?
You still together?
It was kind of funny.
He's at home.
He had no right to do that and I told him so.
Those look heavy.
I might have missed some stuff.
Is that the last of it?
I called and called but you were out.
I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
I mean I think about it...
Think about what I said.
I do not know.
I'll talk to you later.
Are you still in love with me?
I'm not -- hold on...
You're running.
On the run.
Call me at work.
I know what you're like.
I work too you know.
We can meet for another drink if you want.
So I can explain it better.
And anyway I keep trying to tell you that's not really the point is it?
You must have known it would happen.
Like you said I've been living with the guy.
"" ""I Want You?
"" ""I Hope You're Happy Now?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
So, how are you?
We'll talk some other time.
I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
I'll look for 'em.
Have you seen them around?
Will you please just go?
I was living with you, remember?
But I'll tell you one thing.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Is what better?
Better than what?
Is it better?
Just ask it!
It sounds stupid.
If I can ask one question.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
It means he might live.
There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Maybe I'll never see either of you again.
All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I am not living with him.
Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.
Your living with the guy!
Did you say something?
What were the others?
It's one of the things I thought of.
That your not big enough a deal for me?
Is it my job?
This is really hard, you know.
I think you know that.
And do you like it that way?
You really believe that?
that's me.
That's all there is to me.
If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
More so then than I am now.
I'd like a word with him.
""Got to Give It Up!
-- Alright alright but --
Well I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Are you coming home?
I should be so lucky.
He goes on long enough.
Well stay for tonight then.
We've done the hard part now.
I might as well you know...
But is this really the time?
And maybe you think I should but it's not much of a life you know?
Enough of what?
It's true!
You let me believe that!
Actually I'm fine.
Last night I got to thinking ""you know what?
Maybe it is time to move on.
Maybe we're just not right for each other.
Or maybe we are.
It made me feel like...
You called this morning?
And so it is.
God you ask a lot of questions.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?
Or would you like them on?
So you'll stay?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
I'd better go.
Go over to my parents'.
Yeah but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
I understand completely.
God I hate that time.
That pick up stuff time.
I just went through that before I came here.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff.
No big thing.
Everything go alright?
No no I love it's just thinking you're you must be so sick of it...
Not far from here actually.
You meet someone you move in she goes.
She is not that kind of girl!
That's not what happens now.
I'd like to hear her side of it.
Do you know why she left?
Meet a nice girl and have children.
Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this would happen.
She just called.
Well call her mother.
Not say where gone.
Where did she go?
Up and down.
Everything all right?
It's your mother.
But that's it.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
With eleven hundred he could come home and that's the last thing I want.
What about fifteen-hundred?
They're worth five times that.
There are plenty of others who will.
Can I pay you properly?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Can you make sure you give me a five?
I must have nothing.
Their my husband's.
But you must have --
I know what they're worth.
Give me fifty and get them out.
I'll take care of the rest.
I'll put out your record.
It's simple.
Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
I think you have more.
Those are for us.
He'd want to know about all this.
Find the father.
That should clear things up.
How old is Richard?
The father looked just like Richard.
You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
It's my birthday.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Would you remember his name?
Asked a lot of questions.
Never even saw her son.
He died a few days after he was born.
Suppose nobody does.
I did it right here at the house.
No thank you I'm fine.
Would you like more tea?
It will be horrible.
Nothing but a moment.
I'm the last.
Will I see you again?
All of it finished.
It's all the same.
But you're known so much.
History I'll only read about.
What is it like?
Not the same.
There is something more.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.
He is older than I.
He knows about you.
It goes on.
I'd like you to try.
That would be difficult to explain.
But you're different.
It's in your hands.
I'm not even sure why.
It's you.
I hope I never get that old.
You're using your son's name.
Here try this.
I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
Maybe it would do us both good.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
They do it each year.
We just wait?
There was a man once.
More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.
Today is the same as the first.
Tomorrow will be the same as today.
So much time.
You love history?
You as Mrs.
You want me to front for you.
But that's where you come in.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr.
When you finish what then?
Not all of them.
What's all that?
I had to talk to you.
No one knows you're here?
I'd rather hear yours.
I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
Have you gone to the police?
I've been at this a very long time.
What will you do now?
At the moment?
I have friends.
I think you do.
And I think Mr.
-All but one out of a hundred I know.
Now if you will please-
Call your mother.
You never call her.
What's all of this got to do with me?
What makes you so sure he's the one?
knows all about that.
It'll never stick.
But there's more.
We've got nothing to say.
You and I should talk first.
That's my right.
My job the people I get involved with I'm up to here with it.
Too bad no one else did.
Good way to lose your job.
It's that important?
All I need is for you to check the name.
Someone should check him out.
He has one he might have two.
I think he's got something to do with it.
What are you doing man?
I'll be back when I can.
I have my friend to keep me company.
That is not me.
You do not know what time can do.
You must be.
Do not become one of them.
I am not ready for this.
Some like you and he have more.
But why be so concerned about me?
But you will learn.
And you will be good I can feel that.
This is why our friend is so concerned.
In this I can help.
How can I stop such a man?
Then it is over.
It is always less with my living.
Far or near.
There is power in this.
Oh my God I'm lost.
Then they were right.
You will live.
What is to become of me?
You are not dead boy.
Hear the words.
It is as you are.
I'm twenty-two.
You are still so very young.
You know this you can feel it.
He told me there could be only one.
You feel you know me.
It is less.
Does it change with me in the room?
You are the same?
And like you I paid the price for being different.
You know me home.
It still has life in it.
Back home the food is so...
What is it you call this?
First food no?
How can you know this?
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
And but for a mark you are well as any man no?
I did at that.
But you lived.
Please go to no trouble.
And I would like a moment of your time.
You're not from these parts.
Do what you must.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.
But not from you.
Me father has taken back my hand.
Some think not.
But I did live.
No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
I'm standing here as real as you.
I have no future husband.
I'm your future husband remember?
Where did you ever learn it?
What would you like?
I am your only real friend you know.
I look forward to the day we meet again.
It's all we have.
Certainly not me.
It will probably be your last.
We need more time.
They're nothing but boys.
You see Major?
You are not so different...
Either you are with me or against me.
Do not turn your back on me.
Who do you think I am?
Look at your life Major.
Look at mine.
It's what we live for.
Stay out of it.
We must talk.
It never changes Major.
It can be different.
I've seen others ""help"".
Then it is time two of us did.
You are very young.
I was once young.
I think we understand each other.
I am a Major Private.
You seem to understand a great deal.
What is your position?
All of ours.
Must he go?
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Yes he was.
Where did you learn that?
They like their food where they're used to it.
I want this to be all ours.
out there first?
Looks good though.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Should have seen him the first night.
Any other I.
Figure she's with him?
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
He knows I'm here.
He got him.
He always does.
The last four.
How many came?
What name is he using?
How do you live so full of life for so long?
-Since you last saw me.
He always did.
He found us even there.
Good times then.
Not like now.
Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
What's the point!
You have me finish it!
Leave her out of this.
You've been here from the start.
Not so long.
Should I care?
I want you to come to me.
Are you here?
I've got all the time in the world.
All I need is time.
Where were you Tuesday night?
For the moment.
That's none of your business.
What are you getting at?
He'd also been in the country less than a week.
Your men came right after.
No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Nothing to be sorry about.
I'm sure that's true.
Such a pretty day.
I'll send them right up.
We were very close.
Sure take after him.
Oh yes more than enough.
Open this door!
Are you back?
I'll keep you in mind.
Let him have everything he wants.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
How would you like to work for me?
I should say not!
And you can meet us at the station.
You got it back eh?
I got it back.
Then suppose you give me the money.
Did you give her the money?
Where's mother?
Out some place.
Oh she was here.
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
How'd you get out?
Yes he is...
How could you ever think of such a thing?
That's right here.
I've done it.
I'll be careful darling.
You be please.
One -- two -- three -- four -- five.
On second thought would you let me have it?
The five hundred?
Have you got that money?
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
It's strong.
But I like it that way.
Oh he's not the man for you.
But I sort of like him.
Mother is coming with us on the train.
I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I heard it but I just wanted to hear it again.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Say I want to be sure too!
I just wanted to be sure.
Take a look will you?
That's the kind of stuff they want!
What does she look like?
She may be lost.
Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours?
She's only a woman after all.
She was supposed to come down and get you.
We're busy!
what's that?
I should thank you.
Well thanks for everything.
Well I got to get back.
Oh wait a minute.
Well she'll know some day.
For me -- it'll never be over.
I'm beginning to realize that.
I love her too.
Well of course if you put it that way.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years.
Well you'll take care of her.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
I've got nobody else to leave it to.
This makes me feel funny.
If it would save a man's life.
Another hour to write it.
All you've got to do is talk to him.
Anything the matter?
Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Yes I know...
That'll be nice.
A home with mother.
Just for the first year.
Well I'll try to give her one.
But your mother --
-- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh I thought there was something funny...
Then who are you?
I've just told you I was busy with Mr.
Get out of here you!
Come over to my office will you?
I never saw this woman before in my life!
You will eh?
Well we'll see about that.
All right boys.
I'll show you what I'm doing.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Oh you did!
Well that's very very interesting.
Close that door.
You'll ask me to what?
Otherwise I'll have to ask you to get out.
He's talking like a child.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
That's what I am.
Sure I can.
Look at the policy I gave him!
That's what he said the last time.
Well I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Well if she looked like you -- Say!
I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Well maybe I'd like to know just once!
But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are.
Sure it was good -- it was wonderful!
We're a different world.
Look at what we went through today.
We tried it.
The paper -- and being Mrs.
Is that job still open?
Then why are you doing it?
I'm not doing it for you!
Well -- what is it?
I suppose I could.
Well if it's my last story I'd like it to be a good one.
I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
That's how we happened to --
I mean -- working together.
Just like the old days.
In a way.
You'll each get about ten years I think.
Which ought to be about three hours more I'd say.
Who did you talk to?
Let go there!
Will you come here?
See if we can move it.
Ring that number will you?
Shut up will you?
All right -- put her on.
I'll talk to her...
Was there an old lady --?
Is this the Community Hospital?
You got who?
Listen it's a matter of life and death!
If it was my own mother I'd carry on!
You know I would.
For the paper!
what can I do now?
How can I ever face him?
Oh I hope he never comes back!
What'll I tell him?
What will be will be.
What did you do with her?
After this story?
I'm finished.
Of course he's coming back here.
Is he coming back here?
Call him a love-child if you want to.
Where's some paper?
All the words you've got.
How much do you want on it?
They'll see him.
Where's our phone?
That's all you are.
I'd like to think.
Do you realize what you've done?
What do you mean you're getting out!
There's your story!
I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Where is he I said.
Hold on a minute.
I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I'm not good enough to make this one up.
Well I'm coming to it.
What's the story?!
You'll get it.
Now what's the story?
I'll have the paper send the money right down to you.
Never mind it?
That's not my money!
No thanks I've still got those.
You keep out of this.
You phone me as soon as Mr.
Now you're talking!
Maybe you'll be.
We're not interested.
What do you mean only an act?
You see what I had to put up with?
It needs a woman's heart --
You said it.
But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Well I'll tell you one thing old man she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
How do you like that?
Now you got me.
Then what does he want with you?
Is he as good as you say?
You're not afraid are you?
Say could I meet him?
as quick as that?
He wants a home -- and children.
He does does he?
Well I can and I love it!
Oh sure it's honest.
The insurance business?
He's in the insurance business.
What's his line?
Makes about five thousand a year.
Where'd you meet this man?
I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
I'm through.
Look at this!
I'm not working for any other paper!
Will you just --
Do it for the paper.
That's what I'm afraid of.
""Any time -- any place -- anywhere!
There's nobody else on the paper who can write!
Might just as well be.
Not today of all days!
Well I suppose so...
If you have to you have to.
But not you!
Well the paper'll have to learn to do without me.
And so will you.
You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
What were you when you came here five years ago?
Well go on and take it.
Work for somebody else!
That's the first time you've been right today.
That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Just what I said.
Sure you can.
I have a lunch date.
I just want --
Sure come on.
We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Well suppose we did?
Now that's a nice thing to say.
I suppose that's true in a way.
We've got something between us nothing can change.
I'll always remember it.
""-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!
Oh yes I would.
I'd know you any time --
Maybe it was yesterday.
Seems like yesterday to me.
You know what.
How long since we've seen each other?
How long is what?
You know you did!
What's that -- what's that?
I always have both.
You got plenty of money?
You know me.
Get 'em off the street -- anywhere.
Who do you want?
You stay here.
I'll find out everything.
You know what I mean?
Now everything's fine.
He's on my phone.
He just called me.
First we talk.
Let's see the money.
It's a deal.
Let me up.
Is it a deal?
A lot of money.
It means my job!
How about a little service?
What are you doing around here?
Yes I suppose so.
That might be all right.
But not actually.
It's easy for you to talk.
We're still working.
Give me a hand with her will you?
I've been trying to get her to come to.
All right -- all right!
Open up there will you!
What you got?
I'll have it in a minute.
Hold the phone!
Come on you!
We better hold onto 'em both.
So have we!
Call you back.
No I tell you!
Nobody knows where he got it.
Boy did you see her go?
What's the use?
What did he ever do for his country?
We know what you're up to.
Now where is he?
Is that any good?
I'll call.
And you sir?
Take hold of the cover.
Take her along.
I got ways of making her talk.
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you.
Hang onto her!
Keep her in here!
Let me go!
Hold her boys!
What's the idea?
You ought to stay over.
Oh nothing much.
Now wait a minute!
I'm not afraid of anything.
Same way you did.
Where he used to live.
After all I've done for you --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Four of Mr.
What went off?
Just one second --
Well wait a minute will you?
I'm in conference.
You want me?
And now Mr.
And so do I!
Nothing personal in it.
I never saw him before!
Who is this man?
There must be somebody there!
Yes I'll be right out there.
Well I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now do as I tell you.
Just -- one -- second!
Now what do you say?
They got him!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
What'll we tell 'em?
Two days ago!
But they've got nothing to do with this case!
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
If there was any way out...
What do you mean -- through?
If you're talking about my brother- in-law he's worked for the city fifteen years.
I'll see you after.
He ought to be here any minute.
Well all right.
You'll take fifty and like it!
And they found the watch on him.
You keep away from me!
-- You were with her.
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you!
Where's the old lady?
I'll go right after it.
Give me that!
Oh some insurance man.
Are you in?
I'll take it.
Oh did you hear that Central?
Yes she's still here.
Oh I can give it up all right.
I've got some news for you...
Look out you --
What's the matter with you boys?
If you want to go I'll cover this end.
I thought so too.
I thought you were gone.
I made it up just now and who's asking you?
Yes right now.
You know it is!
It'll be for life!
So long nothing!
I got it -- right here.
One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty.
Come on with that money!
That man there!
I never said any such thing.
Mother I can explain everything.
I'll go with you in five minutes and --
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
What good'll it do?
Let 'em take me.
Well maybe you think I could!
Only -- you're getting too near.
No no you're right.
Yes -- that's right.
I'm your friend remember?
She's a wonderful person.
It's the only answer.
"" Well maybe that's the answer.
They're very simple.
Are you all right now?
Shut up you!
Just play dead.
I'll be right here.
They'll get him!
We've got to do something!
Where are they gone?
You know where they are?
The Lord made them that way.
This is no place for you.
She's good enough for me!
And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
A very fine-looking women.
Here's the picture of my wife.
It's easy -- it's very easy!
Is it hard?
I'll explain it tomorrow!
All right Mr.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow.
But how do I know...?
But you could bring 'em in here!
You see I've got my family in the country.
You mean here in the city?
Who do you think!
How much do you make a week?
Yes I did just now.
How do you like that.
They were all standing around when he wrote it.
We want to see you.
Yeah hold the line.
Hey this looks good.
Well - we've looked every other place.
Want to go out on it?
It's a simple story.
If you ask us no.
She'll be back in a second.
Well if you'll hang on a minute she ought to be right in.
That is all.
Now shut up or walk.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Give him the you-know-what.
It's my turn.
Can I try?
So it was.
This boy will go far.
I remember her from last year.
You're in.
Now put them together.
That word is special.
That word is only for something really important.
I only know one.
Well go on then.
They're not.
Yes you was.
Make him talk.
That's what they do when they know how.
You do it.
You're a girl.
Ask her yourself.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Well for the baby really.
Well I'm not having any.
It's not the same.
They've got the real thing outside.
Not on us.
and four and five...
The next one is ours.
It's dinner time.
I did see them.
You said that last year Dad.
When someone else does you want to find them out.
Always remember that son.
I can hear it.
But Dad It's the News.
They send over a few every day to let them know we're still here.
No thank you!
Here's your Christmas present.
You do you do.
You're just not saying.
Take it away.
I know your husband's been away a long time but....
They might be.
It was great for me how was it for you.
Here's to music.
I will if you will!
Keep your head!
There is all right.
Is there any point to it?
Never done better.
Like everyone else.
We've been had.
You thought you did.
Look at your street.
Made my hair stand on end.
What did we know?
We were seventeen.
I love them like my own.
the thought of it before it takes hold.
What's left of him.
The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I've had a letter from her.
They've moved house.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I was too old when it finished.
I wish you could have told me yourself.
They say it'll be over by Christmas.
And it was the last.
Not even a birthday card.
We all had to write a last letter home.
They'd gone.
It's coming on its own.
It's happening to me.
I told him that.
He said I was right.
I was terrible to him.
Who said anything about love?
You better bring him home if you really love him.
There there my baby.
I want him so much.
I'm fifteen.
I'm still at school.
I'm different from you.
The ideas you get in your head.
He always knows.
You know it?
It must be an old one.
Oh you girls.
Up to six weeks I think.
It's War!
I wish it could all have been different.
You might still have a house.
What would I have done without you?
We did all the proper things and we lost love.
Not even the war can do that.
He kept asking and asking.
And you never did.
That is a terrible thing to do to someone.
Always held something back.
Let them go if they want.
How many of our class left?
You and me out of twenty-eight.
It was the best time of his life.
Never mind you can stay with us.
Father that's enough now
Happy as can be.
Here we are all together again.
Maybe I am.
And not often ever.
I like it on my own.
On your own.
I know you mean well.
Why does it always come out wrong?
You're thinking of yourself.
It's so far way.
It's not fair on them.
Oh I know.
I hate that word...
Maybe maybe maybe...
hey you know what word I hate?
I used to play there all the time.
Yeah I know where that is it's right by my house.

Hot has got nothing to do with it.
She was pretty hot.
As far a hot...

There's nothing else.

How much is a person supposed to stand?
Just sit back and enjoy the show.

Now I'll be up all night...
No please let me sit this one out.
Yep I found something.
Yep I suppose it is.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Shit I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.

What about the body you found?
We found one.
You and Mr.
Anyway there's not much else out that way...
That must be him.
We found 'em.
How old do you think I am?
Get to your point.
And think about what you've done.
"" Go to your room now.
Tell the boy again.
I'm just trying to help.
It's hair.
It's not so bad.
I'll be out in a minute!
I need to get ready for my date.
No it is never terrible to be in love.
You are all that too.
But you have something more.
Like father like son.
Say my name.
Did you bring any clothes?
Hello my little boy.
Please let me go with you.
That is horrible.
And that's great.
But it would be great in a better way not a better way but a different way if I could find him and bring him back.
We still have you and I.
I worked so hard.
We worked so hard you and I.
I want our boy back.
Yes please somebody ask him what is wrong.
And you were wonderful too!
You were wonderful!
Did you know that?!
I've moved on.
Come already to the point.
You look so beautiful.
God you're beautiful.
You heard me!
Go away from here!
You think too much.
is what I need!
Well I think...
Well I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
I've got some things to tell you.
Now I hate you!
Just one minute of your time.
We have nothing to say!
I just want to talk.
Take me darling!
You were wonderful today darling.
It made me so hot for you.
It is now that you must decide.
but I will not wait.
It is like that.
Only it is this.
Not in front of the boy.
I thought that's exactly what you did.
What are you supposed to do?
Be home around seven.
One moment please.
Nothing, my darling.
All is right with the world.
What is wrong, my darling?
Thank you so much.
You're a very pretty girl.
You should know that.
Life is funny, that's all.
It's nice, yes.
Maybe we should just sit for a while.
Shall we close up, then?
That would be good.
I should turn them off.
He seems fine.
The lights and all.
And how is our son?
Is everything fine?
Perhaps I called at a bad time.
I came to think.
God, Did I hang up on you?
I did not know.
I like it when you say my name.
Is that stupid?
Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man...
but I'm talking too much again, no?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
I should not have asked such a stupid question.
I know you are a very important man and...
I'm actually on my way to...
would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.
Is that okay?
Today is your day.
If you think it will help.
For both of us.
I want you to go back to your old life.
We'll never talk about it again.
We'll never talk again period.
This is the end of the road.
Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none.
There is no other reason.
I want to be the way I was before.
But it's okay.
I like you so much, with or without hair.
Bad for business.
Shut up, you.
If you will.
Let's get you out of here.
How'd you know where I was?
My brother told me.
Three foot one.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
That's what made it cheap.
One night stand?
I had that once with a guy.
God he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Shut up and tell me.
My brother knows him.
You still in the market for a real boy?
I'm getting to be a real girl.
You can stay.
I gave you...
Look at you two.
You're the best.
Yeah well I'm sorry.
I gave up my body hair!
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
But that's what the hell I did.
So he's doing okay?
You were gone a long time.
How's the book?
Should I come with?
Thank you very much for that.
You just have to control it.
I think he's ready.
That was wonderful!
At the time though I thought it might help.
Such as my man and how to please him!
Such as looking pretty for my man!
And I want to help.
Oh yes baby!
I could come work for you!
How's work?
I'll make it.
I know what you drink.
You remember that from my book?
A real girl!
You're exactly what I want.
I'm trying you know.
I'm trying to be what you want.
All I want is to be what you want.
Do you like my new look?
And you work late every night.
I just have to know.
I really need this.
You've been working late a lot.
You know about stuff?
Was that okay?
I mean was I able to...
I have to think!
I'm I'm...
It's working but it takes time.
Who from work?
Someone from work!
Be right out.
He's happy here.
If it's a person why should we go see it?
It's not like it's nature or anything.
It's just a person.
Might've been a person.
That's very funny.
We are ready!
Think of all the time one would save.
It'll be wonderful!
That's a great idea.
Oh do you darling?
I simply love the...
I'm sorry about my parents.
I'll be out in a minute.
Actually Mother and Father you look very very old.
Like what for example?
You really enjoy my company?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Boy this is good!
You look wonderful.
It looks wonderful.
It's important work.
Quite well really.
It's a lot of work.
My work now is...
I love that you said that.
I've been seeing someone.
Believe me I've tried.
One would like to move along.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Whatever you'd call it.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
As do I.
I have to talk.
I'll just go on my way.
You'll never see me again.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Oh I will!
It's wonderful!
Do you think I'm ready?
Free to come and go as you please.
I tried so hard!
Oh I'm so happy!
I understand the problem.
That's fair.
I mean she's a wonderful person.
And she's a good person.
Yes that's something to think about.
That's very good.
It's good to see you again though.
I've been looking for you for thirty years.
It's open...
You look different...
Hey another one for me and another one for the lady.
Hey he's right!
Late afternoon is better.
You have to win them all.
All I want's the money.
As if you'd just taken his money and now all you want is...
That's the way it's done.
Put it on the bed.
In a little while.
Are you ready for another?
I'll make it up to you.
You're a horse that finished last.
Live and let live.
While you can.
Well nobody has to sell.
No there's no tomorrow.
Not with you.
Today for me tomorrow for himself.
For what makes the world go round.
You know what's good for him?
Yeah I think we do.
We could try to cut each other up.
But that would be bad for everybody.
Bad for me bad for you.
Do we need words?
And a fact is a fact.
I'm sure Mr.
How's the hands?
Been there myself.
What makes you know so much?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Lots of action.
Lots of money.
Lots of class.
The night is young.
I asked him will he?
Oh about five hundred.
Oh we'll start small...
Just win win you said win that's the important thing.
Boy we really gave it to her good.
It can be thirty...
Well here it's half.
Tell her what?
You want me to tell her for you?
It's a long walk.
I'll play him with my own money.
How're the hands?
How do we stand?
Let me play him.
She had a little too much to drink that's all.
Well I win sometimes.
He'll be over here.
Over there by the bar.
Come on let's go...
Play it again.
You were through.
You saw him you saw how he looked.
You know what you were doing?
In my head I played it a thousand times.
Here I got it.
Never saw him play.
They say he's one of the best.
How good is he?
Thinking about what?
I been thinking.
Like I told ya.
What happened to you anyway?
You seem to do all right that way.
Something wrong with your hand?
How's business?
There are places.
Seventy-five twenty-five.
Yeah you already told me that.
But I like action.
That's one thing I think you're good for is action.
Why back me then?
Why not back yourself?
That's how you find out who's best.
That's the only way.
I never saw you do anything else.
You think I can lose?
How much you think you're worth these days?
And also there's something in it for me.
Get the three thousand.
To do what?
Maybe I can help you.
Thanks for the drink.
That can be heavy on your back too.
But you let him off.
Well that's mine.
I like that car.
I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
When nobody knows that much?
So I stay.
What do I do go home?
You bet he knows how.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
It's good for you.
Only when I work.
Make it twenty.
Would you mind moving?
Just stay where you are.
He'll find you.
Just tell me where I can find him friend.
Want some free advice?
Yeah that's right.
The expensive kind.
What's your game?
You want to play?
Just like that.
Just like that?
That's what I want.
Yeah that's what I think.
What's the difference where?
Is it all right if I have another drink?
He thinks I care about the money.
I care about you.
We're together a long time night and day.
Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road?
I'll tell you what -- take her along.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Never been out of it.
Is that what's on your mind?
I'll get you your money back.
What kind of life have you got here?
I've had that kind of life.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Yeah yeah like a son.
I've known this boy since he was sixteen.
You walked out on me like that.
He was like a...
So am I...
How do you want me to play it?
I asked around.
I looked all over for you.
If that's all you got that's all we got left.
Is this all we got left?
It's mine.
Go on home.
Just leave me the money.
Well maybe that's it.
Will you shut up...
Just give me a drink.
Give me a drink will ya?
I mean you've never been able to see it.
I came after him.
Get with what?
You wanted ten thousand?
You got ten thousand.
You're coming with me.
How much we got?
Yeah like a church.
Set 'em up.
You're into me now.
I got my money on the table.
Let's get back on the road.
Set 'em up again...
Set 'em up the way they were before.
It always does.
Hey give us another round will ya?
One for him one for yourself.
You must come again.
Oh yeah yeah.
I'd show you to the door but I...
Yeah sure has.
For who Mr.
Oh no nothing for me.
My house my game.
No none for me.
Come on let's play.
Would you like to come out tonight?
I'll bet you do Mr.
I'll just bet you do.
A little although I'm afraid I generally lose.
Why do you?
And I you.
I think I've heard about you Mr.
No no more for me.
You better not miss friend.
Two on the five five on the nine?
Just you and me.
Yeah I'll play you a couple.
Once and for all will you get out will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
That man this place the people.
Well what's the matter?
Here you hold it.
I'll be up later.
I made you up like everything else.
He walked out on us when I was seven.
The men I've known...
I wanted you to be real.
Well what's your idea of love?
I'd know.
I got no idea of love.
Just sit here and wait?
When you feel like coming back you'll come back.
And you'll love me.
And then you'll go away again.
Is that your idea of love?
Even when I thought I was.
You know it.
Now I need the action and I need the money.
I told you I'd be back.
With a friend.
Try to make some money.
I need it the money.
Yes I want to know what for.
Come on now.
No I want to walk.
More like a week.
Look I'll be back.
What do you want to tell me?
Want another drink?
I never saw you wear one before.
Well what's so funny?
I feel pretty.
You look very pretty.
Yes I need them very much.
And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
You need the words?
Some men never get to feel that way about anything.
Why'd I do it?
You know like anything can be great -- anything can be great...
If a guy knows.
If he knows what he's doing and why and if he can make it come off.
You just know.
And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Does it bother you?
What he said?
Well what else does?
Why did he tell you?
Would he know?
He said I was.
What's it so hot in here for?
You can read it if you want to.
You want to go out for a while?
And I'm sure you'll help me.
Will you say that to me too?
Give it back to me.
What's this supposed to mean?
Oh it's a story.
A story I'm making up.
What are you writing?
For a little while.
No stick around.
Where do you get the money?
To pay for all this?
No why should I?
It's yours.
Oh it's not bad.
I've got something in my bag.
How do you like them?
When you've got money you'll pay.
What did all this stuff cost you?
Take your choice.
You got it all in your head?
See that book?
I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here.
Did you read all them books?
You want to go with me?
Well I believe you when you say you go to school.
You know I've been living here for almost three years.
Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody.
Yeah I went out for a couple of hours.
Did you go out?
It's Thursday.
Where you been all day?
Well what do you want to know?
I'll bring them over later...
So what's your name today?
I'll be back later.
A day like any other.
People come people go.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
I'll take you home.
I like it to be what it is.
Whatever you like it to be.
What should my name be?
Thank you very much Mr...?
What do you do on the other days?
So why go to college?
I'm a college girl.
What do you do now?
You talk kind of funny but I like it.
No not always.
Do you always ask so many questions?
You always drink like this so early in the morning?
Then why go to the bus station?
It's the lights.
Can I buy you another drink?
Can I sit down?
What time does the bus leave?
Just a cup of black coffee please...
How long have you been waiting?
How long you been waiting?
Long wait for a bus?
You name it.
For how much?
You watch me.
You got a bet.
I mean that ever happen to you?
You know this is my table man.
I own it.
That's what the game's all about.
Boy he is great!
That's right too.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Where do you come from?
We'll both go.
You have to go.
He'll never stop.
Leave this place.
I want to talk.
Do you still want me to stay?
You want me to stay?
when I was one of them.
Have you always had it?
How long can you live like that?
What choice did I have --?!
You're not them.
You want to find them.
Where you lived with them.
Do you remember where it is?
Was this -- ""beautiful?
When you're here in the city where do you live?
Place to place.
I was outside.
Do you remember where you lived?
It comes back.
How much do you remember?
Do you want to go on?
It could help all of you.
We could find some way to --
You lived like this once.
What are you planning to do tomorrow?
They're back.
I have to be careful.
Did you meet any interesting people today?
Well it's not supposed to be done anyway.
That watch out baby here comes Mr.
I remember the first time we met.
You built things.
I'm working on a site back in --
Hell of a night.
Only got one kind.
Need some gas?
Better now son?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.
It was so real Dad.
What Jim what?
I lost it.
Are you all right Dad?
But it was big.
Are you sure you saw that?
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Should we call it a night?
I for one have had a long day.
Which one's that?
There are more this year than last.
It's that time of year again.
We should get a pretty good show out here.
Let's see what's on the other side.
It's got a name.
There's the town.
Let's check it out Dad.
If we want it it is.
This can be your room if you want it.
What's that Dad?
You'll meet new friends.
But I have to move son.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
I know son.
I'm getting a good job.
It's a pretty part of the country.
Do we have to?
You know it really is beautiful up there.
We'll take a walk after dinner.
I'm home now.
They said you left hours ago.
I left it at work.
Where's your car?
I've got to run.
I'll take you to school.
I'll probably be gone all day.
Is that all he said?
What did he talk to you about?
I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
What do you mean -- gone?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
What sort of training do you have anyway?
We were having a little talk.
May I ask why?
Yes I do Mr.
I understand Miss that you have my son in your office.
You're looking for life?
Let's try.
He was talking in our class.
I'll bet he could do something.
We've got to get help.
All their lines were busy.
Did you call the State Police?
The State Police.
We'll be very careful.
But we have to see.
No but it was here.
I saw them.
Tell me what happened!
I'd believe him.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
How did it get Mrs.
Then it gets the police and your teacher too.
Can you tell me about that?
Dad's all the time moving.
Moving is hard for anybody.
Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
This is a new town for you.
Do you like it here?
It's all this moving from place to place.
I have school.
The back door was open.
Your father asked you a question.
George where have you been?
What do you think he saw?
But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You too.
Well come on you two.
Time to go to bed.
I wonder if you'd take the call.
They're from out of state.
His teacher brought him in to see me.
Just moved here.
But at last we'll be together.
This could be our last night on Earth.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
It's really nice of you to help us.
You bet it did.
You left me for him.
You still believe in him.
I take it you've heard.
We have to tell this to the President.
I want you to leave with us.
Walk to the window.
Right in front of you.
How'd you get this number?
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
You have to leave the White House.
All you need is love.
Love was never our problem.
All he could think about was getting to you.
There's still love there I think.
He told you about that?
Then get them out of there.
We knew what we had to do.
A lot of people died today.
More than likely.
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Can you believe this?
Oh good good.
That's my man.
That's the good news?
What's the bad news?
There's good news and bad news.
We've tried.
What the hell is this?
Started this morning.
It was turned on.
What'd I say?
This I can see.
What the hell are you doing!?
Area fifty one.
Still he gets sick?
Sure he'll listen.
You can do that?
Believe me they know.
She works for the President.
They know everything.
I'm only saying it's been what?
So think already.
I'm thinking.
What are you waiting?
Game's over.
You as well.
Just getting a feel for her.
We'll meet you there.
Oh shit we're late.
President just what do you think you're doing?
Then find them.
But what General?
Better than we thought.
How're we doing?
Any news on my wife?
Is my wife in the air?
Then God help us.
You knew all about this.
That's not your call to make Mr.
It's doing what?
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Sorry for what?
Before we do this I want you to know I'm sorry.
Baby you know how it is.
Call them back.
He's doing a good job.
I want you to meet the First Lady.
What about your future?
It's good money.
So what do you do for a living?
"" We're moving in.
I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I had them make it...
What else do they want you to learn?
But I gave you some this morning.
What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
How' he doing?
I think we should follow them.
We should leave too.
I'm still your father.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
They let you out?
What are we supposed to do now?
Where are we supposed to go now?
And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
I said call them back.
Two words Mr.
Hit 'em with everything we've got.
What do you want us to do?
And before here?
Where do your people come from?
Where is your home?
Why did you people come here?
May we go home now please?
Did you say...?
Got it here.
And I am his.
Everything's under control.
You are on your own?
Now we know.
Your father would know.
Your father did know.
""  But where exactly?
It's better now I've seen this.
It's the name of a city.
How's the head?
Dad was onto something here!
Maybe he'll know us.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
This is his whole life.
Why would he have sent this to me?
But whatever it is he's in over his head!
Very well done indeed.
All my life!
All your life.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
You've got it!
Follow met I know the way!
The Name of God...
Try not to talk.
The Word of God...
It's war.
Look what you did!
We're through!
I'm through!
Ready to go down in history?
We already have.
Along with all his research.
You could be more right than you know.
I've heard this one as well.
But only one of them made it.
What good is it?
Where do you start looking?
Where did this come from?
Have a look over here.
This might interest you.
I know who you are Mr.
Yours and mine.
I always turn up.
Is that what you think of me?
You came back for the book?
I want it.
So it did.
I think he's in here.
What do you know about this place?
You like the way I do things.
You had it?
What were they looking for?
You said go between them!
I said go around!
It must be one of these...
You're a great deal like your father.
Until we find out why I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
It would make me very happy.
I knew it was you --
What did you find Dad?
Get out of there Dad!
Now who are all these people?
Dad we're well out of range.
What do you think you're doing?!
This could be close.
It happens to me all the time.
It's a new experience for me.
I know Dad!
Son I'm sorry.
They got us.
Dad are we hit?!
We'll find out.
Look we have work to do.
I'm here now.
Dad how can you?
Did I ever tell you to eat up?
Go to bed?
Actually I was a wonderful father.
It was just the two of us Dad.
For you too.
We never talked.
I was the next man.
What did you get?
Oh yes she did.
Only too well.
But what are they?
All right Dad -- tell me.
What about the boat?
Come on Dad.
I'm out Dad!
All right move!
Do what I do.
And the chair.
The floor's on fire!
I ought to tell you something.
What am I looking for?
-- I made that up!
You said he had two days' start.
I came here to save you.
Take it easy?!
Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?
Will you take it easy!
Yeah big ones.
If only I could have been with you.
you did it.
Well what was left of him.
He was actually there?
You saw him?
I knew it.
I got it and I used it.
You obviously got it.
Well I am sorry about your head though.
But I thought you were one of them.
Dad get your stuff.
And the head.
You hit me Dad!
I came to get you!
But what are you doing here?
You listen to me --
It's important!
I'm not exactly...
A long time to wait.
That was seven hundred years ago.
They have them.
Come on -- come on!
I came to find my father.
If you let me go I will tell you where he is.
Where's my father
It's yours!
This is your last chance.
How's yours?
Talk -- or you're dead.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
I carried her back to her room.
Makes you wonder what these people are...
I'm sure it's nothing.
These people are like children.
Please come with me I'll show you!
Something awful's happened.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
I saw it!
But look at me -- my god I've to get ready!
You should have been there...
Yes I understand.
They also said their children were taken from them.
Yes very fine.
But not all of the pieces look old.
I had a question Mr.
We'll be on out way in the morning.
No we're not lost.
I would say you look rather lost.
Sure I found him.
Then last night I had a little trouble.
Come one what's wrong?
see you in the morning...
Yeah that's what happened...
He was afraid of you.
Did you see his eyes?
To get you here?
That's far enough!
You do not believe me?
They are here -- somewhere.
We say we will not.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Nobody brought us here.
What's happened here?
Who knows what might happen.
There's got to be another way out.
Yes they believe you.
So now they believe me.
Did you talk to them?
I want to go home...
Please -- help me...
You're all right now.
Wait -- what're you doing?
What is it...?
I am -- it looks horrible!
GET US OUT!
GET US OUT OF HERE!
What's that?!
There's stuff all over the floor!
Get it off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
you'll be back over here in five minutes...
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Yeah -- and nothing else.
You're nice.
No -- real food.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
He's afraid of something.
Just try and control yourself.
I meant for safety.
What does the writing say?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
What about the future?
"" So look where I got.
He'll be okay.
Thanks for nothing!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
It's starting to let go!
Do exactly what I tell you now.
What're you waiting for?!
What'd he say now?
And then they took their children.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.
What do you mean -- how?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
How do you know we're in --
Where are we anyway?
No look out Short Round!
I'm not that kind of girl!
So the game's not over.
I like the service here.
You take this time for your own you two.....
I'll get us out of here.
I take it all back everything I've said about you.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
You're lovely.
She's so lovely.
She's in love with you.
Anyone can see that.
I know it's no good.
I think I'm in love with her.
You've changed your mind.
She is beautiful.
Like she did all along.
She tried to help us get away.
She works for them.
Looks like you can have all you want.
How do we get out?
Never mind that where are we now.
It's just money.
Would have kept most people busy.
He must not know.
It's in the watch.
While he makes the run.
It's not the one...
Just say the words.
Just like I told you.
Not sure at all.
You sure this will work?
I was afraid of that.
Are you out of your mind.
Never mind just say it.
Door to the right.
Get up and run.
A hard left.
You have to!
Drink lots of water.
I know she's not with them.
I know something else.
That's what you're good at.
Let me do this.
You're Okay.
Down to your heart.
Just stay here and rest.
That's not funny.
Come on she's getting away.
We are trying to stand out.
Easier to get them to come to us than to try and find them.
now keep your eyes open something might present itself.
It's not better.
You found her.
You been had.
That's what I'll do!
What will you do.
What do you hope?
I just hope.
And you got no one to help you.
And you know what I'll do?
It's not your time.
I get time off.
And on my time.
You're in love.
She's got the most beautiful...
Oh you were right.
They've all been here before...
met just last week.
What she say.
What'd you get out of her?
You got any books in there?
What if she says something important?
You're doing great with her.
look at her.
Every time I try her you look away.
They're all in it.
I've lost something.
I must get it back.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Stay on them.
Stay on them will you.
How can we find out...
That's a big if.
You got a better idea you tell me.
Other than her there's no one here I know.
You're not just after this girl are you?
Get close to them.
They both look good to me.
The beautiful one.
Which one is she?
What did that cost?
But the rest is me.
It is my business.
It's my name.
Mind your own business.
Not blue enough.
Much too blue.
I can see out!
What's nothing look like?
it looks like nothing.
But what's it look like?
Now where would I be?
But you've got to have...
Well you did it today.
I made it work.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
You're on your own.
Help me out will you?
Try another language.
You're beautiful..
She's beautiful...!
This must be business there's nothing else here.
Now EAT it!
Just eat it.
You eat it.
Little late for that.
Just get there.
You'll be me.
Oh yeah to what?
Nothing but it's yours.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
how you carry yourself.
It's just not enough.
They'll know who I am.
You are in trouble.
Now do it.
I'll get in trouble.
What about money?
Send a man there.
You just do nothing.
Get to a phone.
I'm back.
Hey wait a minute.
Where did he get you?
To get out of here.
They're probably long gone.
That's not a good idea.
They know I'm in here.
We've got to find them.
What did he look like the man?
He told me to get a drink.
Have you been here before.
Take a left and your next right.
What does it say.
Which way do I go?
Just walk down the hall?
Go out take your first left.
We have to get out of here.
piece by piece.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
We're a team...
I brought you back here.
What do you mean we.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.
We'll have to do it on our own.
They're not the type of people we need.
there's no chance.
You have no choice you're involved.
Will you help?
I just want to go home.
They want you.
I want out.
Whatever you do just...
He's not the problem.
If I'm real they'll get me out.
Either way you'll be better off than you are now.
I'll tell you what to say.
Somebody out there?
With a man in my head...
I'll explain it all.
wait a minute just let me explain.
Of course you do!
Used to be things were bad.
Then how'd I get here?
I just went there for a job.
You explain it.
What'd I do?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Anyway who are you?
If you're in my head...
to you I'm...
Somebody's been here.
I need to make a phone call.
We're on the street.
We're walking down the street.
We're talking to ourselves.
I just got here.
You're in my head?

and he's in my head.
You're in my head...
On a bus
Who's you?
No not her.

I said something.
Some friend you are!
You know what I hope?
It's like.
It's real strong like.
And I got your information.
Now get off my back!
I've got twenty hours left.
Face it we're the men for the job.
It's all we've got.
I knew you were trouble.
What kind of a deal?
In my own way...
I want you to know that...
You're quite a guy.
I'm against it.
I've seen that before.
Never had anyone actually do it.
The best part.
What part what?
It's a long story.
Who's our little man?
She found out what she could...
We'll let you go.
How about a deal?
We're all getting old.

What are you doing here where've you been?
Who is your friend?
I think I've heard of you.
I came for a rest.
As I imagine you did.
To get away with it all.
I try to give them whatever they want.
It is to me too.
Much better now thank you.

You may not remember things.
And you there are many places to get away.
She's not your wife is she...?

Good choice sir.
Now you know what I know.
and who is it!?
You said   something first.
What's what?
I have to get away.
He should do it in person...
I told you I work for him.
That's twenty feet high.
If he was able what would he say.
It was me.
He just told me how...
I wish he could tell me now.
But you did it.
He told me what to do.
You are I've seen you.
I'm no good at this.
I told him.
Who do you work for?
I'll come back for you.
I've never met anyone like you.
I took it out on you.
Why did you then?
It was my choice.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Nobody knows about us.
Nothing we can do.
You can say that again.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
What did you tell them?
They asked about you.
Looks like they can.
What did they do?
You coming along?
You've  been there?
It's back the other way.
I'm in full control.
Maybe I'm wrong.
He's a client of mine!
What's the matter.
Why'd you ask him.
I asked him.
Get us one.
This may take some time.
We figure out if it's in here.
It was a good job.
take care of things.
Just went along for the party.
They'd never talk in front of me.
You think I'm like that?
Get your things.
He mentioned a city.
The most important one.
Can you help me find him?
Goes in a computer.
We're very close.
He must be a good friend.
From a friend of mine.
What's he done?
You know where he went?
Now so am I...
What's so interesting about him?
This business is over.
Did he put you up to it?
Were you working for him last night?
I told you I did.
Why did they leave?
There's not much to tell.
Your friends did they ask about me?
Who else is interested in me?
You seemed interesting.
Wanted to get to know you.
Why did you stay with me?
I had to go with them.
Why did you leave?
Why'd you run off?
And you what do you like?
They were here last week.
How often they come here?
No one at all.
Who do you?
Made that up.
You're doing...
And how'm I doing?
You're talking to me.
That was then.
This is now.
Who am I talking to?
You talk to yourself.
Course if I was I'd be the last to know.
Can I help?
As if your mind's not all there.
and sort of...
You mean from it.
Like there's someone else here.
Why do you talk   that way?
What's so funny?
Let you leave without it.
right here too.
I'll be right there.
something he said...
Or maybe it's you.
No one to speak of.
Is someone else here?
I'm looking for someone.
What do you do about what?
What about the others.
If it's not him it must be you.
If it's not you it must be him...
Why are you on to him?
Thanks to you.
Piece of mind.
What could you find in this place?
Everybody always wants something.
Will you be able to wait?
I've had it since nine.
We're running behind.
so few jobs...
all of you.
what are you doing here?
That's alright.
It would take hours.
Could I have it please.
The back up.
It will be fine.
You have another.
The other working.
So we better get started.
Look nobody knows we did it.
What does he know?
I heard them.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
What's that outside Daddy?
So what's -- what's happening to you now is...
That's great...
What's new?
Alright we'll do that tomorrow.
He's into kind of little cars that...
You better take a good look!
Look look look.
When I get a chance I'll give it a look...
I'll take a look at what you got.
You bet we are.
I'll see if I can find him.
Hold on a second...
I'll be in tomorrow night...
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
When's the air date?
It's on record it's out.
It's out in the world...
What do you mean what's it do?
Oh I love that stuff.
I'm better...
do you need?
I should have.
Not on any of it.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Take a look at this...
Doing my job.
Hey I'll tell you what...
You're taking ""no"" for an answer?
You know that?
But oh no not you.
"" That's what I hear.
They work for free.
Before you go...
As they start to leave...
No I'm not...
I'm afraid you are.
That's happening.
You alright Mr.
That computer has everything...
Do you own a.
If we could take a look Mr.
Yes I'm afraid I did.
You want it for the Evening News?
Well at the end of the day...
but if it did.
No no we're fine...
Shall I send for coffee?
We're all in this together.
We'll find out soon.
for everyone else...
Call me back in ten.
Well until you do all I can tell you is what you already know...
This is The New York Times.
How are you Jim?
Are we talking...
Did I tell you you were wrong?
You're sure you want to do this?
Here's how it works.
You ask me questions.
I tell you if you're wrong.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
I want to stand by my husband...
I am so sorry...
That's for food.
What's the difference...
Do you know what they will do to us...!
What are we supposed to do...?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
That's my stuff from the office...
You need anything?
Try the car.
I can take her.
No you do not.
Press is free...
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go work somewhere else.
What the hell for?
Who's this from?
you understand any of this...?
Let me see this...
Let me call you back...
Everybody is on the line here.
Everything you say!
What do you care?
No it's okay...
How's -- how's the new place?
Is it too late?
It would be better if he called us.
Well would you want him to call you?
Or you want to call him?
How do you want to do it?
Well actually no.
Has he decided to go public?
What's your interest in this Mr.
I'll call you then.
Yes I'm right here.
Could you call me back on a hard line?
Hang in with us.
You'll be fine...
You came out okay in the end...
Still interest you?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Now what do you think you think about then?
After I'm gone.
No you give me a break!
What the hell did you expect?
What get over it?
Give me a break!
To show me the way.
Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?
Not one fucking time!
You want to know why?
Did I get you up?
Get in the real world.
The answer is ""no.
That decision I've already made.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do...
on the line!
Give me a fucking break!
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time.
And if it is we air it.
What the hell do you expect?
And others will deal...
Thank you for saying that...
So is everything okay?
We got a guy...
Said they should be afraid of him...
Now you tell me.
We're there.
I know it sounds odd...
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
What I've seen...
Yeah I will.
You try and have a good time.
Where are you anyway?
You think about that.
You think about them.
into where I am now...
That's the whole point.
What kind of shit is this?
I was young.
I was young...
Oh you know what we do or do not need to know?
I do not think that you ""know"" for me...
for my kids to have seen it...
for them to know why I've put them through what I did...
But you I mean I know how...
They do not want to air it.
since this morning?
What's changed?
Did you have a good day?
to talk about it.
To think about it.
What did she think she was coming to New York for?
They get to go home at night.
What does it cost these people to do this to us?
I want to tape!
I'm done thinking about it.
To my family?
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?!
Something to do on a Sunday night.
I believe that?
Yes I believe that.
And that's the power you have.
What you are is important.
I could be anything.
I'm asking you questions.
She went to her mother's.
Well my father left us when I was five-years old.
Then you get to ask all the questions?
What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Next to your father?
What did you get us?
Look, thanks for talking.
Makes you feel good?
Putting what you know to use?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...
I wanted to talk to you.
About what we were talking about in your car.
So, what about?
You have kids?
The new place?
I've always thought of myself...
That's what's wrong with it.
The work I was supposed to do...
might have had some positive effect.
I took the money.
My wife was happy.
Got a great house.
I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Okay, so, here you are...
The hell with everything else.
they got up in front of Congress that time...
it was on television...
They should be.
I did not.
And you got something important to say.
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Use your head.
It happened after I talked to you.
This is my house...
In front of my wife my kids?!
What business do we have?
I did not give you up to anyone!
You sold me out!
If you want to do it.
How much would I get paid?
Where do you work?
I can talk to you about what's in here.
Far as you go where?
but that's as far as I go...
I know what I have to know.
Is there anything you want to know about me Mr.
How do you like your coffee?
That's room service.
Come on in...
Over here please.
No you can.
Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Alright now listen to me.
I want you -- I want you to tell him in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
What's happening?!
Hello can you hear me now?
Did he hear you?
Just tell him I'm on the phone with you...
Just tell him that.
I think I need to call the police.
And so I moved out...
I see the girls a couple of days a week...
What do you mean there is no family?
There is -- there is no family.
How's the family okay?
Then hold it off the air until you got that.
But I want to go to New York.
And I want to go on the record.
You called me.
Well no look...
It's probably not important at all.
You know I got a job now.
Are they doing it?
Well what do you really think though?
I mean maybe it's a game.
Some kind of mind game.
Did you call the police?
She's okay.
We have a couple.
Just give me an example...
""There are times...
"" ""I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it.
I think it's worth it.
""I would bet on it.
If you asked me would I do it again?
Do I think it's worth it?
Yeah I think it's worth it.
And the reason he gave you?
what is common language within the company...
All of us did.
There was this whole line of people...
I believe Mr.
You heard Mr.
Whether the hell you like it or not!
It's on the record.
How does one...
"" What does my family do?
If my wife has to work?
Put food on the table?
My children need me.
When should we do this?
If you'd be interested in talking to us we'd certainly like to talk to you...
I was paid well for my work.
we worked together for what was it three years...?
Yeah I know you do...
You know I came up through sales.
Most people consider what they're saying...
I'd rather play than talk about it.
What did you want to see me about?
So he says now!
They hate each other --
And -- there's no talking her out of it.
You are so HOT!
I told you we know each other baby.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
-- and we are sure...
Well -- at the moment that'd be me.
-- understand what you're asking for here.
I just want to make sure that you both --
I had no idea until after but --
My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children.
She was your best friend.
Got one right here.
And how is Mrs.
Here's her picture...
I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Did you really mean what you said on the phone.
Is this Mr.
Who's next, Mrs.
That was -- oh, shit.
What if he's on his way over there?
So, that's good, right?
In the middle of a business meeting.
What do you mean, was.
It's your move, Miles.
You have the ring.
I have the ring.
I have it.
I'm still...
He's the wrong man.
You're in check.
We did not.
Why in God's name would I want...?
You need it.
Not this one.
She got absolutely nothing.
If he only knew.
He said to make the house mine.
I said yes.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Why do you think she did it?
You like kids.
What if something happened to you?
It's not something I wanted either.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
No matter what happened to you.
Wait just a second there.
You sent him here.
But first he worked for you.
He works for YOU?
You do love me?
Leave the house.
I'm sorry Miles.
I will Miles.
I will leave.
So am I right?
What kind of ""stuff?
Got a light?
I'm talking about --
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
May I come in?
I'm sorry Darling.
I love it.
It is YOU.
Can you just...
What's wrong Miles?
Did I spend too much?
I want to have your baby.
Here's my card.
Spend as much as you want.
Make this your house.
I want you close to me.
I'll move to the...
That's all I've ever wanted.
I have a watch.
Yes you do have more experience?
What else could those words mean?
You have more experience at this than I do.
I want YOU to be MY wife.
I want to be your -- your wife.
I want to...
What is it Miles?
Stay with me for a while.
Thank you for the coffee.
There's nothing wrong with us.
I like us.
We are Miles.
You know I'm right.
There's something ""off"" about you and me Miles.
No we're not!
Your mother was.
And here I thought my mother was...
Boy oh boy.
She held that against you?
She would never not love her son.
And your mother was very beautiful.
It was from a client.
I just got that actually.
You have a very nice home Miles.
I live right near there.
You get out of the car.
Something you may or may not know.
When did I say...?
You're right about me.
I am nothing.
I figure a couple of months.
It was his idea.
Be happy for me Miles.
No that's not all.
So I hear.
We told you.
But why him?
You listen to me.
You left me with nothing!
What did you expect me to do?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Oh for the love of...
Have you ever met Mr.
Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
What is it you're after Miles?
See the tape.
Then I'm getting on with my life.
That's all I'm after.
All right Miles.
Let me tell you everything you THINK you know.
There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together.
I got five years older.
You're not my client.
You could get in trouble for that.
I know you do.
And the lady will have the same?
Why would you be here?
Did you see the tape?
These are yours.
And you must be Mr.
And you must be Mrs.
Sometimes I forget.
You have some?
You lost weight.
Get away from the door.
He never even asked.
Or yours for that matter?
Do you think he set me up?
How do you spend six figures in less than six hours?
Oh never mind I've seen it before.
I've seen everything.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Thank you Mrs.
Where were we?
Well that's about to change big time.
Miles is different.
Yes yes it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife.
He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Let's get some lunch.
You're not...
What was I supposed to say.
Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Nothing specific but I'll have my own place soon.
They left you with absolutely nothing.
So where are you now?
Well what does he want?
I'm not seeing anyone until this is over.
One husband at a time.
We do have a man for you.
Who's she?
He got you.
You thought she had money.
HA HA HA.
I heard all about it.
She's here now.
When does she --
When you have a moment.
Where does that leave us?
And it's good!
She's YOUR wife.
What kind of sick --
Maybe you're right Miles.
Seventy five percent.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Why not ask for a hundred percent?
She said to say hello.
She always looked out for me.
Well -- is that possible?
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
You know what I mean when I say ""it.
That's her job.
You're the one with the -- the...
I'd stay away from her Miles.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Even with the business we're in I -- it gets me every time.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I am very sorry.
And she has...?
He wants to give her...?
That's her name.
But she changed it after seeing ""Some Like It Hot.
What else would she be?
Did you know Mrs.
But I've been out of town.
Hard to believe I know.
You know -- you are her...?
We were quite close.
Well you can live here as long as you want.
And all seven of his children
He's in fish.
He is fish.
Maybe next time.
It's not so bad these days.
I'll just keep having children.
After all something might have happened to her.
It's not enough!
I've put extra men on all along the way.
I want her found!
Oh no sir.
No different than
How is she?
I asked you a question.
She's my idea of nothing!
Now how about the check.
Do I get it?
All you seem to
We'll go into that some other time.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty.
If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place.
What ten thousand?
Let me get this straight.
Yes I knowbut
Please understand me.
Pay him off.
He did an excellent job.
I'm sorry you read it.
Looks like that was his only interest in me.
Oh please Dad
Oh nono.
Is that his name?
I'll never see Peter again.
I've been doing it all my life.
He's right that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
But that's silly child.
Seeing how you feel why
No I'll go through with it.
It's no use Dad.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Oh come now
It'll do no good.
On the road.
This must be serious.
Where'd you meet him?
You know how I feel about him.
But I want to make you happy.
Well everything's set.
Oh hello Dad.
Just the way I like it.
I'll never thank you!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.
I'm sick of it!
Never mindI'll get it myself.
That was enough.
You only met him once.
You probably were.
You'll never do it!
That what You'll have.
Where are you taking me?
Not so far as I'm concerned you're not.
You ought to know why.
Stop being silly.
Do anything you want!
Know what my next move is?
That's to see you.
Of course I mean it!
If you really mean it I will.
That's why I sent for you.
Will you do that?
Why should she?
Well you can help now.
Want her back at all costs!
Nothing terrible about her.
She's great!
Got a mind of her own.
Knows just what she wants.
Has no money.
What a hell cat.
They're terrible!
Go after her.
It's not quite that simple.
When'd she eat last?
We've done that already.
Well see you later.
It's your only chance.
Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.
Do we understand each other?
What would you like to have me do?
She's been too much for me.
You never can tell.
Oh she's no responsibility.
You talk as if
All right You win.
I'll just have to get used to you.
I never have!
I never will!
I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand.
Well it ought to be.
What do they say?
Want to hear them?
Will continue to do everything possible.
Forget it son.
What happened to your money?
But the lady says
Never mind son.
All right let it go.
Phone for help?
You'll never get out yourself!
Better phone for some help.
Now that's a brilliant answer.
Our conversation could have been over long ago.
But I do.
The only one I've got.
It's okay with me.
On the level it actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.
That's a long story my friend.
What do you think you're doing!
Same to you.
You bet I did.
I hope you got your money.
We can run away.
Everything'll take care of itself.
Better go back to your bed.
Suresure I've thought about it.
Everybody's in bed.
We could make New York in less than three hours.
Talked him out of it.
I'll have to think of something before morning.
What'd you give him for the car?
There's a cut on
Come onget in.
You could have stopped forty cars.
Nobody can do anything but you.
Mind if I try?
Something must have gone wrong.
Now watch me.
Here comes a car!
Oh that's nothing.
Different ways to do it though.
Depends on how you feel.
Well it is simple.
A lot of people do it
Oh they'll stop all right.
We let a car get away.
If it's just the same to you we'll sit right here till they come.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
What are you thinking about?
I only work when I have to.
Eat your head off.
Just went out to find you something to eat.
What's got into you?
Do whatever you please.
But shut up about it.
Well take them off.
Not a one.
That's silly.
And he carried you like this I suppose.
Hang on to these.
To New York?
How do you expect to get there?
It takes money to buy food.
Why did we have to leave the bus?
Nothing you can do.
I better go over and see her.
Then I'll fire you.
I'll do all the parts myself.
You always want to run everything.
Oh you are!
Who made you the manager?
Say you were pretty good.
You're just like your old man!
Well you were!
I told you a million times!
That's what you told me the last time too.
There you go again!
That's Father at work What'll I do?
Peter what'll I do?
Just goes to show you.
I ought to write a book about it.
Is that how you met him?
You're doing all right.
I never have.
Would you believe it?
It's too good a story.
I mean running away and everything.
Come on sit down.
Said I looked funny.
High time you got back.
I'll find it myself.
Heretake mine.
Pleased to meet you Mr.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.
I got a name.
Do you mind putting out the light?
But that's where I'm different.
After that I
Funny thing about that.
You're not really serious about this are you?
It's all right with me.
A simple story for simple people.
Thank you very much but you've been very kind.
All right I'm here to help you.
A day-to- day account.
I need that story.
Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Yeah not bad.
How's your's?
Oh you did?
Are you talking to me!
You're on a budget from now on.
What do you mean
The only way you can get anything is to buy it.
Will you help me?
"" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute.
I'm not interested in your money or your problems.
I'll pay you as much as he will.
I've got to get to New York without being stopped.
I never thought of that.
Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
I can take care of myself.
You missed the bus too.
Say how old are you anyway?
What time is the next bus to New York?
You lost your bag.
The company'll make good.
About your bag I mean.
Why noI  Yes.
No I've got that all right.
But my money.
I've got to get to New York with it.
Boy how that baby can run!
It's gone!
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Are you talking to me?
They're not living.
Sure it does.
You hate yourself.
The world's full of people like you.
Well I am.
Want to see me?
Do you think they'd see me?
I'm out!
sixseveneightnine
I believe you would.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Hey wait a minute!
Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this!
Whatever you say darling.
It's up to you now.
We'll never let up will we?
No time to think.
You bet we did.
Let's drink to us.
Are you happy?
Why that's twelve hours!
I was on that busI told them to wait!
Left twenty minutes ago.
Where's the bus to New York?
In about fifteen minutes.
When does the bus leave?
Can I use your telephone?
I want to talk to New York.
What makes you think so!
Why he'll be back.
And the car's gone too.
Yesif he is your husband.
Where's your husband young lady
I was just trying to make conversation.
Hey what's this?
You're my type.
I could go for you in a big way.
That's pretty good.
Who do you think she was?
Might as well give up.
What's the matter sister?
Heyyou not up yet?
Come oncome on!
I've been thinking about you.
Oh by the waywhat's your name?
See the lights?
What's it say?
""Have I got a story!
Hope you're the same.
Say listen you!
Yeah where am I?
But that's the way things go.
All women are beautiful!
I've got to get right back.
Well I'll be
Been with her every minute.
You ought to know when I'm serious.
This is on the level.
I'd put you there myself.
It's all right here.
Give me the thousand and it's yours.
If it's on the level.
This is something you got to do for me.
I got it all written up.
Ready to go.
Well I got one now.
That's okay by me!
When I get through with that
I'd start a new department.
Well you got one now.
Listen manI'll tell you what I'll do.
Yeah but I got a bag.
My wife gave me one for Christmas.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York.
What do you reckon that's for?
Well try and get it.
What I said about never writing another line for you still goes.
I'm just fine thanks and how are you?
Not a minute!
Took the car with him too.
Let's do something about it.
He's gone!
How many times did I tell you
Anything you say.
And stay away from that bus.
Just remember that.
I never talk.
Take my word for it.
Know what happened?
How do I know?
before I What're you trying to do?
Tell the whole world about it!
You know too much.
I got a couple of kids.
What's the matter with you!
What else stupid!
I'll let you have one of them.
He looks up quickly.
Lucky thing my running into you.
Just the man I need.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you.
Well you're two up on me now.
I value Bill as much as anyone here.
It went all over the country.
Not one word.
That's an order.
Here white is black and black is white.
I wish I could help you Jim.
Did he pay?
And you were the only one here today...
I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I mean you really are.
Just goes to show you can never know about some people.
Hell all these years I thought you were on my side.
I want some company tonight.
What the hell do we really got?
Or a cover up!
Listen real hard.
You're a young guy...
I'm talking as a friend now.
It's you I want to talk to Bill.
Keep saying what?
You know you keep saying that.
No one really knows what they were doing there but everyone sure saw 'em.
The way they let him go.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
I thought we were on the same side.
Everybody down here knows the guy.
What's the other name?
You too Bill even if you're family.
Goes by another name down here.
I've been to every bar no one wants to talk.
Sure I know him.
He comes around the Quarter.
That's what I'm here for.
Did he pay you for this?
How the hell do you know who your daddy is?
Bill was one of his best men.
It makes sense to me.
Break it up.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Who found the evidence?
Who set him up?
Take it at face value.
What's in a name right?
I'll go you one better!
That's what you're saying!
What are we saying here?
Does that bother you Bill?
Well I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
They been doing it for years.
How do they figure in this?
And he'll use 'em.
I'll stay as long as you want.
They're after me.
It's almost over.
Come on Dave come on our side.
What did they...
You know when you talk to people they talk to other people.
What are you talking about Dave?
I'm a dead man!
From here on believe me I'm a dead man.
I'm out on the street.
Do you know what you've done to me?
It's all over the national news now.
You know what you've done to me?
You think we want that?
Yeah you got it.
Get some rest Dave and you'll feel better in the morning.
We'll talk then.
You know at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.
And then I lost that.
And then I started to lose everything.
Once they got you you're in for life.
Black black - just give it to me.
Had it for years.
Let me get this straight now.
Check them out.
Who was paying you Dave?
Oh you got that?
Getting paid by the government to work against the government.
What a mind he had what a guy Guy.
Dave thank you for your time.
Yes now I remember Mr.
Oh yes well come to think of it they're right.
I believe the boys got a couple.
And then Sunday?
No particular reason.
Just to go somewhere.
And where did you drive?
Yeah now that's true.
There is one other matter that's come up Dave.
No I never saw him before in my life.
I'm sure you've seen this.
Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
There were lots of kids in and out...
How could I?
How could I forget?
Do you remember me Mr.
Come in Dave.
Well I am saying it.
That's our case!
I call'em as I see'em Jim.
Can I stay up another hour?
We have that taken care of.
No one you hear?
Four to six.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?
Keep on it Bill.
No one knows.
Does she have a problem getting out?
Does he have any problems?
If he has something to say it'll be there.
Now just a minute sir!
You're way out of line!
May I go?
And if I was Mr.
do you think I would be here today...
talking to somebody like you?
Please answer the question.
No it was not.
Is that the man you had in mind?
Let me show you his picture.
I have never known anyone by that name.
Of course never having met Mr.
in the course of that night Mr.
along with another young man...
As you well know.
I'm not sure I understand.
I know but Mr.
""  That's not true.
I'll never forget that day.
And if you're wrong?
I'm taking the kids to my mother's.
I am - I am.
So do I!
And yours is too!
I want my life back!
I've had enough!
Everybody in town's talking.
Of course I've changed!
You've changed.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.
Spend a week.
You and your government!
What kind of man are you?
Get a hold of yourself.
Our home Jim!
A man just called.
He asked her everything!
Did they live?
All day long the kids are asking ""Where's Daddy?
""  What am I supposed to tell your kids Jim!
I'm sorry but it's important.
I'll bring him in on a Sunday.
Do you have any evidence against him Jim?
These books are getting to your mind Mr.
Some Saturday night date you are.
Well maybe you're right Jim.
until the kids are in bed.
Then you're mine and Mr.
Come on now we'll talk about it at the table dinner's getting cold.
What are you doing in here?
Jim dinner's just about ready...
tried something new...
It's important to know why you're telling us this.
I told you so.
And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Having a party.
Minutes hours days years of'em.
I want to thank you Mr.
You sure got it.
Well if that's what you want to call it.
We need him back.
If we stopped now it'd be even more wrong.
While we're still a little behind.
This is our case!
We'll talk tomorrow.
Somebody else did.
A hit and run.
Can we find her?
Take a look across the street.
Who would be running that training?
He died couple years ago.
He's been in trouble before.
I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
No word yet.
But they think it's in the head.
Five minutes ago.
Sure they do.
Why would they?
Call me whatever you like.
May I call you Jim?
What happened to our country..
to the world...
It never did.
the whole thing.
It's like it never happened.
That's him.
The way he walked...
What was he doing there?
And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
That picture of yours.
He'll never give you a straight answer.
Ever ask him?
and your General?
He's done it before.
How do you think it started?
Well thanks for coming.
I hope you get a break...
No chance in hell Mr.
The size of this is...
Do your own work your own thinking.
In our time - in our country?
Well I just hope it was worth my while Mr...
Not with me sir never...
Listen I think I'd better go.
I said enough.
Yeah he was there too...
But he was there all right.
Was he there often?
You have other information?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
How much more?
But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill.
Here take a look at it.
And he never hit you before?
More than ten years.
You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
It's a means to an end.
He'll never make it.
He'll stop that war.
If you believe what's happening to these other people.
The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning my boy only the beginning.
And what would I have to do?
That's all you've had all this time?
How many men are working with you on this?
You were lucky.
We can use all the support we can get.
I think these might interest you.
Yes thank you Mr.
Would you care for some coffee?
Do you walk home?
I need some information from you then.
And then I want to leave this world.
No that could not be done Mr.
There are a good many things involved in that.
Can I make a statement?
Can you take me with you?
Oh that's not a problem.
Not a problem.
This looks pretty good on me.
Maybe it's a language problem.
But then you told her you were home.
That's why I went.
I'm sure she would.
I took my mother and little brother.
But the only way to help you was to do that so I did it.
Yes or no?
I got a problem with small places.
You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
They'll get the idea.
I need help and you can help me.
I'm home I'm high --
What'd ya mean?
You see it works like this.
You were there for me.
I'm serious man.
I found out.
How'd you know where he was?
Why were you with him?
Can I have a word with you?
What time do you have to be there?
She knows it's my case?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she want?
She wants to make a deal.
Great you're here.
Can she afford a good one is the question.
I'm meeting a woman.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
Can you do it or not?
But now you're telling us now you do.
Help us do what?
What's in it?
While you're at it let me see what else is in there.
Oh you're both?
He did time and you got off.
Cut to thirteen years later.
You're forty-four years of age.
Hey this is my office.
I'm not saying another word.
This is your money?
You have the right to say ""no.
Would I mind?
Do I have a choice?
Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
can I ask what you have in that bag?
Thank you for saying that but no.
Thanks but you have a good time.
Ever been there?
You'll get over that.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
I'm fifty-five-years old.
Not after they're dead.
I told him I might.
He's on to a new thing.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
Less ten percent.
He's already there.
I'm afraid of him.
He'll like that.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Tell him you want to see him?
Set him up.
That's why A.
How'd you find out?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Where's the rest of it?
He'll see fifty thousand.
It'll be more than that.
Do you think they bought it?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now it's only money.
It's evidence.
And is that it?
He never came home.
Nineteen years of this shit?
So I made up my mind that's it.
Did you do it that night?
You do that?
What do you do when he comes home?
Yeah that night I went to pick up a guy.
It's been a long time coming.
When did you decide?
A lot of reasons.
You know where it came from.
No I mean you right now.
Not it you were somebody else.
You know some interesting people.
But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
You think he's got a thing for you?
He's being real nice to me.
I called you last night.
You just missed him.
Sit down leave the bag under the table?
Right around here in the food court.
He always just picked it up at my place.
But with A.
involved I want to stage it.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
They seem to like the idea.
You talk them into it?
I go back to work tomorrow.
What're you a bag lady?
I'm old enough to be her father.
But I had to end it.
But there's always one who you love.
Does it happen to all men?
Oh are you?
Does she know that?
What're you up to?
I walked right past you.
I just feel like I'm always starting over.
Does something else worry you?
It's different with men.
How'd you feel about it?
So I did something about it.
It's not really something I think about.
I'm asking how you feel.
You're not old.
How do you feel about getting old?
If I get let off.
How do you get it out?
He needs me.
He came by.
He called you?
He told me last night.
It's a lot of money.
Well if the A.
guy is the one who wants you that'll only interest him up to a point.
I want to talk to them first.
I called in sick this morning.
This is pretty.
I got a few.
It looks nice.
Want to hear some music?
Thanks but I have my own now.
Black's fine.
You get a chance to use it?
If you're having some.
Give 'em what you got.
But he's got a problem.
With ten thousand?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time.
I have a pretty good idea.
man would be interested in.
He's the one who wants you.
Same as you.
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.
How do you know 'em?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to.
What did they want to know?
I had 'em too.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Yeah but that's not what this was about.
They knew I had that money they even knew the amount.
""Oh I'd say there's fifty thousand here.
That's State time.
What have they told you?
I am as a matter of fact.
They're hard to find here.
I lose it and put it back on.
There's a place by me.
I'd love one but not there.
I thought you might want a drink?
You're serious?
Can I see your I.
I gave you my card there.
You want to think about it?
You got two minutes before we're up.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Sometimes every day for a while.
Not every day?
Most of the times.
Do you live together?
I have no evidence of your taking anything.
Do you think I took some of that money?
And we have you.
So what happens now?
We were and we lost him.
I thought you were watching him.
If it'll make you happy.
I went looking for you.
How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened?
What did you do after that?
What am I supposed to do go after her?
Where's the bag she gave you?
I got there early.
I would think with all this on your mind you'd wait till after.
Yeah well it's not a point of view that A.
That would be one point of view.
All those things are true.
Or we could take what we want.
Oh that's taken care of.
You said that the last time.
Well this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with.
So everything's set for tomorrow?
Was she there?
She told you that?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What's her story?
Who's the other one?
Ever meet her or they talk about her?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
You talk to him?
This afternoon before I came here.
You two meet?
This is A.
How can you help us?
He told me.
man be after him?
You know how he makes his money?
You never asked me if I did or not.
Oh so now you know him?
If I'm working I can help you.
You know what we want.
I need it tomorrow.
We can look into that.
Now tell me what can we do for you?
We'll just be a minute.
I know what it looks like.
Now be careful with that bag.
What the hell he ever do for us?
Do you got something for me?
It looks good on you.
Yeah do you like it?
Keep it between us girls?
You know how easy it would be?
So tell me.
You already knew that?
He told me to go outside.
""You may leave us now.
"" You know Mr.
Almost a year.
That guy's been in there since I got here.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Only that it's money.
You and him friends now?
You tell him about this shit?
He'll take care of it.
She knows what I look like?
I tell them we're doing it the same way as before.
Now hold on there.
I was there I saw her do it.
How do you know she did that?
What'd you care?
I get some food and sit down here in the food court.
Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
I can do that.
Plus the same deal as before.
I'll give ya ten.
Manager's get fifteen percent.
Well it's my plan.
We're in this together.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
In the food court.
Can you cover that?
So we need two people two women.
No I give it to someone else first.
Yeah I think a woman.
One of your friends.
They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
I told 'em you're real careful.
You never pick up money yourself.
You always send someone and I never know who it is.
They watch it.
See how it works.
What did they say?
You told them that?
So I give them something they already know.
They already know it's you.
I told them.
They know I'm meeting you.
I do okay.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I got a problem...
If I have to do more than a year you pay another hundred thousand.
Now let's say if I tell on you I walk.
Way I see it me and you only got one thing to talk about.
I just came here to talk.
They turn black against black that's how they do.
Go sit over in that chair.
I said you understand what I'm saying
Understand what I'm saying?
I just carry that.
You thought right...
They told me.
And they asked if I knew Mr.
And what was your answer?
The same guy who put me in thanks a lot.
Yeah down the end.
Okay you got it.
I can carry it.
I'm getting out of here.
All right already.
and just take it from him.
And your point is?
You live with him.
Does that bother you?
That's not what I'm saying at all.
So what are you trying to tell me?
I should get out of here?
Well so far he is.
Is it dead?
Now that's over let's get to know each other.
That sounds like a problem.
I never got to know him really.
That's the guy I lived with...
his name was...
About five years ago.
I lived there for about nine months.
I went to a few just to meet women.
Did you ever go I one?
We had done time together already.
So where did you go?
I thought you were sixteen.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah there's another hit left.
Is it ready to go?
Four days ago.
Want a hit?
He knows a lot.
I can sit through it once.
How am I supposed to know that?
Hell yes they know each other.
The bag felt right.
Pull the car over.
Maybe a minute.
She came right out.
How long was she in there?
It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Look that's the bag she came out with.
You light about a half-a-million.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe forty maybe not that much.
How much it there?
Well if you had to do it you had to do it.
Anybody but that woman.
So you're sure she's dead.
but at that moment...
You know how she is.
So what you left her there.
Not now pick me up.
That's what I got to talk to you about.
When I see you.
Listen there's something else I have to tell you.
Did you get it?
Hang it up she's on her way.
I told you man.
I know the woman.
Close as she's ever been anyway.
She one of the women I got set up.
So we on the same page then?
Now that my friend is a clear case of him or me.
Me and Mr.
Shit you better think again.
What did he do?
You're outside?
I got them set just the way I want 'em.
Which one is for the car?
Listen to music.
I get out.
That's good money.
As low as two.
What's your cost?
See what did I tell you?
Why does he want it?
Is that good enough?
Now is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
It's somewhere else and we can go get it.
My money's in that office right?
I know where to turn.
It's the next street.
I call your office she better answer the phone.
She's at your office.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Have her bring the money here.
She still is.
She was afraid.
She's been there since Thursday night.
You get used to it after a while.
Now tell me where my money's at.
In a way yes.
All I did was walk out with it.
You help her?
I'd like to hear that too.
Turn around and put your hands on your head.
She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
Well give it to me then.
She wants to give you your money.
You talk to her?
Long as at the end of that story she hands over my money.
She do that we're still friends.
You tell her that and I'll call you back.
You still there?
Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
I have the ten thousand you put up.
What's up with this shit.
Is that what I think it is?
If she had that shit -- and mind you I said ""if"" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Just listen for a second.
Man you know I'm good for it.
I'm telling you what I have to do.
Whatever you're into you seem to be getting away with it so more power to you.
Why would I tell you anything?
That's what the police thought.
Who says she does anything for me?
She's my friend.
When my friends get into trouble I like to help 'em out.
What does she do for you?
Do you know her last name?
Somebody already did.
She had I believe it was...
It still sounds high.
I got some more business for ya.
You go wait in the car.
That's the only name I know.
What's his full name?
You think you could do that?
He's been in before.
Ten thousand sounds high.
They have him up at county.
Who's it for?
I'll go through you.
What do you need me for?
It's in my bag.
You have it with you?
He works here.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think somebody's got some new clothes.
We're back.
You know it's for you.
Get that for me will ya baby?
Give me his home number.
He's around.
He leave town?
I want my boys!
I'm not dead!
I want my family!
That was years ago!
I've lived years since then.
There is no out of here.
I'm not dead.
Take me home.
Get me out of here.
Well how do I look?
Just to see you.
You want to see me?
Well here I am.
Do you want some help?
I can call upstairs.
I've tried.
Yeah ever since that...
What is it about us?
It's not funny.
you're already dead.
You see this line here?
It's your life line.
Here's where you were born.
I could have told you that.
They've done something to us.
How can you not want to know?
Who's been talking to you?
How can you just turn away?
What about the others?
It's just that war is war.
It's hard to explain.
Did he say anything?
You can still get a couple of hours.
Tell your mother.
It was the window.
What are you doing...
That's not true!
How can you believe that?
You've got to believe me.
I said I'd check it out and I did.
You're not telling me something.
You've got to do something.
Listen will you listen?
They're trying to get me.
Nobody's been talking to nobody.
And we need someone to cut through it.
We hear you're the man.
It'd break your heart.
What'd he say that for?
What made him say that?
That was set.
But the paper...
I mean a car tried to run me over the other day.
He say what they looked like?
A couple of weeks I think.
Maybe that's the only way to get through.
I've seen them too.
Whatever happened happened.
No more rest.
You can do it.
Let's just give it a little try.
See if you can stand.
I've seen it.
Well I'll see what I can do about it.
I was in Hell.
That'd be a first.
Am I dead?
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself.
Mark my words.
Every time I see you.
I've been having them recently.
Anyone ever tell you that?
I had to get in there.
What did you do to me?
You should go back to her.
You're always on her mind.
That's about all she said.
Put your hand up.
She talk about the boys?
Now turn to your left.
She's like you that way.
Put your hand under your head.
Turn on your right side.
How about the other ""right?
What did she have to say?
Hell you think I am?
But I see them.
We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Nothing makes sense.
Please help me.
How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
You're the only one I can talk to.
Christ I know how it sounds.
I see them.
Are you writing...
I need to know about...
Oh that goes way back.
Middle of the war.
I'm with another woman now.
And how is your wife?
Are you in the service?
There's about an hour's wait.
I've been coming here for years.
I need to see him.
There's nothing here.
He knows me.
Look I need to see him.
I know where his room is.
Just give me a pass.
He's been here for years.
Is he new here?
It'll just take some time.
I am not dead.
She was good in bed though.
You remember you met her that time at the Christmas party.
I was living with her.
I was living with another woman...
You know who it was?
I'm not cold.
I had my son's picture in it.
It's the only one I had.
You know who I am.
How many times have you asked me that?
WHO ARE YOU?
Stop playing with yourself.
It's finished.
Where have they gone?
Where are the boys?
There's nothing more to say.
Where's West?
Where'd you go today?
You can have anything you want.
What'd you do that for?
Right off the street.
Hey what's wrong?
Who do you think you are?
Who takes care of you day and night?
Well I've had it.
Well leave then.
Go to Hell.
You're out of your fucking mind.
You've lived with me for two years.
I've got you now.
You transport me you know that?
You carry me away.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
What are you doing to me?
What're you...
I'm the only one left.
It's not right for you or me.
Things are too hot.
I'll send for you.
Ever since I was a little girl.
I never thought it would happen.
It's so hard to believe.
I tell you it was so wonderful.
I felt like a little boy.
Are you out of your mind?
How do you expect to pay for this?
I was right.
He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Tell him what?
I'm not here.
It might be for me.
I can do anything I want.
Watch the fucking news!
You tell me!
It's just me.
Baby I'm sorry.
I feel terrible.
I'd stay and talk but I'm so late.
We'll talk when I get home.
That's all he said.
It'll be ready at a quarter of.
to explain what they did...
Maybe it'd clear things up in my head.
I thought they were real.
That's what I want to know.
Keep it in mind.
Love me a little?
You know you really ought to get out today.
It's not good for your mind.
You think I care?
One of us should be having a good time.
Anybody in there?
You just rest.
Even the dead one.
Am I home?
Get in there.
That's your decision.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not getting in there.
Get in here.
He's coming right over.
What'd the doctor say?
Get your clothes off!
Get your clothes off.
How high is that?
It's gone to the top.
A hundred and two?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Hey, I'm here.
Bring her here?
Oh, come on.
It's early.
Happens all the time.
That's all they are.
That's all it is.
What does that have to do with anything?
Even if you never say a word about it.
When was the last time I said a word?
Why do you bring her up?
Things like that.
Or your wife.
I was looking forward to it.
I just want to look...
Is that the one who died?
Not to me.
She looked good then.
Look at her face.
What do you mean you can see?
Why you left.
I can see what you mean.
Look at these, will ya?
Look, here's my Dad...
What's in here?
I must have been out of my head.
And look what I got.
Yeah but for what?
That's what you told me.
The little one.
Where'd you leave 'em?
What could I say?
It is tomorrow.
How come you're so late?
I was happy the way it was.
Save the words...
Take this too.
It's got my phone everything.
Call if you need me...
It's on me.
Well that's good to know.
You were there.
I told you they'd be gone.
It's strong stuff.
It'll free your head.
Hey, I'm not the problem.
You've got bigger problems than me.
You come here often?
So why tell me now?
Five hundred men died out there.
I knew they meant business.
That's why I had to follow you.
I can still see them coming.
A couple of days later.
None of us can remember that night.
And you did, too.
Like it was yesterday.
Hell, you remember.
That's what they called it.
And we did it.
Not the street stuff mind you.
I told you you'd know me.
If you're lucky.
I'll take the other one.
Well it's good to have you back.
See you tomorrow, probably.
I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?
That's what I'd like to know.
That's why I'm asking.
Bring 'em to the back room.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
I no from around here.
Look, I'm asking a simple question.
Clear the area.
This is an order!
Give yourself up.
What else could it be?
This is my life.
They were as real as you are!
My family was here.
She was here...
Drink some of this.
We're doing everything we can.
I'll page him.
You come home with me.
I've seen 'em take people right off the street.
I used to go home a different way every night.
Since that night.
What happened that night?
What is it Paul?
What's happening to me?
I had no idea.
I thought I was the only one.
You've seen them?
I've seen them too...
Paul, I know what you're talking about.
It's okay, Paul.
That's as straight as I can put it.
You in trouble?
Just watch 'em.
That black car?
Hey, take a look behind us.
I just need to talk.
You and everybody else.
God I hate this area.
It's not worth it.
You'll never win.
You must have put on twenty pounds.
I need to see you.
I'd love to see you.
I've been sick.
What's happening in your life?
Do you want me to get someone?
How did it happen?
He's coming.
They're heavy.
On top of him?
Bring it in.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Oh, come on!
You got lucky.
I mean, look around.
Out of time!
We made it?
What are you doing?!!
Then break it!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Just make a break for the door.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Okay, you know , that's it for me.
You come up with that yourself?
Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
We thought you were...
He came for me, I had to run!
Where the hell were you?!!
Where have you been?!!
Let's move out!
What are you doing back?!!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
I'm not ready.
They're back here.
We're not supposed to do that.
Can you hear me?!
Better let me.
Hey, easy now.
And now we're all out of it.
It bought us some time.
Then what do we do?!
And it's not finished!
Bring 'em all.
Let's move!
Yeah, I got ya.
Let's move out girls.
Let them take a look at our friends.
She needs some time.
Fine, just stay out of my way.
That's exactly what we need to find out.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Did you even check?
You're a teacher.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
They're both dead.
That's what he does.
That's all he does.
And he is very good at it.
No, you're dead!
You're all dead!
Where the hell are you?!
Now get out of our way...
we've got a job to do!
On my watch!
that thing is out there, it's dead!
You got it!!!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Pull me in!
we thought you were too.
He's what happened.
Where is everybody?
yeah, having a great time, and you?
I think so, why?
Did you like it?
I think I had some when I was eight.
No I'm not okay!
It'll work.
Oh sure, all the time.
You ever space walked?
I'll fucking do it.
We're not so bad.
Well, we'd be dead without you.
They were all wrong.
Were you close to your father?
You thought I meant...
I thought you meant...
That's why I'm here.
It's better this way.
What if you miss?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
Maybe we should go with them.
I got no problem with that.
She just wants this thing dead!
Oh I like her a lot.
Will you stop doing that?!
That's really funny.
She needs a little time.
you know what to do.
I need about fifteen.
Call me if there are any changes.
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Well, do something!
I'll help you in.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
It's on the table where I left it!
What the hell are you doing?!
He's right behind us!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
We should hear her out!
Close the fucking door!
They'll make it.
Close the door before he gets us all.
Let her hang there.
GO, GO, GO!
We've got a situation here!
Just do as  you're told!
what the hell is.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA!
So what else is new?
She's lost it!
Let's just get out of here.
This is what it means right here.
What do we do?!!
I'll tell you where he is.
And look at me!
I missed you too.
I am now.
I'm so pleased.
Little good it did him.
I live for this shit.
It's just you and me, then.
Am I in there?
There he is!
I've shut down the until.
Alright, stand back.
He's coming with us!
Leave him behind!
Just stay out of the way.
Close the door!
The power's back up!
I just know.
what does he want?
When can you get them here?
Alright, I'm.
We just left old Earth.
You'll never believe what we found.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Get him out of there!
He did this.
Of course he is.
You're walking and talking.
That's right, now if you could...
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
WHERE IS HE?!
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
You brought me back.
Sure but what good will that do?
Can we get through these?
What have I done?!
He's dead!
Everyone's dead!
Old Earth is dead!
He's not a...
He a friend of yours?
Here --  Take him home.
-- Out of the water now!
See what your son did?
Cut my hand.
He's taken him!
Have you ever had one do this?
Where is he?!
What about us?
Did you get him in the head?
Radio in for help!
Had it taken off.
What's that one, there?
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
We stay out here until we find him.
Get some help?
I never saw one that big.
You got it?
And I want him...
I know who he is...
Try some of this.
I made it myself.
And dinner when you land.
We'll meet your price.
Did you bring a check?
What'll I tell the kids?
I'll see you back soon.
You want to come?
How come you have to tell them that?
I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday.
He's sitting in it.
Love a cup of tea.
Can you stand something to eat?
Bring my cup back.
What was I before?
I used to wear this to the Garden.
You want to go through those?
This is the third one!
Do you see the kids?
This is summer.
You do the right thing.
Whatever it costs.
This summer's had it.
Next summer's had it.
He lost it on the way up.
Who's that young man?
Sure he is.
That's real good.
But they got him!
I'll get to that in a minute.
Do I need any more authority?
No, it's Tuesday, I think.
What day is this?
You think we can get back with those?
This is quite a place.
I hope we get some more help.
Look at that!
I knew it...
There's something I've got to find out.
They must've hit something.
An extra boat?
I want to check something.
Hold my feet.
It is a job.
It's my life!
Or do you have a job?
I Bought it.
Where'd you get all this?
What is all this stuff?
They can sense it miles away.
It's a good time, too.
They eat anything.
There's nothing here...
How can you tell?
Just as I thought.
About half of them.
Let's all have a drink.
How was your day...?
-- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
May I have a drink of water?
There's five of us.
Some friends and me took a house.
You here for the summer?
You from around here?
Oh, no, sir.
I've never had a woman do that.
Think she might've run out on you?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
We never had any.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far.
Look, I've got to talk to her.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
What else could've done that?
We're not even sure what it was.
Let him do it!
Go-go-go-go-go!
Look at him take it!
It's only two-thirty.
Will you live on the boat?
I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Is that a boat?
Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Is anyone having this...?
Would you like something?
So would I.
If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
We'll be back soon.
Everything's fine.
is everything all right?
He's busy.
I just wanted to know if you were all right...
Take my car, okay?
If I can hit him.
He's under!
Coming right to us!
And I'll drink to yours.
Ever see one like this?
This love line here...
I'm okay...
Now get down here!
Aye, Aye SIR.
What do you thing?
He was born with what he does best.
Next time, ask me.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
I'll see ya.
If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Let me see your hands...
Are you now.
I'm talking about a Great White.
I'm talking about working for a living.
A Great White.
Did anyone see it?
She's in a sick, terrible state.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
You know how I feel about her.
You are always trying to keep it real.
I'm in love with how you feel.
Can we make out now?
That's all I need from you.
That's more than I could ever ask for.
You actually look at my face.
I try really hard actually...
No for real.
What you mean as friends?
Also I think I'm in love with you.
You know it's okay.
You know I've been thinking.
What's another ten pounds?
Wait let me take that.
Oh my God SHUT UP!
That's not how our thing works!
She just looks like that all the time.
Yeah I did ask her if she wanted to go.
I totally heard you did.
Well we were once.
You know that time.
Were we together?
We could get back together too.
Well I do.
I think you're beautiful.
Is that normal?
What are they like?
I miss it too.
I just wanted to come over.
You definitely bring something to the table.
I mean do what you think is right.
So what do you think we should do?
I'm supposed to be running.
You're a real man now.
Did you hear it's yours?
Wait what's that supposed to mean?
Well there we have it.
Anything but this.
Oh God yeah.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
No I mean the father!
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse?
I know enough.
You could have sent it to them.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff.
A couple of hours?
Well I was just asking.
Close it up.
The way people used to do it.
First off how far along are you?
Are very cold?
I told you nothing happened!
Not from you and not from any man.
You never listen.
I'm sixteen.
God you're so young.
If you love someone once you can love them again I know it.
You're just not trying.
this is what my life has become.
But you're old!
Believe me on this one!
It's just not working out but I'm getting my own place in the city...
It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
That's almost interesting Mark.
I actually know this one.
Is this the baby's room?
It's beautiful!
Come on I have something for you.
Go learn something.
I sort of like it.
What the big deal?
Shit you better get out of here.
You're something else.
I want to have it.
She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean.
Well sort of.
It is God.
Hey I like this.
Hope you're ready.
it's parts...
Well it can really only go two ways.
The doctor can tell but I decided not to know.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
No he's the dad.
I wrote that.
They're not bad.
No she's working late tonight.
What do you play?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
I was just getting something.
Well I just have the baby and give it to you right?
Well it was nice seeing you.
I heard that was you.
Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Oh my God -- It moved!
I felt it!
You might want to head home.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up.
For you know the baby.
I want everything to be just right.
Yeah it kind of does.
This is the baby.
It's the right size and everything.
Is the baby okay?
I went to the doctor today.
Look if I could give it to you now I would.
Go up then turn left and on your right...
Well you're lucky it's not you.
What would everyone like?
Your name please?
I'm here for the big show?
I sort of already have.
It's not easy that's for sure.
Dad it's not about that.
Please stop now.
Are you having boy trouble?
Yeah like people in love.
Yeah she does.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Yeah well there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
He was very good in...
No no I'm definitely not asking for anything.
Like it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Minus or plus?
Well it's not.
Back for another test?
She seems so nice and all.
We're best friends.
He did it with you.
He's a man now.
Oh it totally does.
He asked her.
Well, you are kind of...
How many months has it been now?
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
She's pretty.
That's her.
Or stage parents!
It's like it's not even real.
Check out Baby Big-Head.
Best to just tell them, man.
Look at this one.
They already have three kids!
All right, how about this one?
But I'm trying to not be too particular.
No I heard you.
You're not listening to me.
Anyway I got to thinking on the way over.
I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
You love him.
That is sick man.
Eh I'll call them myself.
Want me to call for you?
Is this for real?
Like for real for real?
It's not a food baby.
Maybe it's just a food baby.
Did you have a big lunch?
What do you make with that?
What's that thing?
Well I was born to be a mother.
Some of us are.
Have you found a place to stay?
Looks like it yeah.
No it's fine.
There's just things I still want to do.
What would be a good time for you?
Of course we're ready.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I've just been thinking.
It's just part of the whole process.
Can you see it?
Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
You should read the book.
Or you could just wait a couple months.
They can live for two even three hundred years.
I suppose anything's possible.
I wish she'd call me just once.
are you serious?
Boy I'll tell ya if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
No it is not!
Took 'em all.
You took this picture?
Can I see 'em?
Could I try that?
How'd you meet Early?
Hey you're good.
Thought you said you never played before?
Is it hard to learn?
Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off...
I said I like your hair.
I changed my mind Early.
I'm the one got hit.
What's wrong with her?
it was for...
Thank you for what?
Yeah but what is it?
It was the only place open.
What the hell is this stuff?
Early can we stop there...
just for a little while.
As many times as it takes.
Yeah I left him with the car...
I read once...
What'll we do out there?
for one thing...
Wish I did.
You sure you have to?
What's your name boy?
Well let's put it this way.
I need me a new woman.
You two been busy in here.
and brought them back here.
Up until a few years back.
what happened here?
No it's all yours.
It's on me...
you go on an' have it.
how much money have you got?
Until someone stopped him.
Now why is that?
Spent years moving on from one place to another.
This the book your writing?
So what do you do Early?
Well it's like this Mr.
If I can...
Then try again
I tried talking to her at the mine.
She looks up to you she'll listen to you.
just shut up!
Why what did he do?
There's a big difference.
There's more...
She told me...
And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them.
Feel sorry for him?
Hey I got some great stuff...
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Funny very funny.
Who said anything about a still?
I still think we should have met them first.
I'd just about given up on you.
I think there's a book here.
and I think I know why.
I think it's the best stuff I've done.
and I started writing.
point it West...
just like that?
Then you can write anywhere.
Let's get out of here while we still can.
I love it when you talk like that.
Just being there where it really happened.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
You were plenty hot.
I know you better than you think...
Everybody just shut up!
Early just think...
You ever get like that?
It's the people he let come into the world...
lot of them should have been stopped at the door.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early.
Without his car?
Where would we find him?
Right I talked to you on the phone.
Three I believe.
But I'm not sure.
With how many people?
Wait maybe it was three.
I'd say eight maybe nine.
How old you?
Hold up man.
Let's be out.
Fifteen for me.
Fifteen is good.
How much do you want?
You never know when you can end up like that.
You give them money.
That's just it.
Did you look at that guy?
Why you give money.
Why I do what?
I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
You like her?
Man this guy is really good.
Girls love it.
I hate this game.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
But that's the thing.
Can I do it?
I imagine I can make her do anything.
Can you do it man?
No I'm serious man.
Where they lived the other's life for a day.
The way I see it.
You were the one.
No one else can ever do it.
It's no big deal right?
It is right.
That's too easy.
That's so easy.
I'm sure he's got food.
Get another forty.
She was pretty into it.
But I mean more like.
Just to see what would happen.
It's like all I think about now.
And I looked at her and thought to myself Oh my god this girl is a baby.
And she goes yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago.
You know what else?
Oh man that's the best.
Hell's yeah.
But then when she got into it.
She really got into it.
It was good.
I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in.
Did what take?
How long did it take?
Oh my god so good.
Well how was it?
I sat out here for like two hours!
That girl was like twelve and you hit it up!
He's doing fine.
Long time no see.
Do it again.
I just never seen girls that did that shit before.
But I think it looks nice.
You on the list?
Where you at?
Just forget it.
You know what I'm saying?
Do you care about me?
I'm telling you I just want to make you happy.
There's nothing in the world to worry about.
I know you'll love it.
I like you so much.
I just like you.
It'll be nice.
His parents are away.
I can understand that.
I'm not seeing anybody.
After I saw you last week.
Is it cold?
I've never seen any of them before.
What's all this?
I want to make you happy.
I just think that you would love it.
You think I want a baby?
What do I want to do?
You know what I want to do?
You know what you do then?
I remember when I was a little boy.
And look at me now.
But you should make yourself happy.
Now that's it.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No not everything?
It's a beautiful day out.
Everything is wrong.
That's life.
No one does.
A bad day!
Yeah well it's been a bad day.
I mean you're a very beautiful young lady.
It was just that I was looking at you.
Help make you happy.
Do you want to come make out with me?
This is Paul.
I only did it once and...
We'll work it out.
And it's like.
And you're not getting anything out of it.
Do you know where he went?
Speaking of stupid shit.
I'll ask you one last time.
I no understand you.
I was like yes!
Has that ever happened to you?
It's like yeah whatever.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
I can only take it up to fifteen minutes.
Fifteen minutes to a half an hour.
What the hell happened?!
You know what it's like.
Making love is like.
You know it's not like...
That's the best way.
He works for the post office.
That's all true?
That's horrible.
He had a hard life.
I hate 'em.
He still does.
If I had it maybe.
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
That's the whole thing.
You know if you look at it.
No one I know has ever died from that shit.
So how many people live here now?
We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Until you eat something.
And it takes them either too long or too short to come.
But that shit was nice and hard.
Oh my God that shit was so good!
It was like hard...
Come on man.
Get off me!
Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.
Otherwise back off.
I'm positive.
Then what's he talking about?
He's not talking about himself.
You got it on the board.
With my old man.
Of course it was.
You know I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.
You think I'm right?
Maybe you should.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
Not what -- who.
Look at the next line.
""Her God has gone and left his home.
He says it's a game.
What do you mean no?
Oh we'll be back.
You can bet on it.
Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
That's what kind of problem.
What kind of problem?
We seem to have a little problem here?
People have a lot of free time.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were...
What's the first street?
You know give him something to do.
It'll take hours.
You want me to what?
I want to talk to him.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this.
Yeah I am.
I think he's playing us.
You still having a problem with this?
Check with the State.
Run it down.
We'll find the evidence.
He was with me?
Where did you go!
But a hundred men could move him.
What do you mean stand out?
Did anyone stand out?
A few people.
Maybe there's two of them.
Who better to play a game with?
When you called you said she was in the other room.
I know where you are.
I'll give you anything you want.
I have been fair.
It's my move now.
""His play is always fair and just.
It is her I want.
It's me you want.
The game's over.
It's check Peter.
Who would you tell?
By that time the game will be over.
They think that you and I are doing this together.
What word did you leave last night?
It's you who's running out of time.
Just how close I'm getting?
The game's almost over Peter and you're running out of time.
What makes you think I was there?
Not that you're playing it very well.
It's something you learn to live with.
Then call them!
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
You're not playing very well.
I'm just trying to play the game.
Just like who?
I know what I said!
She looks just like...
Do you know what I'm doing right now Peter?
Her God has gone and left his home.
So her and I can meet.
If you got something to say to me just come out and say it!
You'll find her.
I did another one last night.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Did you know her?
You get one minute whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!
Are you ready to play?
I want to play a game with you.
I think your mother knows that now.
Put it down David.
I had to make it right.
I sat with them all.
I held their hands.
I was with them to the end.
My father left and my mother...
I know what happened.
You're mother's dead.
You can get into anything.
He died two years ago.
There's three.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
We're in.
stuff like that?
What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
He was watching you.
Why did he what?
Why did he?
He already did once.
We work together.
The police came to me for help.
What could I do?
You might not have done it had you known.
but I can tell.
A woman knows these things.
Did he say something?
Do you like my dad?
What do you like?
He should be right back.
Would you like come in?
Is your dad here?
What is it dad?
She also told me that Mr.
That has nothing to do with it.
What are you doing up?
How long she been dead?
Same as the others?
We'll check that out.
Not that I can see.
How long has she been dead?
I think she let him in.
We'll check in with you later.
Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
It was Peter.
Did you see his face?
You want to know what I think?
And what if he's wrong.
That I'm seeing what I want to see?
About a quarter to one.
What time did he get there?
Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
That's a big area to cover.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.
They're all the same type.
His home would be...
I was thinking the same thing.
He must be local.
It could have been a tape.
But we heard him.
I told him to.
I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
I'm busy right now.
What do you think he did?
What'd he do?
What's this all about anyway?
I told you this was a stupid idea.
Ten days ago.
How long ago was that?
Coming home at all hours of the night.
A young girl new to the city.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
It's over Peter.
Did you send the car?
What about the car?
Look I'll do anything you want!
That's why he wants me out of the way.
I went out.
That's got to be it.
What am I?
That's all he needs.
Okay it's a game.
He's white.
Maybe I already have.
What word did he leave?
We'll take it from here.
You want me to go with you?
Maybe I can help.
We've already met.
I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.
Please call me at home.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
Where did you go after that?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
To say hello to.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.
She went into town with Mrs.
Did they get him?
and you did this.
What do you see here?
Who says something's on my mind.
Whatever's on your mind.
Just thought you might want to talk.
You have something you want to say?
I want to be the best I can.
I've got be here for the police when they come.
We got a problem?
I suppose you have something in mind?
He knows you're aware of that.
What are they please?
Yes here it is.
Why they're all the same?
Could you look and tell me what they are?
We have the book.
I called you earlier about a book.
We'll call you back.
I can check and call you back.
Do we have a future?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
It's over now.
You made a difference.
I got lucky.
I'll be there later.
It could be anything.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
It's not that easy.
Then help me to understand.
I want to understand.
You're wife died.
Ever since my wife died I've been...
You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
I want someone I can get close to.
I was thinking that...
maybe when this is all over we could...
How could you even consider it?
I tried again and got through.
I thought you said the line was busy?
The line was busy.
I'll try again.
If I have to.
What do you want on it?
Call room service.
This is not just another game is it?
You've got to face the things you feel.
Then show me who you are.
You're cut off from everyone around you.
I'm just trying to get to know you Peter.
I'm not playing a game now.
You always want to talk about me.
I'm sure you are.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
How could you?
Unless you were there.
I know it was bad.
No -- I'm not involved.
You're not?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?
Let me ask you something?
Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
That's not fair!
So tell me about yourself.
Let's change the subject.
They just learn to control it.
Oh but it is.
That's a game.
Another kind of game?
I think it's interesting.
It could take hours before we know something.
You should try to eat.
She could be dead now.
She could be dead after the game.
I've got a game.
The one he wants to play the game with.
We need your help.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Well I think I've had enough.
Do you always open quickly?
That's a very personal question.
You like the control.
The strong win.
When I was very young.
When did you start playing?
You know how parents are?
Is this your first time here?
No I want you to do good.
You played an interesting game last night.
That's a better one.
I can feel the cold.
I knew you would come.
We are coming for you.
You have the power.
I will find you.
I will be with you.
Something's happening.
Thank you but I can wait.
I've found the husband I want.
Take off your clothes.
Well you're beautiful.
You're really not bad looking.
That's worse.
You will do as I tell you.
Through the door.
You'll both wait.
You must move quickly.
She's on the other side of this wall.
I can feel it!
To keep her from you.
You must never know her name.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
You are young.
She must agree of her own free will.
There is no other way.
You will know in good time.
I will find her!
Then we must be ready.
They will help us.
Never in the same place twice.
What did she answer?
Call to her.
There is nothing.
There's no way down.
Two or three days!
With two or three days' practice you'll be able to use it as well as I can.
In the old books.
Have you ever seen one of these?
They came once before a thousand years ago.
You must help me.
It is today.
It is today?
You have done it?
What will happen?
You will not then?
You do not know the price.
Even by you?
What else is left for a man without friends.
Better it was me.
Not yet my friend.
No more my lord - my friend.
I have need of friends.
when I called you a...
Once is enough thank you.
Which is right now.
A thousand miles off course.
What did he expect?
Where is this place?
It's what he died for.
Make for the wall.
If the pay is good.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go join them.
I saw terrible things.
Hand over your dinner.
These we'll pay for.
It will double our range.
I knew you would not be.
You will follow me.
My men follow no man but me and I follow no man at all.
Thank you no.
Now what do you have to give us?
And mine goes with you.
A small house.
What is that awful looking place?
May I eat with you tonight?
I'm with you boy.
We meant only to please you.
It's right behind you.
Where is it boy?
I only want one.
Why not wish for a hundred?
If I could wish...
You can have half.
What kind of a boy are you?
I must take the old man to see some sick children.
And do you think I live on air?
They need food.
What are you doing with my dear?
But also very young.
Oh now I've gone and done it.
If that were so you'd be dead now.
He will not come.
He will come for me.
He will not!
Power is none of these.
I do not want your power.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
That I am my lady.
We will hold.
What news from our friends?
We will have to try again.
Only ten of us made it back.
How many did you lose?
I lost thirty there.
We lost five.
Can you see?
It is the time.
It is the time then.
That is true.
It is too late.
It is not necessary.
They will not follow.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
She had another name once.
Her name is Death.
Perhaps she will help.
We'll find her.
Go now save the other.
You will come with me.
It will not help.
A young man about the age I was when I met you.
There is a girl there.
Why must you know?
When will it come near here?
Power you have given me.
What can my power give you?
The power to see.
You had left me!
You said nothing.
You told me nothing.
You had a son.
We had no children.
No she was not as beautiful.
She was not as beautiful.
But you would not stay with me.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
I was beautiful then.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
I heard he said...
That's all...
How do you know it?
But if you leave me his money I'll give him it myself.
Why do you want to know?
What's that man's name?
I love him.
But what's special in him?
""Yes I think""...
How she kids me!
Come on shit tell me!
Is he beautiful?
I was sure!
Come on tell me!
I know him?
I want to live my way.
Do you come back?
Can you believe it?!
Take them you never know...
Just to know...
And I never did anything with my money...
I should do something.
Do you need money?
That's what I later told myself!
It's better...
We'll go where you want!
Let me work.
We'll get out I tell you!
It will take them five minutes!
Getting far away the two of us for example...
Nothing for the moment.
May I ask you a personal question?
Three times then two times.
That night I left my country and came here to join my father who worked for Tony.
Then I never left the city...
That's awful.
You met anyway?
Before coming here in my country.
I'm used to this!
I feel it would go the wrong way.
I tried to get beautiful!
Like we played...
And I lost.
Poor darling and then?
I just get older.
Yeah I know!
But for the moment you're not yet a woman.
I need time...
And you too.
Come on I'm waiting!
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.
For the moment I have none of the two!
You still have a chance to get out.
There's a lot of things to do in life a lot of other jobs...
It's too big.
What about getting some friends?
There are better things.
Ten minutes early or late he'd have seen death.
We'd found him.
How old were you when you had your first contract?
I love you anyway.
When I say I love you.
Everyone is looking.
It's true...
Talking about other people's death is easy but what about yours?
She's here!
That's part of the job!
I'm ready now.
You said I learn very quickly.
How do you know it's love if you've never been in love before?...
or the love you can have with a brother or a father...
How can you know?
It's the first time for me...
I left nothing for you!
Where is the guy?
Come on get down!
Keep in front of the window.
There the guy...
It's like you put him away...
How did you do it?
Now try a running guy.
It's not serious it's just training.
Come on have a little training.
It's brilliant!
But can you miss the car?
What for example?
Not very sure.
You have one chance out of five to miss.
How can you say it?
Yeah but he's not exactly my father...
But what does your father exactly do for living?
I'm used to it.
How are you Miss?
And how much is it?
You're right son.
It's the only important thing in the world.
Why the hell did you come here?
What region do you come from?
And his name...
Every time we asked your help we were very happy with the result.
Why am I such an authority?
For a walk.
He probably just went somewhere.
I have to finish first.
I'm almost there.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
How serious is it?
You should definitely have children.
They're really special.
Are you two planning kids?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles...
If you really want to do this...
plan it out.
Train for it.
Build up your body.
Plan every stop along the way.
How much money?
Really do it properly.
It's what she asked for...
If I get any information I'll call you.
How long does this...
We're very sorry about that.
Or whatever it's called.
What would you like us to do?
Were you there to help her?
It's hard to say.
It can but it'll have to wait in line.
if someone like you had to I mean...
I've seen it before.
I know what you're getting at.
Yes -- you are.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
I think it's a different place for each person.
He's never been there for me.
That's okay -- really it is.
It'll make it.
It must've hit the window...
But you love me anyway.
You can change.
People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents...
My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.
You've just decided, is that right?
I want children.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
Please tell me.
But I want to take a walk with you.
Walk with me?
I do love you...
very, very much.
There's no reason.
You're talking to me?
What you have is a statement.
We can do it together.
If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Is this a special day?
There was no card.
You thought I sent them?
they're beautiful.
I want to.
I want to give her everything I can.
About my love for her.
It must have been difficult.
If I had seen you.
By the way I'm sorry about your wife.
What did they ask?
Out of the car.
Call me here.
Not our problem.
He could be somebody hot.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.
What's his story?
You know what -- that was a really good story...
Tell it again.
It came to the end of the game.
Who's telling this story?
You know what...
I'm not good at that.
Very bad in fact...
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I'm much older than three.
Are your parents home?
I'm three.
By car right?
Three thousand miles?...
How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
I'm getting to it.
that's it, what is it, talk to me.
This story is too big for this paper?
No more words.
it's all just words.
She knows you love her Mr.
She knows now.
To tell me you know what's best?
I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
What, come on?
Come on Mr.
Are they standing?
I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
From the heart is always better.
I missed you to Mr.
that comes to about three thousand miles...
that's a long ways away.
I'm really lost.
What does this have to do with walking?
What are you doing Mr.
Round The World In Eighty Days.
I'll see you when I get back.
Write from your heart.
Nothing ever happens.
You write about the wrong things.
How can you feel for dog food?
Never have children.
Sorry I was late.
Someone should be with you.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?
Did you do everything you could while he was here?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something...
You need to rest Mr.
It's for your own good.
It's a beautiful thing you did.
What do your friends call you?
Did you take me back?
In a hospital.
I told him not to go.
Forty-seven years.
I have four.
Oh, that's not mine.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I mean you've done a great thing.
I'm not sure what to do now.
I'm not sure what he wants for me.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.
It would mean a lot to me and my family.
Please take it.
I really want that watch.
Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
What do you think I should get?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
You know I love you...
you look so very sick...
I wanted to see you...
this is one thing you can do for me.
You can do this for me.
And do what...
I will not talk about that.
I've missed the best sun.
Let's stay for a while.
I like it here with you.
One of my friends was there.
Where was that house?
When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and...
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
You be careful to.
I'll be back home around three.
that I hope you are back when I get home.
Please be careful.
we already talked about that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
I'll give you that.
Can we just forget it?
I think you should wear one at a time.
One of these...
and one of your others.
That'll make me look different.
How can you be so good?
I sense that your trouble is very big...
and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do.
It has nothing to do with us.
but I'm sorry.
I asked you if you knew it was a hundred.
You said you did, so I let you do it.
How did you do that?
Oh, and what did you do?
but how did our evening go?
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
I'll be half an hour.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
We could go out and play for a few hours.
So what did you do with your clothes?
Whatever that means.
Thanks, I do understand.
but now I'm not.
but that seems to be all right with you.
What I'm saying is...
that I hope you understand that I understand.
I know that...
I think you're talking about you.
I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you...
I hope that you understand how I feel about this.
it's better for me that way.
I've come this far...
here I am, in your house.
Want a drink?
You can never...
I throw up all the time.
Now I feel really good...
That is what I want.
I want you here...
I've never done so much talking in my life.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here.
I'll go and sort it out today.
We'll find a real room for me.
Then please stay at my place.
Let's talk about tomorrow.
So I decided to just play my part.
Interesting choice of words.
I just know that I want to.
It's our first.
I'm just concerned.
or our last.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
I'm from the East.
I think of it as home.
I can deal with the bad things that happen.
But my life is good.
It is as I would want it to be.
If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner.
I really like you.
You make me want to talk...
My watch went the way of the car.
If you want to come home and wait.
I think you know I'm serious.
I'll pay you if you like...
but I'd like to see you.
Are you serious.
maybe we could have dinner.
I was looking for you tonight.
I sold it this morning.
If I was I'm sorry.
that should do it.
Yes, that's right.
No, I came here to drink...
There's time left.
You can have more money.
You can drink all you want.
You can talk or listen.
Just stay, that's all I want.
Maybe another drink first.
I'm having one.
Right, I'll get your door.
We can stay in the car for an hour if you want.
But I really have to go then.
It's your time.
No, this is fine.
not that I mind...
My room's not far.
You can drive with me if you want...
That's funny.
What do you mean, working?
I'm walking.
Are you working?
I'll find out though.
How much, do you think?
You need a new  one.
How'd this happen?
What did they look like?
you seem like a nice girl.
I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
What do you mean a date?
I've got a wife back home.
I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I thought you might be looking for a date.
My name's Paul.
Yes, that would be great.
About ready for another drink?
Stay at home.
I will call you tomorrow.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Like I said...
A full night on the street and this is all?
I need to buy many things...
all of it!
Yes, of course.
How much do you need?
With an old friend.
how you have moved up in the world.
We are both older.
I've been all right.
I need this!
But it's a top three school --
What're you so happy about?
I believe we are.
Are we done for today?
I'll take that as a no.
Were you with another man?
He was thirty-four years older than you.
Believe me the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
To me it is.
That's not what's important.
I'm sure of it.
I believe you!
I've already lost my husband.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Who could better understand than me?
He means well.
He's really brilliant and all.
Was there any evidence that Mrs.
Did she tell you that?
Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs.
Even though we all told her not to.
Two a year since I was twelve.
How many would you say?
Not that I saw.
Was your father there?
But you agreed last night.
In the office?
I'm a man who knows what I want.
So everything you just said --
I'm sorry but --
Is everything okay?
He's making it up.
Just the love in my heart.
She could never do something this awful.
I saw Mrs.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I think so...
Of course I can believe it.
I'm so happy for you!
I feel so bad for her.
God that felt great!
Go -- you can do this.
He has to see serious I am now.
I love him!
Is she as pretty as you?
Happens every day.
You're asking the wrong girl.
I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's ""I met someone else.
Well what am I supposed to do?
After you went to all that trouble?
I'm her sister.
Then we can win the case.
His father had to make a call.
He has it sent out.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I believe her too.
Our group is full.
I really want to do a good job.
Speaking of which can you please put on some party clothes?
It's a completely brilliant plan!
You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
We still love you.
Who the hell does he think he is?
Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
I think you should go with red.
Is he the only one?
Someone missed you.
So Friday at eight?
Are you asking me on a date?
Oh my God!!
What if you're trying to be something you are?
No more trying to be something I'm not.
So now you're --?
Sorry I brought it up.
What the hell is that for?
Okay how would it work?
And you know this for a fact?
She's not!
Maybe not to your face...
But maybe it is --
But maybe it's not what you think.
Thanks again for your help!
It gets better.
Who else do you have?
Did she do that to you too?
Yeah they tend to do that.
Like all the time?
What're you doing here?!
We miss you!
I just need to be by myself.
How could this happen?
No -- it's just -- not me.
Of course I do!
Maybe she found him like that.
She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
See you tomorrow!
I changed my mind.
Looks like I am.
It made me realize something.
You look -- nice.
You know how you get.
Well yeah but --
Now I am.
You're here now.
How was your summer?
Time for class.
Meet me after?
What like it's that hard?
You go where?
I go here.
You're not here to see me?
I need someone -- serious.
I have to think about my future.
And what people expect from me.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Let me take you home.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
I completely agree.
And I expect a lot from me.
I plan on running for office some day.
Law school is a completely different world.
I need to be serious.
Did you ever take Mrs.
Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Pull up next to him!
Let's go there!
Let's all go!
What's the thing that always makes us feel better no matter what?
why do that?
We come watch...
we come watch...
Why so few?
You go to lady now?
So you shall be...
To be strong and free...
I feel that too.
Or looked so beautiful...
I've never felt so strong or happy.
It's odd...
when I first found myself...
And I with you...
Now I wish only to be with you...
Might we watch too?
Indeed I am my dear...
that makes us a pair!
What will become of me then?
At the moment very little.
Your company at my table...
Do it now!
Why have you brought me here?
I am afraid of nothing.
are you not also afraid?
Only most are afraid to show it.
Not from me surely...
None know that better than I!
I like well what I see.
How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
What do you want with me?
No more listening!
An' how you do it?
Nothing the same.
Oh no never...
nothing like that...
What you do boy?
Who might these friends be?
You must find the ring...
That's it then...
It was lost.
And did you?
I'll do anything...
Listen to him.
You're on your own...
He's getting away!
Ah but you will.
Why should he do that?
The question is can we save ourselves?
Can you save her?
Do you hear what I'm saying?
One more turn...
There must be some way to get it up there.
Will you chance a miss?
We do both.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
but what choice have we?
we've little else to go by.
we've not made...
I should hope not!
Something the matter?
Nice piece of work.
Good plan that.
She be our eyes.
What did it say?
I'm small...
Want to see me do it?
Something's coming.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
You'll know it when you see it...
What's left of me...
Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.
And who might that be?
I know where to find it.
Play the part of a girl-child.
There must be an answer somewhere.
Course we care.
Then what's gone wrong?
Why did it happen?
Why has this happened to the world?
it's generally known that --
What does she want from me?
have you seen her by chance?
True to the mark.
I need to rest.
To be sure.
How're these?
Three at once!
No no no...
this is different!
And I love you my husband.
I am a Green Man.
you are to be my husband.
I want none other.
I meant every word.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.
I could never tell you...
where I join him...
it's not you he's afraid of it's...
he used you to save himself.
They told me you were dead.
it's better this way...
I thought you were dead...
Only what's right...
What if I answer yes?
Will my wish come true?
I have no wife.
He did run?
My own father...
It was so lovely...
like a baby...
Are you honest?
You have no right to order me about.
Let's rest a minute.
I may have said perhaps...
But you did...
If you like.
These for me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Far as you're concerned she's dead believe it or not.
Dead dead dead.
She's dead!
As fair as me?
Tell me one thing more.
Just who might you be?
What's this now?
Should be the other way round...
Long you for another?
And am I not fair?
In every way.
It's done...
Maybe there's a better idea...
All nature is living.
I know where to find him...
Oh but I have.
it be that close...
Let that be our problem just get us there.
That very nice.
Can you show us the way?
You do know where it is?
simple as death...
strong as hate...
Simple as that eh?
Is he a friend then?
oh no please sir...
I'm not looking!
When does George get to come see his house?
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
We can work.
There's not much to do there.
I mean it's all work.
You can go back to bed...
I thought I might stop by.
I love red!
I would have anyway.
Who are all these people?
What are you doing up so early?
I set it to see if it would work.
I put him to work.
What did you think it would be?
Did you feel anything?
for my back.
I want you to try something with me okay?
You have to ask like that?
I need to ask you something Mr.
I thought you said he was?
What's today?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Are you his friend?
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Where are you?!
He asked where you were!
He wants you with him.
Not if what he left me was real.
You hate your father.
Okay but then we'll just be friends.
I mean I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
I thought we were just friends.
You're off you know?
You're way way off.
Does everything have to have a point?
What's the point of this?
what do you mean?
Why are you so stupid?
I'm coming in.
I've seen lots of people.
It's not a big thing for me.
This is serious!
His parents took his car.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I'll get your back.
I might not stay anyway.
You look better without make-up.
Where's your dad?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.
Where's my dinner?
Who's in trouble now?
Will he talk to me?
He's not the type to worry.
He's at work while I'm here.
Just I mean well you're here every single day.
His dad on the other hand was the real deal.
George just never really...
I knew you were doing that by the way.
That's why I stopped doing it with you.
Listen to music?
Talk on the phone?
You've been good this week.
That would take weeks.
Well if it is we have a problem.
It's thirty feet.
If that's what it takes.
I hate to ask about a window.
I would miss that too much.
Just run it by me first just in case you know...
but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Twenty years of my life.
Only the ones that really mean something to me.
What can I do for you George?
Well I feel better about this now.
From the day I started...
You love your job.
I hate this job.
maybe I can get you a year.
Class of eighty-six!
We were probably in school together.
That's too long.
Maybe that's too long.
I've been here twenty years.
Whether we want to or not.
Well that's sort of...
what was he?
How's your wife?
how much weight have you lost?
What are you on?
I'm good thanks.
We're getting out of the ground today.
You're here early today.
Thanks I'd like that.
I want you both to stay.
do you know when she'll be home?
She's out with a friend.
I want you in me now!
You'll have to explain that to the police.
George this is the third time.
This has got to stop!
There is no fucking deal.
I know what the deal is.
I'm not stupid.
I never said anything.
I'll ask.
The whole summer man.
I never tried to get you to like me.
I tried to get you to love me.
Having me here?
Trying to get me to like you.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.
Maybe everything happens for a reason.
Are you taking them still?
What's wrong with your back?
that Peter left.
You look better than ever.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
Everything would have been better if you had.
And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.
But we never talked about it.
Are you talking?
If I asked you to stop would you?
What would you be doing now?
I gave up on you.
I'm telling you now.
I wish you had told me then.
He wanted you to have his last name...
I let him even take that.
He's got nothing to do with me.
What do you know about me?
I know parts of who you are.
See that's the thing...
I am what I say I am.
What are you now?
What I'm not.
What would you like to be?
How do you become something you're not?
Do whatever you want with it.
All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
what you are.
You know that great thing though?
It happened to me.
I'm not even listening.
I want you to be happy.
Not here with me.
Not home with your mother.
I see it in your eyes.
In your answer to everything.
I'll have to pay him back.
I never won the game.
My dad used to play a game.
Oh so you're in the big shit now!
Sit down for a second.
You're too fucking late.
Today I give a shit.
I've been using since I was twelve!
A friend of yours is here.
You'll have money when you work for it.
It'll be fine.
I'm not doing it!
I want you here.
You'll have money when you work.
I need some money.
Can I take you out?
What are you doing?!
If you hit me I'll call the police.
And there's no make-up at my house.
You have everything?
I'll get your bag.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Who are you anyway?
Why would you be there?
I'll be around to check up on you.
To check up on me?
But not by people who want to.
Can you build a house in four months?
No one's really said four months is all you have have they?
What kind of house?
I'd build a house.
What would you do?
I want you to find someone for me.
It's my day off.
Why would he leave?
Thanks for telling me.
Do you know what I'd give to have this!
Forget how I got it!
Left you this place.
I better get the kids home.
Peter left me yesterday.
I kept thinking about it what you said...
You need to know what?
Do I still love you?
Let's not do this okay?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.
You've never said that before.
That thing about I was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known.
When I picked you up from the train station...
what you said.
I'd rather you not be here.
He's not there!
I'll stop coming.
What is it with this?
He has no time!
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I know they're not much help but they love coming here George.
Oh I'm worse.
Much much worse.
It's been a while.
Do you need help?
You're a good mother.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.
They really wanted to come.
I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.
You brought your kids?
No I'm...
I took something.
My stupid back.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
It's what I believe George.
It was so real.
We have it on video!
Was that when?
Do you remember?
It was simple whatever it was.
Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.
What have you been before today?
That I'm happy today.
The first and the last.
I was here six years.
I used to live here.
Well for later then.
We're fine.
He can hate me.
You can hate me.
You can call the police.
He's sixteen.
I did say he could go.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I want him with me.
Forget it really.
One of you would end up dead.
I need help.
Not for the weekend.
For the summer.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
God I hate the thought of him home all day.
When's school over?
Where will you live?
You've been saying that for twenty years.
Why call me?
What did you do with your dog?
I left to think.
Where have you been for a week?!
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
You could be dead!
Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?
Where he always is.
I could use the money.
You can tell him not to even look at you if you want.
She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I'm there.
You got the money?
It'll take you like twenty thirty minutes.
Then you tell me what just happened?
Everything happens for a reason.
That's what my dad said.
I'm sixteen years old.
I feel in love with George again.
That was my plan...
I'll be in the bedroom.
Where are the kids?
I never asked for more.
What are you doing home?
I'm working at something too.
I'm even talking.
Do you want to be around for it?
I want to be around for that.
What difference does a few months make?
That was the plan.
I mean he really is.
After the kids are back in school.
I'd be you.
If I let everything that should worry me worry me I'd be dead from worry.
It would worry me.
I'll make you something.
His father is a man.
I wish you'd talk to him.
He needs a man.
Do you like red?
Either do you.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...
useful in court.
Do you know anything about building a house?
It's not ours.
It's George's.
You got a dog?
Maybe it's what I want.
I read the letter.
You read the will.
He wants you to keep it.
To live in it some day.
This is what he wants.
You're sure about this?
Depends on what I'd give up on.
Can you stay for dinner?
What are you doing in my room?
Dad's home already?
Someone stop her!
I brought a few of my own.
Can we really help build a house?
Not all day.
I'll be home after lunch.
All day again?
I just thought it would be nice.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Dad said it first.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Better make it a week.
It's a boy!
Well let's get a look at him.
And the baby?
She's doing just fine.
She'll be fine.
I sure know I would.
It's a different world now.
Hell with him.
Thought you'd never ask.
I'd like to help you...
I mentioned you.
I mentioned you both.
What can you do?
I got him a pardon.
There are ways around that.
Why you interested?
Can I talk to him?
That's him over there.
I look good tonight.
And I feel lucky too.
Well alright then.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is.
Then what's the problem?
Want me to come back some other time?
I'm too old for you.
Take care of me?
Anyway she wanted me to take care of you.
But I'm not on the outside.
I'm in here.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Real nice guy too.
Oh she's fine.
She's just not coming today.
You look just like she said.
Over forty years now.
What do you think of this place?
We need a special man for this job.
She came all the way down from New York.
I got it...
Well that's nice real nice.
I'll be back soon enough.
Everything will get back to normal again.
Of course I did.
But I'm having a good time...
What's wrong baby?
Here's to your new job down at the bank.
I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Why would you want to go home?
It's so early.
But I need it to get home.
That's my name.
That's never happened before.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
I've never seen you in here before.
I know you're not talking to me...
Hell with you then.
Is that so hard to believe?
More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
It's almost as old as we are.
Then before I could figure out what to do with it it was gone.
And that was you Mr.
I can deal with this.
We'd be half way to New York by now.
You sure it was him?
Forget about that.
You run if you want to but you're not taking this car.
And what will we do when we get there?
We have the chance right here right now I say we go!
Then you're lucky I came along.
Where you taking him?
I'm not working on a plan.
I like to talk too.
That was five years ago.
I'd have taken that deal.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
That's the way it is.
Well if that's the way it is...
We never were friends.
Lots of people do it.
The man needs to explain himself.
Let's see what you can do.
You want to hit?
There he goes right there.
Now shut up the game's about to start.
Give me back that hot dog.
I'll eat it myself.
They must be the right people.
Let's get a couple.
I know people.
He's my boy.
Hundred and Sixty First Street?
Hundred and Sixty First Street.
The hell you talking about?
That's right we'll get off at the next stop.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Hell you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
New York's a long way's off.
Let's just keep moving okay?
You did it man!
You got us out!
Next stop New York City!
You know I hate it when you call me that.
Does that mean I'm in?
So now you want to be my friend?
Well let's just think about that for a moment.
What happened to we?
Did I hear you say we?
I think we can make it.
Sure wish I could have met him --
What do I want?
What makes you think I want something?
Sure is hot today.
If you've got a plan I think I have a right to know about it.
I told you my plan.
Believe you me I'm getting out of here.
Why are you always talking about we?
There is no we.
There is a me there is a you.
But there is no we between us.
I think we can do this.
They got a boat there.
Yeah I know what your saying.
What about you Radio?
What a second you've been in here since you were thirteen?
He does it all by himself.
What do you know anyway?
What's life mean?
There's no way I can do life.
I got a job starts Monday morning!
How long is life?
Hell with him then.
My daddy's watch.
Oh man I've never seen a dead body before!
That's better than money.
He even got my daddy's watch.
You lost all our money in a card game?
See I met this girl.
Real nice girl.
I've been looking for you.
I want to be one of them.
I want you to be one of them.
It worked out.
What gave you that idea?
Nice meeting you?
"" That's a good question.
When there is you can forget about it.
This watch means the world to me.
My daddy gave me this watch.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future.
I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
And you're always on the road.
Get you every time.
No tell me what's so funny.
That's some long green.
Start your job?
I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
What do you mean like cut it off?
Where they taking us anyway?
How could I forget that?
You've got to remember me.
We went to high school together.
Like a lady's.
You ever done time before?
Well not yet.
What's there anyway?
You heard what the man said!
Alright listen up!
Let's move it!
Move it out.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones.
How long these boys in for?
They'll find we do things different down here.
He's from New York City.
That one too.
You got that?!
Where am I at man?
He's a good friend of mine.
Oh no my friend.
Come on let's get this over with.
What do you think about that?
That's a terrible story.
Hell of a way to get out.
Nothing to it really.
Sixty-five years ago.
That's like that's like...
I gave you life.
I believe that.
He gave up hope.
I always said I'd never end up like this.
I thought I'd make something of myself do something with my life.
Have a big house a family.
You need it more than I do.
I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
You still have your daddy's watch?
Well this is all I can give you.
I wish it was more.
These are some of my friends.
He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here.
He'd do the same for me.
You'll never make it!
It'll be too late.
He must still be in there.
Is everyone here?
That'll be all for tonight.
I just want to hear you say it.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me.
It meant the world to me.
Something like that yes.
Must have been some time ago.
Maybe forty years?
Mind if I ask where you got it?
Yeah it's special.
That's a real nice watch you got there sir.
Yeah it's getting late.
Anybody else need anything read?
Apparently your sister died.
You should have come by last night Radio.
Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
That's where the real action is.
They run but they never get too far.
You all been here a long time.
That's a long story...
Maybe we will.
Man that music is hot.
You found him.
I'm interested.
I can get more.
A lot more.
See for yourself.
You remember how it was when you were starting out.
But you do.
What does that say about me?
Is Dad okay?
It's so nice to see all of you here.
I hear a train coming.
Of course I can.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
He's sick?
Dad's sick.
Please get out of my mind!
Let me out.
Why should it end?
I never want it to end.
It's our time brother.
What do you think about...
That's what I thought!
Yeah get out of here!
And he's dead serious.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Come on out and say hello...
I read that...
Sure why not?
Can we keep it or what?
I would totally love to go there.
But I hear it's really hard to get in.
Show him Central Park.
I'll call her later.
Try four and a half.
You're already there...
It would be so okay.
I'm not a hundred percent on that.
God said when the time comes you'll know what to do.
But how can I win?
Yeah you do...
She's so nice.
How did you see me?
yes he's here with me now...
I'll call you back...
Where did you meet my father?
How come you're not older?
what did she look like?
Okay can I just ask you something?
He'll be here.
He's late.
Did you just talk?
I think you're looking at him.
I've got to find him.
You were really high.
Maybe you love her.
What can I do about it?
Look it's okay for me to shit the street.
And it happens every day?
You'll be alright.
Big day tomorrow.
From now on.
It sure is.
Now eat it up.
I'm an old friend of your father's.
He's asked me to help you out.
You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr.
You save your father!
Put it back on my head.
Check one-two.
No, no, that's not what I said.
I will, Dad.
Listen, I got down low.
You take care of the middle.
I'm still in love with you.
Do you have any advice at all for me?
That's a train, son.
Son, just do your best.
So go get 'em, Dad!
I was just playing with you.
Now that was an experience.
Now everybody sit down.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
What was it called sir.
You got it in you.
I've never been to Earth.
You're not saying it's up to me?
Nothing's getting through that.
By she do you mean he?
And she needed that.
You sure you're down with this?
Look who's back from the dead.
What's with that guy?
There's our man.
One more time.
Which way did he go?
Let us in.
I'm not home!
You got to.
You got the wrong window again man.
From my dad's side of the family.
Okay I do.
Get back up here.
And I love my Dad very much.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Are you dead?
What were you thinking coming here?
Stay right there.
I meant to say that...
You know what's nice about you?
You just seem happy being yourself.
I was concerned.
I'd love to have a dog.
But I go to school full time.
You have a dog?
My dog knows though.
So what part of the city do you live in?
It's not that cold.
Thanks so much.
Do you miss her?
A black guy?
It looks like the work of a brother...
Why is that funny?
You from the South?
Okay now you gone and done it.
See something you like, my man?
Nothing will happen!
Your days are running out.
How long can you last?
What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
No, for you!
I feel sorry for you, boy!
They said I'd never get him...
but I cut him up good, I did.
And then it stopped coming and they...
And you're ready.
What other food?
the same as the other food...
The other food stopped coming and they started.
How did they get in here?
How do you want us?
It'll be all right...
Imagine, a pair.
There must be somebody else up here.
Do you know how long all this will last?
Not thirty years...
or thirty thousand years...
but thirty thousand years...
and you'll be part of it.
And you'll be here...
You're a beautiful pair.
Where do you send them?
Never a pair.
I have never had a pair.
I know you do!
You have to help us!
Where do we go?!
Where do we go from here??!!
We were sent here and you know it.
Others have been sent here.
Where do you think we came from?
You walked in.
I saw you.
How do you think we got here??!!
Anything to eat?
All right -- what are you?
and better than either.
Just get it over with.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You're in good hands, believe me.
Just the face.
What'll it be...
a face job or a full-body job?
And I did it myself right on there.
Your own work?
I thought you'd be older.
Why did you do that???!!!
They've made us believe that...
Why did you do that??!!
What are you talking about?!
It has nothing to do with you.
I'm fine...
you need it...
more than I do.
Anybody we know?
What the hell took you so long?
You're already beautiful.
Only a few?
There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
You missed something special.
Well why not!?
That's exactly how everything works.
""One for one.
One for one.
Whatever happens you can bet it's final.
But who would want to find out?
Not in my time...
Maybe maybe not.
So now you've seen him...
Turn this way.
You are here.
He was after you.
You're running!
The other one came after.
The older one.
Remember the one who came after --
He's the one.
Just a face job.
He's running.
Tell them the rest!
It's him!
I never go upstairs.
You're a nice old lady.
When do you go up?
What does that water do?
But nothing less either...
Can we be that way?
listen to me...
you know that!
have a life as long as his...
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything!
What can we possibly give him?
You're wrong!!
It has to be!!
It Just has to be!!
Just the hope.
There has to be!
It has to!!
You want there to be one...
One in a million I suppose
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
It could be...
Look at his face...
and his hair...
What can all that mean?
They all have names and numbers on them.
I wonder what they are?
I have never seen a face like that before.
It must be the look of great age.
Then the answer's yes...
But I still have the choice...?
You can have any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
You're right...
it must be near now.
How would anyone know?
Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
We know we can eat these.
We'll be all right...
I hate outside!
I hate it!
It makes everything move.
Your hair is moving.
I know I felt something I never felt before...
I'll tell you one thing...
That's the last place for me to live now.
I wanted to...
I'm afraid.
to eat of course.
What do you suppose this was...?
It's the only way.
How do we know this is the right way?
You're still a green.
Will you take me with you?
They're watching us now.
They'll let us in when they're sure.
How will they know we're coming?
Now to the right.
There's no other way for me
or one of the others.
You know there's only one place to go now...
Why do you keep running from your --
Are you taking me to them?
Not that either.
That's nothing...
Take me to them.
Maybe me too now...
Can you take me there?
But what is this -- why?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Let's see -- how long has it been?
I'm only telling you what I've heard...
I'd rather be with you.
Maybe she'll help me.
If you did know you'd tell me.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I wish I could help you.
That's tomorrow.
Are you here to help me?
I let him go...
How can I?
It's different now.
I know what everyone knows.
You have the same chance everyone else has.
running's what I'm interested in.
You know something.
Why tell me?
Why show me?
There has to be more.
Then it's still no.
but I have the choice.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen I suppose?
Shall I come in?
You could have called me yourself.
You're years away...
Want to try?
I go red next year.
that's where I come in.
Do what everyone does.
But what if you want to live?
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm afraid to tell you.
Not about that.
I thought I had to do something.
Who brought you?
Why do you use that word?
Now he's gone.
You mean ""not here"" -- that's it?
You're a private Available but particular.
There's no one here but me.
What's wrong Available?
Come with us.
We'll remember.
But that's a long time off...
but it does.
Mother and Father said so...
Yes indeed everyone.
Actually they all have three.
That's two.
But there are so many of them.
What else could they be?
Of course each one has his own name too.
I like your face.
I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
Where's the doctor?
I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Can you make it back?
I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
They lived together all their years?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife.
Tell me -- what do those words mean?
We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Is that really it?
Will we be there soon?
Are you ready to put him in?
Of course you can stay.
May we stay here for a while?
We'd like to rest.
Never never ever.
No no no
No -- I'm sorry.
It's not possible.
May I have one too please?
they're dead...
You knew your mother and father?
My parents thought so.
Mother and Father.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
I have always been here...
Just a place I suppose...
What kind of place is this?
For as long as I can remember.
How long have you been living here?
Take her back.
Go on back.
Someone will follow.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I'd like to thank someone.
Can you do it?
No -- just there -- on the first level.
We'll see you.
Okay wait for me.
Too much you think?
look a little --
Sure I'm okay.
You okay man?
Sure what's wrong with that?
You up for a drive?
How I remember them.
Not necessarily the way they happened.
I like to remember things my own way.
Yes I thought my wife...
This is our bedroom.
In this room?...
Both of you?
His or ours?
Or not so recently?
It looks like you were aware of someone.
If anything else happens you'll call us.
As best we can.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Look at all this shit...
We can go anywhere.
You got him.
Are you my man?
What about tonight?...
Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.
Take a bus...
The back door will be open...
That's his name...
If you want me to go away I'll go away.
It was a long time ago...
He told me about a job...
What's he do?
He works for Mr.
It was part of the deal.
We should stop seeing each other.
So what do we do?
I'm not positive...
Are you positive he knows?
I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I'll call you again.
We have to be careful...
I have to go somewhere with Mr.
Call me at home.
I'll give you the number.
Can I call you?
I want more.
Where's your phone?
Okay then I'll take you to dinner.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Yeah I remember.
I was here yesterday.
Who told you he was dead?
How do you know he's dead?
Bring 'em on I'm ready.
Can I call him to come in?
Can you take care of Mr.
Ready to get to work.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police.
We should all forget that night.
Did you tell the police this?
Never saw him before in my life.
Yes there was a man with you...
She brought you here...
What did you tell 'em?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night.
what did they want?
The police called us.
Sit down a minute.
Do ya good.
What night is that?
For now he's free to leave.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Same as always.
You came home.
Out in back.
What's the word on the street?
Did you ask him who he is?
Who else could it be?
No sir it's not.
You'll have to see for yourself.
Yes and we need to talk to him...
if we can.
I want to see him.
What about yesterday?
When he went to work right.
Who was the man?
I've never seen this man before.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
The first night...
Not the last two.
There is I mean I use it as a practice room...
There's no other bedroom?
But my head...
The doctor said not to give you anything.
You can see him in the morning.
I'll talk to the doctor.
I want to go in.
You want to come in?
Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
At your house.
You're where right now?
In fact I'm there right now.
Where was it that you think we've met?
of course not.
what is it?
Why did you make me wait out here?
I told you to stay in the car!
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Who is doing this?
Why would anyone do something like this?
it looks like I...
On the tape!
There was something else on the tape.
What was that?!!!
I wish I knew.
We've got to call the police.
You're up early.
You were in the house...
From the club.
I called you know.
This is a different one.
oh yeah it is.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Who's it from?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
He says there you have a choice...
How could I miss it?
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
It's late Mr.
You know who it is.
You know I love that girl to death.
Then you know what?...
It'll be ready.
If you think you can finish it I'll be back later today.
Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Well I'll see ya then.
No thanks Mr.
What'd I tell ya.
About two hundred and seventy feet.
A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Whatever you say Mr.
Give that a try.
Come on let's go.
It's okay Mr.
In the east...
the far east...
it could be days...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Tell me who she is.
I've been here.
Where'd you come from?
You want to go for a drive?
What else about that night?...
Did anything happen?
You still care about me?
Last time I saw you.
What do you mean?...
Like the other night.
What's happening to you?
You want some company?
Let me have it.
Listen to this!
Might as well - all of it.
All of it?
Oh read it!
Those are our own people.
What about those men we met this morning?
Not even a radio?
Now please go on without me.
I eat very little.
Where's the girl?
Here drink it up!
So that's where you are.
I might of known it.
We have nothing in common.
You know that's what makes the whole thing so funny.
And now look at me!
You've never told us anything about yourself.
Then I'm your man.
You never looked better in your life.
Look at what they gave me to wear.
I definitely do not like this place.
That's what they've done.
And who is he?
How'd he get there?
That's what I told them last night.
He might have lost his way.
The north is the north!
Is it a good morning?
Well it's a good morning anyway.
You said that before.
Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Well what do you know about that!
That can wait.
Say I've got to get busy.
Think of it!
In times like these.
You get the idea?
All right I will!
I'll let my hair down!
Do not wait for me!
I eat so very little.
Not for me thanks.
Well there's nothing we can do until the morning.
If you want me to!
Why you look beautiful.
Hey what's happened to you?
She'll stick around too.
Well - I'm
I think I'll stick around.
Right this very minute!
That's not likely.
Suppose she should leave it?
Not for years.
Shall we have another?
I'm afraid it does.
Well then he's the man I want to see.
Will you come along?
The only one.
Now that's news.
That's all very fine if it works out.
And very true.
Well is it?
They've never known anything different.
When was all this?
You know Mr.
How did it all start?
Buy and - sell?
buy and sell?
How did you pay for them?
Of course we have no money as you know it.
Well it must have taken
I think I'd like that.
How about law and order?
We follow many.
You should have a record made of it.
In time you will meet them all.
So there are others?
It is not particularly far but quite difficult.
Sure you can help me!
Please let me help you.
That's just fine.
Get me a doctor!
You'll soon be well if you do.
You get out of here!
I thought perhaps-
Then it's done.
I'm sure you were.
When would you like to start?
- and a very good one.
Now what would you like to do?
""  Those were my very words to myself last night.
Do you know what I did last night?
Last night Mr.
I said to myself last night Mr.
You've very kind Mr.
You may not know it Mr.
Oh I've looked around.
What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?
Apparently it's worked with some people.
You're up against the wrong man.
Now my dear boy.
If they take us.
But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
He's just trying to get out.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
You've got to let me rest!
Are you taking me?
I thought so!
He wants them to stay away from me.
Look at me Mr.
Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
He's dead?
Oh George you must take me with you!
I'd do anything to get out of this place.
We have reason.
Look at the world today!
And it is our hope that they may find it here.
It would have to have a point.
I'll meet that when it comes.
That I be brought here?
Who had that brilliant idea?
Sit down my son.
Sit here near me.
Do you think this will come in my time?
You must not look to me for help.
That's why I came to you for help.
Yes of course your brother is a problem.
Come now child.
I've already asked them.
Come on say it!
I'm not wrong.
She told me so.
I'd know anyway.
I found out a lot of things last night.
You're wrong George.
What's she got to do with it?
About their taking care of you I mean?
I'm sorry George.
Now I think you're the one that needs looking after.
If there's something wrong with you let me help you.
Never mind the girl!
You're free to go.
You've got to talk about it.
Think of what's waiting for you.
Do you want to stay here until you're half dead?
Then you'd better go George.
What else could it mean to me?
Is that all my story meant to you?
How do you know the things they told you are true?
I will George.
If you'll only tell me about it.
I've never seen you like this.
You've got to stay here now.
I said we're getting out of here.
Come on get your things together.
George - do you mind?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
Let me up!
George come back!
George what do you think you're doing?
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
George I've been putting things together.
What brought them there?
Unless it was to meet us?
Well - I mean
That's what you said.
Did I say ""if""?
What do you mean if we should get out?
Of course you would.
At the moment it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home.
I'd give anything to be in London right now.
It's far from over from what I can see.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
What's it mean?
That's where we were this morning.
Oh George come on.
What are these people?
Oh stop it!
I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be.
They'll think to themselves - ""Something's wrong here.
You see how simple the whole thing is?
Did you make that report out yet?
You know what it means.
I want you to drink with me.
Just what I needed too.
You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Bring out any people that are left.
That will make light for them!
I give it up.
What do you suggest?
In for what?
That's what we'll do.
Where's he taking us?
We never left the air.
That's not possible!
I've thought about it for years.
And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.
I'd love it!
It's not so bad really.
The outside world.
Have you never wanted to go there?
I have never seen the outside world.
Can you tell me why?
I thought I was to be the light.
I'm thirty.
I talked to him last night.
Well I was almost born here.
He died on the way.
Whether I was born here.
It was full of this and full of that.
Oh you've read my books.
You do more things!
What have my books got to do with it?
That was easy.
I read your books.
What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Was this your idea?
You know each time I see you I hear that music.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait.
Do you want to go?
Oh my dear boy I'm sorry.
Away from here.
All of England is waiting to hear about my brother.
It's good too.
Here have some.
What do you want him to do?
Right over my head.
Oh my word!
All right I'll be there.
Please say you will.
I'll make some for you!
You will come today?
And if I say yes?
What the hell...
It's not even a fucking door.
And if you want to find out even a little you'll shut up and come with me.
Go with them.
Now I'm sorry.
But this has been one long bad day.
Actually at this point I just want A job.
"" Answer: that's not his head.
Then I think--"
The hell were you thinking?
Apparently I did air.
I'm not talking about that.
The hell happened?
But You'll get used to it.
It'll make sense later?
You just asked...
Have a good day.
You're not to stand out in any way.
What happens if I say no?
No-- it makes sense.
you know when you say ""normal what, exactly...
Best of the best of the best...
It's just still find it a little...
But I'm usually wrong.
All the time sir.
Do you ever think that maybe just maybe other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Then where did it--?
Sir I'm sorry.
I mean everything here comes from you.
what are you talking about air?
I told you to go home.
It's been a long night.
We'll get that son of a...
whatever the hell he's the son of.
I thought you just--
it's in the car--
I'm telling you..
I'd go with number three.
You two especially.
Actually that's a very good question.
The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
I need you to look at it.
I said I need you to look right here.
You others go on.
It goes with the job.
That was your plan!?
In case I need it.
in case I need it?
Hold onto it--
Oh and here.
Do his job.
then where are they?
We saw it in the office.
It went from this big...
in a day.
Maybe they've been here.
Since how long?
Did it leave when everything else left?
That's my point.
For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things.
Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.
Well maybe it is.
I know what you're saying.
All I'm saying--
if you think about it then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
How does that help me?
Well in his own mind yeah.
What if from his point of view he is?
He's here to help!?
Do they have anything?
You know something?
I actually never think of that.
Maybe we should.
Where's it coming?
Get back in the car!
I think that's what's happening...
You think that's what's-happening?
The radio show?
And what's this...
You really think?
I think we'd know if held left.
They're either gone...
what's this?
Let's check am out.
Well one thing's for sure.
What'd you do before this anyway?
I think you're too used to it.
If you ask me you've been doing this job too long.
Believe me you get used to it.
Just so I understand...
you're ""thing"" is...
And what if I wanted to see her again?
I'm just saying it was cold.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
This is a college?
It's the way we do it.
The way we've always done it.
I think it'd be a good look for you too.
Well first of all...
We wear black.
What if he actually means what he says?
I feel a long day coming on.
You know there's something we never really thought of...
The only thing I could think of would be...
how do you get rid of them?
Is it my eyes...
or is that thing a little...
What the hell does that mean?
how did they get here?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
It's hard to find.
Nobody ever goes there.
what is it you say you do?
Actually you may have.
Do have any idea what I just said?
I very much enjoy that.
Right right-- I like that stuff.
Oh yeah well you know.
I've read all your work.
how'd you hear about this?
I really like that.
But that's what I love about them.
You're not taking me in!
I understand thank you.
It's my last day of business.
Give or take.
And you know that.
How could it not?
What are you talking about it's coming?
What's coming?
to pick then up.
How'd you know that?
Did he say where?
I know what this is.
Nothing at all.
Nothing at all?
Anything in the last few years?
Yeah I'll talk to you.
I want you look--
May I have a look?
But never like this.
We'd like to take a look.
Did it leave?
They went to the President?
They went right to the President.
And they're buying it?
Hard to tell.
Jesus everyone's moving.
He's gone too.
You in or out?
That and well...
A good question.
And a simple answer.
No more war.
If I may sir...
Why you might ask?
It was set up by others to keep you away from them.
Now what are we looking at?
Look at them all.
Why do we have them?
I'm sorry John but you have to run again.
But it was too late.
Her little girl was already gone.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She just wanted her little girl back.
I see myself there.
But you still have a choice.
The others never had a chance to see their future.
Please I want to go back...
I'm not being set up.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things.
The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
I have to find out what happened to my life.
I have to know.
He'll turn around.
On the ground.
Forget that guy --
Is it now?
I'm sorry but I need your help.
I need to know how to get it.
Can you tell me if --
How did I not see this?
I do too...
I just want him back...
I want him back so bad...
Why would they set you up?
Just some guy...
Then who was he?
But not before then or you'll --
How do I find the --
Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?
And put them out.
Some not as quickly as others but let's change the subject shall we?
The future is much more interesting than the past.
I put you away --
We know each other?
That's not much.
Whatever you say John.
On account of those are not his eyes.
That's an old one.
One of our first.
You like this one?
No you're not in trouble.
People want to believe in the system.
Listen to me --
We're years from that.
They'll meet me there.
Then come to my house.
We'll talk --
I've never heard of him.
And who the hell is that?
Talk to me John.
Tell me what's happening?
In the middle of the night?
I go running down there.
He's not.
And that's not all.
What's the other thing?
You can let him look around answer his questions but watch him.
If there's any problems make sure we know about it first.
I need you to do two things for me.
Tell me not to worry John.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Somebody's thinking about this one.
We're in motion on something.
Go back to work.
Did he close the front door?
Now look at him...
Somewhere near the capital?
You set me up...
It always is.
There's nothing wrong with the system.
My father was a minister.
There's no question.
If it's a question of authority.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
You're certain?
But it's not the future if you stop it.
We'll be back in an hour.
Where the hell is that?
Just go to the beginning!
She was looking right at me.
In the milk all they see is the future.
Tell me how.
I tell you what.
I need you to get it out.
I need help with her.
Nice of you to come down here.
I'm your son.
I'm you.
Good-bye Dad...
I wanted to.
I know you would have done anything to find me.
I know you would have died for me.
I was looking for you...
I feel bad about that.
The funny thing is I started to believe he really was my Dad.
He took me all over the world.
What the hell.
All right I'll try...
now let me time you.
I love you too!
I love you daddy.
Love ya dad.
What a big boy.
Who made you do this?
If I tell you my family gets nothing.
Tell me who was it set this up?
He gave it to me.
What about the picture --
I'm asking you again who made you do this?
This way I can leave 'em something.
Who said I would?
He said you would.
But you have to.
They said you would.
I had to take him out and --
Where've you got him?
and that I needed his help.
I took care of him.
I made him happy.
Six years ago.
Some -- somebody's father?
I got lots of kids from that place --
How do I even know which one has it?
They'll pick me up...
Actually I think you'll have to run out but yes that's what you have to do.
-- and then walk out.
you have one.
Hold that thought.
You want to bring it down.
I believe in that system...
My God if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are.
No one can.
Not if I stay away from him.
So many of them...
You say some of the children died?
But once they saw their children...
he decided he would do whatever he could for them.
They were all different but all the same.
And how would I know that?
You can tell me how someone...
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Then how did he --
Oh God what did you do?
Tell you what I'll do.
That's what everyone thinks.
John was talking about her right before they took him.
There was nothing anyone could do.
How did you get this?
Sir the press conference is starting.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Tell him not now.
You know what I hear?
I did find it.
He was concerned that you might find it.
Watch the water.
He told me about this.
Wait just a second...
What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
He came to see you yesterday.
What did you talk about?
What I can do is set you up down in the --
They could have been put away.
She's already a part of his future.
We can stop him.
Here's where we're at.
Three men in a room.
I'm taking control of the team.
They show up late.
That must be why you look so nice.
We could have lunch together.
I've been working too much anyway.
What about your meeting?
How can you even tell?
The man across the street.
I've seen him before...
You know I need to use you.
That's why I left him.
And now you can leave.
Not very well I'm sure.
Or maybe I'd...
What was it then?
You mean after he lost your son.
Since right after we lost our son.
Have you been there recently?
He's not here now is he?
We used to every summer.
You and John ever come here?
You take anything in your coffee?
This your work?
The one who takes care of the other two.
But there's still the other two.
Tell me how all this works.
He wants you to come by the office today.
I just made it.
I'm here to see Mr.
Just tell me where it is.
It might be hard to get in though.
As far as...?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Bring me back eighty.
What if I gave you forty?
Is it the good room?
Not on me sir.
Do you have change of a hundred?
I can take you down there.
Is it a good room?
We got a lot happening here.
Here comes the good part...
And I'm saying yes to it.
So wait you're from where?
What is it this time.
But maybe that's okay.
Maybe that's just what you need.
He's alright.
He's great right.
Is he great?
Do whatever you want.
He's okay.
As a matter of fact I am...
What time is it there?
You're not my daddy.
He's not doing it.
I want you to take her with you.
This is who I am.
I suggest you leave while you can.
How could you let her see this?
She needs a family.
I'll give her what you never had.
And I got news for you.
I'll support you.
This is my job.
He'll hear you.
And she's his fucking wife!
Go finish getting ready.
I'll take care of dinner.
I just wish he never brought it up.
I'm just saying if --
Who's watching the baby?
Will you cut it out!
Get ready we're already late.
The easy kind.
I -- I -- I...
Get your hands off of her.
I work for her.
But what about them?
Or he never made it.
Let's get this over with.
He's meeting us there.
Heard of them.
No one is.
You know where that is?
I'll see you then.
Where is this happening?
He's running shit.
Now who knows?
How bad is it?
That's our man.
What's up.
Get away from her.
She'll be out in a minute.
Might be nice to buy your lady something.
What's your record at?
Well you look it.
It's already been a hell of a night.
Take a few days --
Is that too much too ask?
You're ready to move up.
If you're in he's in.
He's good people Mr.
He'll work it off.
It's up to me and I like a sure thing.
We try something out.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
The only reason I'm --
But no more.
Then what are you saying?
So that's it.
I'm out?
I'll work it off.
They were out of line --
Within a month's time everyone and their brother was in on it.
You know what that is today?
That's the only way to win.
A sure thing.
See that horse.
You know what I like?
You know why I like it?
Find out if and where.
A bad heart.
We get it.
We're sorry.
You're nothing.
You're not here to make fucking friends.
Yeah he's getting there on his own.
Taken care of?
Depends what night.
I can wait around if you want.
Well this is the corner.
I be off in a minute.
So's this.
What were you saying?
Sorry man but...
Can you check?
We're supposed to meet him here.
I'll be a minute.
I'll wait here.
I want to see if the baby's up.
They're together.
Where do you get this shit?
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go now and wait.
That's what we need man.
No more man.
I'm trying to save this money.
What about the room?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
What do you have left?
You're out of money?
It was six in the fucking morning.
All the more reason.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Did you hear what he just said?
Let's do it.
Put that shit out...
What are you doing.
' He said he's telling us the plan.
He wants to see us now.
We'll be down in five.
No I'll tell him.
He's right there.
What the hell did you do?
Yeah I know how you do.
I know how you do.
Hang on girls!
Just get out there.
I'll be right out.
You know how I do.
Start a new one.
Look who's back?
I'm taking the car.
Work's over.
So we're working?
You would think.
He's not our friend.
Let's just get this shit over with and go home.
What did you get off him?
You know this guy?
You got something to say --
I mean that's what I heard --
I'll do right by him.
Oh give me a break.
You sold it?
They asked who I was then told me what corner.
They asked who it was.
How'd they know who you were?
I told you what they said.
What exactly did they say?
We can walk.
Why do you think he gave us all this bread?
As a matter of fact I was.
You got a problem with that?
We just got moved up in the world.
I'll put it on my room.
You got one-fifty.
You heard the guy.
On my fucking room.
How much was it?
I'm in room...
Hello room service?
He said that's our account with the car service.
' That's us.
We're on call.
You can drink as much as you want up here.
I'll get the girl.
Is that the woman from..?
Right here's fine.
Did she say something?
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Now everyone's got one on.
What do you got there?
Jesus Christ fine.
It's not even yours.
We look good this year.
We do a good job on this we're in.
You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I think we might.
What are you doing...?
Yeah I'll probably cut out early...
Then why do you try to get in?
I thought you hate that club.
I'll page you with the number.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I got no idea.
What time you done?
I know the number.
You know the number?
I'll page you.
But if it comes up...
That's not what you said.
So it was a draw.
And you were...?
I want to leave right now.
Well come on then.
It's back here.
That's a good idea maybe I will!
He's on the list.
Did you see that shit?
How is it you're good?
You on a list?
Yeah but we're good.
The line's over there.
Watch out man.
I'm on the list man.
You look good man.
You look big man.
What's up man.
And make that drink a double.
Can I help you with anything else?
Would you care for another one?
You're up front.
Everything's free up here.
How much is what?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
You really in trouble?
Why am I bad?
What I say bad?
No man that's fine.
Here's the money.
That's alright man.
It's a little early for me to drink.
You just got here.
No thanks man.
We got to head out.
Here they are then.
You want another drink?
Does anyone want another?
What's say we have a drink?
Set us up so you know you feel at home.
And where is...?
I thought you might.
Any idea what the job is?
So you're our own private guy?
Call that number.
You'll love it.
Is it nice?
You need anything you call.
You boys want anything?
Take a week off come back and we'll talk about the next thing.
So tell me how it is.
You will not speak to anyone while you are working.
It is a car service.
' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go.
You will not carry anything for that matter that I have not just given you.
And where do we bring it?
And the money.
Where do we bring the money?
You should each find fifteen hundred --
That's none of your fucking business.
But he sent you all.
Shut it man.
You'll love them.
So here's the plan.
Yeah you're working.
Nobody told us anything.
Who's up for a night on the town.
This shit's fucking brilliant.
And where might that be?
' Where do you live?
Well that's news to me.
No man I'm doing okay.
The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
That really you Red?
Take it easy baby.
That's what it is.
Walk on out.
Oh sit down man.
Was you that high?
What you talking?
Daddy where's my money?
I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.
Baby what's today?
Bet you are.
I'm there daddy.
I keep all my numbers in my head.
I've never written any down.
I told you less paper less trouble.
Let 'em come.
You looking good Little.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
You might just do Little.
I'll get a hold of you.
Where can I get a hold of you?
I like you country.
Where I come from.
Not this boy...
I got my own.
Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Bet you like that shit.
You better not be.
What they call you?
He had it coming.
What you say?
You back on top.
Yeah got to do something about you.
That's a fact.
You want a new car?
You want a new house?
It's the money right?
Now about our coming up in the world a little.
You're a man of the world.
I'm sure we can.
God knows I want to.
Tell Him that.
I will do it.
All white men.
I sure met some.
I knew you'd hear me.
Less than nothing.
The first men on earth were black.
Black men were never like that.
Start at the beginning.
Page one the first one.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him.
That's a white man's book.
Show me man.
What the hell for man?
Everybody knows God is White.
I'm telling you boy that God is black.
What happens if you give all that up?
What do you do with your time?
The question is who are you?
Maybe you'll hear me then.
Looking like me?
What did you give it to me for then?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Talk daddy I'm listening.
You got some more?
You need something.
Man what do you want?
Put it in a cup of water.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Not exactly but I want to be one like you.
I saw what you did.
Next week Brother Minister.
No Brother Minister.
Come sit with us.
Thank you Brother Minister.
I just put them to bed.
Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Dear heart where are you?
Dear heart I love you.
We'll all be together.
We need you too!
Our people need me.
Dear heart you have to help me.
What about our children?
Is that what this is about?
Our people know what I'm doing.
No what's the matter with you?
Woman have you lost your mind?
There's always talk always been talk and always will be talk.
Talk about what?
Not a real one.
I just want to sit here and be still.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Dear Heart I love you.
Nobody as young as you should be that serious.
You're with me even when you're away.
I'll be away a lot.
Just hold me.
Did you eat?
Did you hear my answer?
At a gas station.
What have you set your mind to?
We need every one.
Oh yes there is.
I know a lot about you.
Let's talk about you for a change.
You've been on your feet for days.
I've had you on your feet for hours.
I see your point.
Let me explain.
I'll do better than that.
I'll show it to you.
Women talk too much.
If you want to tell me.
Sure I'll speak to your class.
But I'm a hard man on women.
Down front as always.
Is my family here yet?
The way I feel I ought not to go out there today.
Brother Minister what is wrong?
She has nothing to do with this.
You tell me not her not anybody else.
I wish you'd listen to us.
What about the meeting tomorrow?
Let some of us come down there.
Let's get out of this cold.
Just what are you saying?
Now just a moment just a moment --
Just what is your question?
As Jesus was.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus son?
I'm one.
Let him finish.
Well I have this to say.
is called -- by the white man?
"" Would you agree?
You put it very well.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
That was a very bad statement.
Yes sir I did.
Let me do it then.
Say what you're saying.
Can I ask you something?
If she got eyes she do.
She comes in a lot?
I say a lot of things.
They gave us the book.
Save it baby.
Save it for Mr.
I do know I love you.
Baby I'll call you tomorrow.
I mean it's late baby.
I better not come in.
Now you come back.
Did you hear me?!
Your control over your children therefore --
I think sometimes Mrs.
These are my children.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
It's the same questions Mrs.
Since the death of your husband --
You're my father.
I'm with you Brother Minister.
Brother Minister I have to level with you.
Please make way please --
Thank you Brother; Sister how are you?
Baby I got to let this old man win.
You had the number.
You will baby -- if the time come.
Yeah girl; that's your story.
What's your story, baby?
You better believe it.
You the man.
You hear me, girl?
Baby, take your time.
You seen anyone?
Baby, I love you.
If you got a mind.
Come on, baby.
And I meant what I said: join us.
You the man!
How about you baby?
The hell you are.
Try this on for size.
Well, all right, then.
Jesus Christ, no.
You got it, you got it!
I'm the man.
You want to be the head man?
Might be, shit.
Man, I know this town.
Might be all right.
So what about him?
Who the hell are they?
He was not brought out.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister.
All I want is support for my children.
He should provide for his children.
That's all I want.
He told you that?
Brother Minister he often talked about you.
President of his class.
They talked about me like
I was special.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Are you two fucking?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids.
You're what I wish I could be.
When they see it works.
You can do as much in days as I can in years.
The same thing as you.
Man On Fire.
Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
If they can.
What am I doing here?
[I have a friend there.
[Where are you coming from?
I show, you give me the information?
But I need to see you.
He's high on my hit list.
Where do I find you?
I need something.
I'll call you in the AM.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
It's a little late.
We're interested in the same thing.
I'm writing a story.
A lot of people are looking for you.
[What is his name?
We never see his face!
We have to wait in the other room.
[Four-seven-four-seven.
[The number you use at the bank machine.
We have no number to call.
[How does it work?
[Not for a long time sister.
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
[So am I Sister.
[She's late Mr.
[Who's he?
I just do my job.
[I believe you.
[Where do I find him?
We work in parts.
They just make the deal!
How did it work?
[Who are you?
[Do you know who I am?
A dead girl is worth nothing.
[The girl's.
[Her life for your life.
[What do you mean?
I will give you a life for a life.
[Your brother wants to talk to you.
[This is not possible.
But in that house I have money.
If I tell you where --]
[I want you.
[The most important thing in life is family.
And there you are.
You have my family.
[How much do you want?
[That's all I know!
I'm sorry for the girl.
But it was business!
[Two and a half!
The rest was paper!
[Two and a half.
That's how much there was.
So tell me more.
[And I had my men ready.
I saw the opportunity and got lucky.
Is that likely?
Have you used this type before?
Show me please.
Not far from here.
I'll take the.
I gave that up.
Two days gone.
I said the plan was right here.
' I said what happened to the plan?
I've heard of it.
Never happened to me though.
I mean nothing.
Oh you know that?
Then decide if you want to...
stick around or not.
I think he's in trouble.
Who's the guy?
I've known you fifteen years.
You do your best.
Well you'd have to keep it under control.
You certainly look the part.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Just wanted to see you how you were.
Not for eight months.
You been working?
So how's business?
So what's wrong?
What do you mean I'm here?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
I could do it.
I know why.
And I saw that car again.
You think too much?
Now that's a question.
Still not a question.
That's not a question.
Could I stop you?
Could I ask you a question?
And why'd she have to go with him?
Your father has business.
I know you're not.
It's no wonder you're late.
Two or three.
Did you used to?
Like meeting me.
Where you're from is what happened to you.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Also I enjoy history.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
You feel sorry for the husband?
Well it's a sort of wife.
It was in a book at school.
You need to practice.
I always finish second.
In a week you should be fine.
It's not too bad.
Will it take a long time before it's better?
Can you put your weight on it?
Does he have a name?
I'm too old for him.
But I did have two kids.
They can stay for two weeks.
They'll be back in a week.
It's better to be free right?
Well I let him go.
How do you think he got out?
Did you hear him?
Do you think he'll come back?
I thought I heard him.
Once I get in the water but not starting off.
I never thought about it.
We're taking a different way home.
Four a day.
What do you think about that Mr.
Time will tell.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
So no talking.
But which state?
If they like me.
I was already dead.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I have lunch with friends.
It is serious Mrs.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Yes she told me.
Do you have children Mr.
Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
The food's fine.
Is the food alright?
You've done much of this work before?
You're American.
The world of our children.
About twelve maybe?
For a few months.
For a year?
But you will get what you pay for.
She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Do you know what she told me last night?
[You have the money.
The Day of the Dead.
Good night baby.
I think he's been sick.
He's alright now but I think he's been very very sick.
This is Mr.
And thank your father in the morning.
She's young.
She'll get over it.
It will be a hard break.
He has to go.
She thinks of him as a father.
You were so pleased with him.
I think it's nice he's American.
Do you have any family Mr.
A great deal of it.
My wife Mr.
I'm only asking for one thing.
[Who's that?
[And as long as we're talking information there's something else as well.
[I think he's...
[And left three more dead men.
[Is it true?
[Then what do you have to lose?
[I know this.
Listen to this.
[That's good.
[Is that good or bad?
Not only that he's black.
And they took that away.
One more dead.
I'll even help him if I can.
But I'd like to understand him.
So stay out of his way.
Or mine for that matter.
I got nothing more to say.
That's what friends do.
You just said it.
He's my friend.
Nothing else to say.
If police were involved you figure it out.
I'm here for him.
All right I'm having a fair time.
I looked all over for you last night you know that?
We just talked.
Now why did you do that?
All right I'll see you!
It's Saturday night!
There's still plenty-a action around!
It's close to one.
I been looking all over for you!
I been looking all over for you.
Yeah she looks all right from here.
That little one there.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
What do you feel like doing?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life.
I'll call her up.
I say to you ""What do you feel like doing tonight?
Well I tell you what I feel like doing.
Well what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well let's call her up.
What can we lose?
It's Saturday night.
Come on over about half past seven we'll think of something.
You will see.
This is my husband's house.
I had six children in this house.
Well that's all.
She seems like a nice girl.
Were the lights on?
I tell you.
I'm fifty- six years old.
What am I to do with myself?
Please come to my house.
You know this is no good an old woman living with a husband and wife.
You know what they say.
They say things are no good in this house.
Now I tell you what I think.
In my house you have your own room.
We are pleased for you to come.
What they say?
I tell you what happen yesterday?
It's her baby too you know.
I come in their room.
That's my son's baby!
You know the old man upstairs in this house.
He died yesterday.
Well he died.
You know who else died?
His mother died.
Everything is very nice.
How you feel?
Okay so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
I told you about him.
I'll wait for your call.
I'd like that very much.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
I been telling you all night I like you...
Maybe that would be a good idea.
You want me to take you home I'll take you home.
Oh I'm fine.
You want something to eat?
This is the kitchen.
You'll make friends right away.
I used to think about moving out you know?
And that's what I used to say.
""My mother needs me.
Actually you need your father.
You're living at home and you got your father and mother there and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Well that's what I was saying.
My father is getting old.
And we're very close.
He's a wonderful man really...
It's really a fine opportunity for me.
But I'm not sure I want to be a department head.
Well anyway I told you about my father and he depends on me a great deal and...
I really should get home I told my father...
It's only a quarter of twelve.
I really should get home...
I think anything you want to do you'll do well.
Well the point is Mr.
So it's a nice little shop.
So that's what happened.
So I just went to pieces.
It's really a nice face.
I'm thirty-four.
I'm twenty-nine years old.
I think I'm a very nice guy.
I'm having a very good time too.
So you see you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Well the last time I was up here that's where I sat.
I was up here twice before.
The last time...
You come up here often?
It was very nice meeting you Mrs.
I hope I'll see you again.
You wait till you are a mother.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
What can she do?
These are the terrible years for a woman the terrible years.
A woman fifty-six years old all her life she had her own home.
What is a mother's life but her children?
No thank you really Mrs.
Thank you very much anyway.
Well I'll tell you.
Somebody to take her home you know what I mean?
You say something?
I'm just here with another girl.
You here with somebody?
That's the one.
She died right in the hospital...
Well at the time she told me this she already had six.
Every time I saw the woman she was either...
"" And he says ""It was easy.
What girl what does she know?
This girl said...
Boy I wish I was you boy.
Five thousand down?
Stay that way boy.
Take my advice.
That's why I'm asking you.
Thanks a lot about my mother.
You only met her for two minutes.
She's a nice girl.
She looks thirty-five forty.
She looks a little old for you.
About thirty-five forty years old?
not very pretty...
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago.
I been there a hundred times.
He told me it was a very nice place.
So I said all right with me but we have to ask you.
Nobody wants her.
I'll be home in about two minutes.
Where you now?
How'd you make out?
We got a date with them tonight.
and they sit down right next to me...
So these two girls come over to the bar...
That's no way.
How's that with you?
It's a nice place to go.
Young husband and wife they should have their own home.
They told us to come down.
We thought that we'd leave it to you.
That's all right that's all right...
Every minute of the day!
"" And he said ""Oh no!
If you want me I'll go talk to her tonight.
That's just something she made up.
He coming home right now.
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She's my mother you know.
So my mother comes in...
This is a little out of my line.
He'll live if that's what you mean.
Just use common sense.
I believe it takes both.
I'd have to look it up.
I've seen it come through four times.
Stop that man!
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Just one for a start.
I just got word.
Never this close.
You've both been working close to the front.
Well he's taken care of.
There's only one way.
Where you think you are boy?
Or why you should.
I mean what were you doing?
You  must  open  me  up  again?
Live a little learn a little.
You know what these are?
Same general idea.
I want to look around before we close up.
What's there to do?
We got to stop them right here.
Be nice to see you some time.
I'm with you there.
Be right with you.
Yeah if I can.
How come nobody knows about him?
All three of us played for our schools.
When will he be able to write?
Can you round up a few of the boys?
We-all got a responsibility men.
Does that mean...?
You met him.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around!
We been had.
Now that's what I call real pretty.
Shall we check it out with the Major?
What have you got?
I'll take that one.
Just right for his age.
We'll sit where we can get the best view.
We got to head them off right at the start.
That must be about as far north as you can get.
Make it yourself or is it real?
I got some.
Oh I'm used to it.
I certainly am.
Anyway we want to get this letter off.
We think the same way.
We're a good team.
If we give them something to talk about.
But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
I was just asking...
Three to one as much as you want to put up.
A football game?
That's where a football game would help.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team.
Thanks for the drink boys.
I think I heard about that.
Well it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
And there it is.
There's nothing to talk about General.
All you have to do is ask.
Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
I work out of the hospital here.
He can move in here with us.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
They're coming.
Sure that's the right way...
The mother must have gone in.
Never mind the conversation.
Do it Dad.
We'll need room.
Okay but I'll need you to help.
Is he out?
You tell your story we'll tell ours.
So if that's okay with you we got a deal.
Your daddy saw to that.
Oh you want to play it straight?
No no that one.
He picked you.
You want it straight?
We stand behind all our work.
Part of him.
That's where he comes from...
That's the front up the road a few miles.
You can see them too if you want.
Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
We work well together.
All of them?
please sit down.
Hang in there.
It's possible
I think we could still have a chance.
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.
Let's just go in and take a look and then you think it through for yourself.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
You're asking for somebody else?
as if I needed to ask?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
In women just as much as men.
Something else we have in common.
For a start.
' Only book my father ever read.
How did you get called that?
No trouble at all.
I just go to pieces.
Why would he do that?
But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Two-man job.
They missed the boat.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
He's coming to.
I'm too busy actually.
The one and only.
How much time do I have?
That's really what I came here for.
Cover for what?
To test myself.
When do you play?
Matter of fact I thought there was.
It's out of the act.
It's a nice idea.
You work those kind of hours you got to have rest.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
They've all tried.
involved with somebody here.
If you mean...
I'll tell you my news.
We got it men...
if there is such a place.
Yes that's what I mean.
You mean who hit who?
Who started this?
And another one but it's from the south.
Two of them I'm afraid.
I can try sir.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
How were things?
Oh get out of here!
I want you to take these officers...
Get on the phone right away and...
I'll certainly take a look at these.
Where the hell did you ever get that name?
So never mind the side issues.
This one goes right to the OR.
Good morning Major.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
There's nothing like it back home.
What are we doing beginning all over again?
We might as well see him.
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Boys we're home free.
oh I'm sorry darling.
Did you get it too?
John please let me go with you!
Yes I did John.
Did you write this?
Yeah I've heard them a million times too butthere you are.
Maybe they're like me.
Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
"" It's just a"
Three hundred thousand?
I've been trying to figure it out.
About three hundred thousand.
How many people do you think we've talked to already outside the radio I mean?
Then what happened?
Well yes I was.
But I was your father then see?
Yeah that's the one.
No not that bad.
Er what's his name?
It was about you.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Say he's a friend of mine.
The one in there.
Now look John.
All right stand up.
With all of it?
Oh come on now.
Yeah I'm all right.
Oh I get the idea.
Er would you er would you like to make some money?
A third party?
Just sit down.
Oh somebody else sitting there?
Better let me talk to him.
Thank you very much for everything.
That's only the beginning.
Oh I knew it.
Oh I'm sure I can.
Well er what are you after?
I mean what do you want?
How much money do you get?
Now let's see.
Oh yes Father certainly would.
If I could put this over your Mrs.
Well yes I know dear but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
You're just like Father used to be.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of?
Who's the ten for?
Yes I know dear but Mrs.
I gave you fifty just the other day.
Now get out!
I want to get something out of it.
Now that's too much!
He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
If you do Mr.
Well what about it?
Let them see him!
We'll go them one better.
They can also hear him.
You own a radio station Mr.
Why not put him on the air?
Well that's fine.
I got it all ready.
Friend of his.
Is that the contract?
Did you speak to Mr.
Well maybe you're right.
That's not news!
All right boys here he is.
He's our man I tell you.
He's made to order.
I wish he had a family though.
What could be more American!
Looks all right
Okay sister you've got yourself a deal.
I can read.
I can read!
Okay sister you get your job back.
So what does he do?
But no no he has a better idea.
The City Hall.
You know what I'd do?
The one I made up!
Find him a job and forget about the whole business I suppose!
I'd have made a deal with him!
In what man!
You made it up.
There is no letter.
I made it up.
And I'd like to have it!
Oh I can do that.
Oh give me a chance please.
I'll take twenty-five twenty if necessary.
I'll do anything you say.
Oh let me go will you!
I been here for hours.
He's watching the other door.
Has he been here?
How many is that six?
Where'd you play?
What do you do when you work?
Yeah a little.
Hey wait a minute Mr.
Go on go on go on.
And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Yes both of 'em!
Both of 'em?
What do they want?
They say there's a girl there
Go out and find her!
Er the girl I mean!
Did you find her?
Hey do you know something?
What do you know about that?
Boy she's in a bad way.
Who's got him?
And let me tell you Long John.
When you become a guy with a bank account they got you.
Yes sir they got you!
The first thing that happens to a guy
Just like you said on the radio Mr.
That'sthat's him.
And you know it as well as I do.
Well, you can have it!
Well, thank you for listening.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Say how much money we got left?
I had it right in my hand!
It's lucky you got away from her.
You bet I will!
Here's the fifty.
Go on out and get rid of it.
I tell youit's no good.
's house right now?
That's the main idea.
What would you say about that?
You must be wrong Mr.
Yeah you bet!
That's exactly what I thought.
John I want to have a little talk with you.
I think maybe you'd better.
Where do you come in?
I'm supposed to know my way around.
I want it as soon as possible.
He came in here and I made him change his mind.
Run a story.
Me and a friend of mine.
He's outside.
How about family?
Got any family?
Thought there might be one left over.
What are you doing up here then?
And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
I was paid!
That's got nothing to do with it!
He was paid to say so!
Now hold on a minute young man!
That's rather big talk!
Everything's fine!
Is there anything wrong?
Say let's get something straight here.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right.
And me I get up to it and around it and in back of it but but I never get right to it.
Yeah yeah but look Mrs.
That's what I mean.
Good night John.
Good night Mrs.
It'll wait.
He's er he's done an awful lot for the
Did you want to see her about something important?
No she just left.
She went over to Mr.
Oh how nice!
I know one way you can do it.
Well what are you talking about?
Oh that you'll never be able to play again.
What do you mean too bad?
And he came down after the game with a contract.
Do you know what?
I-it's all right Mrs.
nothing's happened yet!
No I'm watching.
Go and look.
Open the window.
Oh why did he have to pick on my building?
Out the window!
Well what about me?
I'll take half of your action.
What's the line?
You want me to go up with you?
Just get in.
You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
He's good!
Speaking of which.
He may be able to take a little pressure off you.
Mind if we make a stop on the way?
Dinner's on you.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
Not that we know of.
Could I please have a little water?
I've got to stop in there...
Now I can hear it.
I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Nobody knows who you are.
Who gave you money?
You know what he did to me?!...
Man what's this about?
It was his job.
I could go anywhere I want.
You could leave town.
Why do you think I use you?...
So that we could get the best price.
We'll get him on the phone right now.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Tell him what what do you want me to tell him?
Tell my dad.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
I feel them all the time.
Tell me what's wrong.
They control everybody's mind.
You're too fucking stupid to know that?
The Old Guy?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
I need to get something straight first.
Where's the car?
Hold on a second here.
Who are you again?
He moved out a month ago.
I have to go face to face.
So far he's asked for...
I'll worry about that.
It's all there.
This is just between you and me.
I'll give you something.
You just do shit for me right now.
Make sure everybody's okay.
For now that's all.
I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
I want a car.
Then we'll come out.
You want to come...
went down the side of the building...
he'll be in place where he can see everything.
Then we better get moving...
So what do you want to do?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
You live with it...
That's the way you've got to look at it.
How many have you lost?
That it is.
I thought I could do it.
But it is not.
It's not easy.
There's one thing you have to remember...
You can only try to save people from them.
Would it have happened to you?
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
He's got the girl.
And doing a very good job of it.
There's your answer.
Probably worth thirty.
Is it always like this?
About six years.
How long you been coming here?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet?
This is getting sick.
Yeah first and second.
They need to run first and second?
To run late!
To run last?
Still needs work.
So what do you want?...
I have three words for you...
I have two words for you...
Now the Six looks good.
Let's move on...
That's the most important thing.
You're always on their side...
Why did he do it?
It's against my nature.
Get good at it.
Maybe we can work something out.
So what do I say to this guy?
Tell me what you need.
It'll come.
I'm here to help you.
Which you are.
Yeah you think so but it comes up.
We see each other every couple of months.
Oh ""city girl"".
Explain how that works.
You living together?
Well if I have to I have to.
Let's go for a drink.
Not the ones I'm at.
We could fill it with water.
Is there something wrong with that?
My mother was born there.
You'd never been out of New York?
Spent my whole life there.
I just wanted to get out for a while.
I'm sorry about your friend.
I know how it can be.
Try to remember that.
Like it had to be done.
Only at the very end.
I'm ready to do it.
We decided to stay out.
Only that floor.
Husband came home.
What am I giving up?
Think about how happy you were.
Same thing happened to me man.
The hell I am!
Know what you are?!
With all those people around?
I'm talking about...
the hell are you talking about?
I know it's beautiful here.
I was just thinking...
There's something special I want to talk to you about.
You've changed you know.
I've been thinking.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
And you think he'll...
Let me just show you.
It's very nice.
You like this place?
It's not that world.
It's your world.
It's part of who you are.
This is the stuff right here.
And it's hard to get.
It's already started.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Oh hell forget it.
I should have gone up with him.
I had to talk to someone.
That a new picture?
Maybe you should be.
Let me take you out tomorrow night...
He's a wonderful guy.
He's no good for you.
Now a head...
Stay up there Girl...
Yeah they are but...
Are these yours?
They knew what they were coming for.
What do we got?
Who's running it!
Who's running it?
You're much too close to it.
The department will take care of it.
I want to be put on this case.
The car is part of the deal.
Get a car of your own.
And a car.
What do you think would be in order?
The financial kind.
You let us worry about that.
He says ""Thank you very much.
I'm already dead.
You're in there.
-- You've made your point!
You've got control of the system.
Yes I believe he has --
They have nothing to do with this --
There are two million people in there with you.
I need to take back what's mine.
Not in my world.
No she said she had a son.
She said I have a son...
Just like you always wanted.
It's all here...
Who are you?!
I'm serious how did you know my name?
No not me I've been lucky.
But I've seen what happens to other people --
Your life that bad?
This is how you pick up women --
If you could meet God what would you say to him?
And down here --
That's why you're here.
It's not real.
The new world.
End into beginning.
In here I am.
You are not a God.
Not my problem.
But what would happen to me?
It's his nature.
I need to know for sure.
There is no --
Then where is she?
What did he tell you?
Listen to yourself.
It's not used for anything.
Of course they are.
He's in the fucking system!
There was no other choice.
But you were with me.
And it meant something.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
It was a test.
No one can do that.
One's you.
-- You told me.
Then how do you know about --
You went to my high-school?
Someone you have to get back to?
I've got to get back.
Some things never change do they?
Just like that --
It was just there.
No point to it.
He's on us!!
he's gone.
I'm afraid you're too late.
Perhaps there is a way...
Any way at all?
Now tell me...
what do you see?
So how can we get to it?
I've got it!
There should be a way to open it.
What's happening to him?
I heard that!
What does that mean?!
That's pretty bad.
Let's take a look over there.
Anybody see anything?
all things are possible.
The power is of another world.
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Two thirty three a.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
I'm in!
Let's go after him!!
There's enough for everybody!
Here you go!
And how do we do that?
NOW  GET OFF ME!
GET OFF ME!
Wait for me!
Did I say anything?
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Yes well I suppose you'd know a little something about that.
Not to worry.
Taking over the world is one thing.
What is THAT!
we were about to finish them off...
What do you mean ""basically""?
LET'S DO IT!?
Six become one...
Anybody see them?
He thinks like an American.
He'd like you.
And a lot more.
But not you.
Not another word.
Whatever we say.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
It's the same.
You see things through both eyes.
And now you have everything.
I had everything.
I got friends to take care of that.
We'll start small.
Only sell the best stuff.
If we have to.
We could lose the deal!
He's got a line on the good stuff.
Four-twenty-eight.
He was around...
But he'll do his job.
I want a meet.
It'll all be over tomorrow.
But there's...
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital.
I'm sorry you got hit by it.
I'm very sorry...
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
Gives us something in common.
You could have stopped him.
Have you thought about this?
I needed to see you again.
Something came up.
I'm already late.
It's Christmas.
For being a man.
I can just imagine.
And that's war on top of war.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I told you twenty!
I'll do fine.
Might as well put the time to use.
How soon can we pull this off?
One big party.
Like a party for all our friends.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country.
We all got the same problems.
We could talk.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
We'll figure out something.
So what is the problem?
That's not the problem.
In the last six months.
What you mean?
We got business.
Guy looked like you people felt sorry for 'em.
Look at this boy.
Ya did good.
But that's an hour's drive.
Take one of 'em out and they'll all line up against us.
And you'll do what I say!
I know about you.
Let him come.
He's trying to make it.
I got a place for you.
In my family...
A man needs a family.
See if these two are my friends.
Come on out.
This is supposed to be a private meet.
That's past.
The terms will be mine.
They do what I tell 'em.
But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
No one will know.
Conditions have changed.
We will work it out.
We learn from life.
I found that out.
Tell me my son.
He's not our kind.
Do business with them on your own.
You get fifteen percent.
They found nothing.
I have six hundred.
And more every week off the boat.
I've got friends.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I must know more of you my son.
I've heard so much about this club of yours.
I had to come and see.
And what do you want out of this?
they'll follow.
So change it.
That's just what I'm sick of.
The Big Picture.
I'm a hard guy.
And I never said no.
If it comes to that.
He might make our deal.
I can do it.
It's been four days!
Now that's a hard number.
One hundred thousand.
three hundred thousand.
Open a window.
This is nice.
Take any one ya like.
Ya got a minute?
Best we got.
It's as if...
He says he's...
It's got to be.
Just to see what'd come out.
before your time.
That was right about the time we met.
Let me get some food...
Three months tonight.
- Where exactly am I?
Thank me next time you see me.
- So how'd it go?
Now come here...
before I change my mind.
Well - you'd need a body.
Death I'm trying to make things right.
I'm a simple man.
I'm just doing my job.
Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me?
I have a girl up there.
And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
You have every right to be.
I want him to have every chance Doctor.
We can certainly give it...
But at three months...
At the moment yes.
He's held on this far.
Yeah I was thinking...
Got the ring.
He's got a little something I think you'll like.
It's a benefit.
Oh here's something.
So here's my idea.
She made me happy.
Which I'd never been.
I just want her saying yes to me.
I got the ring.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here?
It's all out of hand.
But who'd would want to -
Oh no no no.
We help him get your body...
Why'd you do it?
What'd I ever do to you?!?
YOU SET ME UP!!
It's all part of the deal.
HE'S GOT MY -
Land of Death.
How do I get there?
Well actually two.
Actually no there was that other guy who...
<i></i> So I need a job.
Now Death is not what you would call a people person like me.
I'm his little brother.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
she'd never...
no life support?
I think I...
I'm about to...
Is there some...
You mean - you mean I'm -
It's a special kind of party.
get what I'm saying?
Until I can get out of here...
Boys and girls...
It is new.
It looks so...
Now would I?
I know you went out.
That's front page news!
<i></i> Hey.
Are you sure you'll be okay?
You sure this is...
What are you watching?
<i></i> In what way?
you're asking the wrong guy.
It was great baby.
Let's get you to the ER.
I'd better go report this...
I'm fine baby.
We're all okay.
We were lucky.
Are you okay??
I am happy.
So face it.
What's the ""bad"" part?
<i></i> I have something I have to give you.
but it's been three months now and...
<i></i> I gave the order.
Give me a date Doctor.
This is not easy for me.
He asked me to send it to him -
I had so much I always wanted to say to him.
An hour ago.
You're okay?
When'd you get in?
my poor baby brother...
SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You'll get in trouble!
You're such a beautiful man.
But I wait and I wait and...
I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Nothing for him!
I sure wish I could take you home with me.
I'll be fine.
We got exactly five minutes left.
I never would've made it without you.
There's a thing here!
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Where'd he go??
He's taking her to the land of Death right?
OH THANK YOU!
You can come.
Thanks for nothing.
DEAD MAN WALKING!!
It was different then.
My life is great now.
I'm in love!
NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Like you'd know.
Where's mine?
<i></i> HEY!!
He's ninety.
Try not to lose it in traffic.
I'M NOT GETTING -
THAT DOES IT!
You are too!
You know you love me.
Then you can learn to act normally.
Is there something else I can do for you?
We like to think so yeah.
Have a nice day.
Oh let me get out of your way then.
I just need to use the phone lady.
Dear I was thinking.
I've never been.
I like having you around.
Oh I hope so dear.
Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Oh that has nothing to do with it.
Oh it's so nice to meet you.
I want you to see New York.
You know you never tell me anything.
He seemed quite taken with you.
Behind the books.
I've never had any problem with them.
What are they all doing there?
I wanted to ask you something.
That's New York.
You'll get used to it.
well my word!
I wonder what they do in there?
They all look so...
Well that would be a...
He's single.
Poor man had to leave town.
And I hear that other women came forward.
they're all the same.
So I called the number...
I thought today was Saturday.
She's at work.
I'm her mother.
I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
You will be fine.
It's still day.
This is one-way street.
Not during the day.
Do you know the East Village?
So you come here all by yourself?
And where is she?
It's my first time in New York.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Keep your left up.
You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names.
They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place.
Right over there.
Looks like it but--
But you did *talk* to Mr.
You've never *seen* this contract.
I did not--
And while you're at it get me a bed!
All right boys--let's go.
Yes sir--big as life.
Been there some time now.
Not a word!
It's up to you and the boys.
The war's on!
Well then that's great!
And that's a great place to leave it!
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- ""What does your wife think?
Did you see his *face*--?
You know you'd give your right--.
"" He might *listen* to *you*--"
And now they're all down on him.
Right now--everything I own--!
I'm getting out of there.
Okay--I mean--
Say you think it's beautiful.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah--that's right.
Do we *have* to?
*All right*, then.
After all, what's it to me?
Well--cut it out.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
How'd you feel?
I told you to keep him out!
Some of my best friends are funny.
There's more light here he says--
What's it *to* you?
I said, Mr.
"" He had me.
Get the day off?
That's taking place outside now.
What about the second act?
Did you like the first act?
You play--left field.
What do I play?
Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town.
*Now* what am I?
Oh--that again.
You know--Mrs.
Tell me why!
How do you *like* this!
No wonder--without your dinner.
You might actually learn something?
Of all the times!
All right why?
The first thing to do is-- present Mr.
Are you ready for him Bill?
Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!
It's high *time* I told him a thing or two!
Jim said to wait.
Ten to one they've got a man.
Never mind how.
You just use your *high office* to help him get it done.
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
*But you never asked me*!
*Your* political future!
I bought it for you and made you a present.
I said forget 'em!
Those men were--
We've given you the man.
Happy we've got the man.
Just one minute!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right.
Oh a *boy*!
Is *what* getting me down?
What's the matter Dad?
Is it getting you down?
Will you *please*--?
I *thought* I heard...
Get *out* of here!
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Here they are--I got them.
They are all right.
I never knew there was so much American history.
Just a minute I better make sure.
For one week!
For a question!
You've *got* to come!
--come with me!
Yes sir you bet I would.
And I was in that room!
A point of order!
For a *question*.
Ah now that's better.
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water.
Good as new!
It's quite all right--
Well--looks good as new.
Here--where are you running off to?
I will sir!
I knew if any man could help me--
What's to stop you?
Well why not do it?
There's a job for you.
Yes I was--
I suppose Mr.
You're just like your father.
We'd better see.
You were saying something in the other room sir--
Now now now!
Good evening sir.
What is your interest in this Mr.
And maybe right for all I know.
Yes so I was told Mr.
Like what Mr.
To a hard night's work son.
Where do we go from here?
We'll *find* one!
--what you said about Mr.
--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along?
Well--that was *you*.
But--I've done everything I--
Well--that's about the only thing to do.
I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr.
That night--I--well *you* know-- I was pretty--.
It was a wonderful party.
And she looked beautiful and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--""Thank you Mr.
"" Oh but it was the way she *said* it.
We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
I'd be--.
I--I'll be there!
Yes--right here.
Not another bill?
Say--have I got some paper here?
Oh those are only local.
All these letters?
No--not today!
I've got a scheme to put people to work.
Want to hear it?
What do they--?
Who are all those--?
You have that.
Money to be--
No *reason* to take it up with him.
You've never been out there you said.
I've got more.
You better tell me.
It *is* not!
Well if it's all the same to you--
Maybe that was my trouble all along.
I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Terrible thank you.
Father was a doctor.
Since sixteen or so.
Have you always had to--work?
But you've had beautiful country all around you.
You've just had to life up your eyes!
You mean--here?
I've been over every foot of it.
Well anyway it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important.
He knew my father you know.
And they get to be men--and forget even more.
My children will.
How big is this thing?
Where is it to be?
How many boys will it take care of?
Your Bill has to have all that in it--
I did--and--and I got right up.
Try sitting down.
And a *lot* of paper!
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
They make more changes.
We're over in the House.
Pardon me--*this* is.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
That's the order of business.
Some committee's got it.
Yes I see that.
Where would you get?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run.
All work has to be done by committee.
And we light into this.
Your Bill is ready.
Oh just a day--
And with your help--
*This* one is so simple--
Oh but this one is so simple.
Now what does he do?
He's got to sit down first and write it up.
The where when why how--and everything else.
That takes time--
*I* should have been the one to think of it--
Nothing better could have happened--.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes.
What had you better--?
You know what I better do in the morning?
With or without 'em.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
I'll *see* that you get there.
Well--he's got nothing on me.
There he is--Mr.
There *what* was?
Did you say--bus?
Pleased to meet you sir.
Oh no--no!
Is--is something the matter?
Come on now--that's enough of that.
"" asked so-and-so and turned away!
That's more like it!
Hear you got a Boy's Club back home!
See there you are!
I'm not making sense!
Oh the bill.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Then you *did* say it.
Oh--you are!
Did you hear Father?
Fine--they're fine.
I--I would never say a thing like that.
I--I'm sorry sir.
I--I have a bill--
""So help me God.
So help me God.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Oh--nothing--nothing.
Well--I have got *one* idea--
What does he want to--?
What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What did *I* have to do with it?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
He's done for!
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off.
This boy's honest not stupid.
Let's get away from here.
Did I hear right?
You *told* him to!
Be right along.
See you here.
Well that's out.
Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
I'll make it right with you!
There's a *story* in this guy--!
He did it.
I'm not fit for office!
I was just getting rid of all that.
If I did *anything* I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--.
I'm all through.
I thought I could too.
*My* business--this fine future!
The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him.
All right--*yes*!
And what does that make me to him?
I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Well--me too!
And I'll tell you what we'll do.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You're more than that.
So you see--
That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned.
I meant it for one.
Well--that's very fine.
By the way Mr.
Have you any idea where?
No--I'm sorry.
No idea at all.
Keep doing it!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
I've done it all my life!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
No--I--I'll take a walk--
If he gets to his feet and says anything--
*I* know what I'm doing!
I'll say what I *want*!
Meet the boys--
Let him in.
Oh it's all right--it's all right.
We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense that's all.
This boy's different.
I think I can.
Wait a minute boys.
We must be absolutely sure of him.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Will you get it out for me?
At your service!
Some people like it.
That's very nice of Mr.
Talk to anybody.
Who do you think I'm talking about?
It's very important.
He sure is.
Yes you own it.
He always does it.
We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Most every day.
He was a seven-months baby.
Since he was born.
No no children.
Would you like to go for a walk?
The woman's obviously in love with him.
Oh thank you!
I'd like to explain
Yes but I
And you saw them happen?
Just to make him look silly!
But they did take place?
Are they true!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Oh hello darling.
Would you like to read it?
It's to you.
Yes here we are again.
Well here we are again.
All my life I've wanted somebody to talk to.
In a day or so I think.
Let's just walk okay?
I'd like to read it some time.
You know what I've been doing since I got home?
It's about you.
Well that's very nice.
No - not at all.
It had better be good.
Oh I suppose you could do better.
"" Would you like to hear me?
What did he play?
He was a lot like you my father was.
Talked like you too.
What do you know about that!
I'm from a small town too you know.
People here are funny.
What did you mean by that?
You know you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Here's a nice place.
Now what do you see?
That depends on what they see.
Yeah let's.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way?
It's so nice out.
That's what I like about you.
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Oh that - well we had another meeting.
I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
I met you.
Well I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
If I lived in New York I'd go there every day.
I'll bet you do.
I enjoy it.
There's just one thing more.
Oh that was so lovely.
Oh I'm really just a nobody.
Tell me more about yourself.
Feel better now?
I've been looking for a job all day.
I found one too.
I start tomorrow.
Oh no really - I'll be all right.
Look this is my house.
I'd like to
Oh did I?
Why there she is!
Of course she's home.
Stupid of me.
Do you know what that is?
Yeah I thought so too.
You know what he told me tonight?
Yeah then what?
Why do we have to do it?
That's where you were an hour ago.
It's for you.
I'll put you on another job.
You need never see him again eh?
I only hope he does.
I'm having lunch with him today.
I just got carried away.
She is out the door.
Oh my lunch hour.
He was so far along he never even missed me.
What happened after that?
Had the boys follow us.
How'd you get the picture?
I'll keep the whole front page open.
Oh he's not getting away with anything.
Look I can do it!
Come on - let's go!
Come on come on!
Yes but you said
All right and I'll get it again!
I'll take it easy.
Those books'll never leave this office.
You must have said that a thousand times already.
Will you get Mrs.
We've got nothing to worry about.
Leave everything as it is.
How is this sir?
Sit over there will you?
Yeah that's fine.
Here it is sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Yes quite all right.
I'll talk to her.
Give me the phone quick.
Will you show Mr.
What do you think they want?
We'll send for the police!
He's not home I tell you!
Maybe they have!
Come on John.
I'll do no such thing.
What was that you said he was?
He's what?
Suppose you just answer Miss Jane.
They probably expect you to carry on.
I even went to his house.
We'll see you later.
That's pretty.
But it's a great story.
Go to it.
Yes of course if you wish.
Not till I find out what's on your mind.
How can he make any trouble for me?
Tell him to see me at my office.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought Mr.
That is to say
He left everything to us.
You should do the same thing Mr.
Oh yes there've been a lot of them around here already.
Leave everything to me.
Oh yes I heard you all right.
If there's anything I can do to
Are your parents living?
But that's not where he makes his money.
Well we'd like to find out something about him.
What does he do for a living?
That's very kind of you.
Come in please.
Can I get you a cup of tea?
Get lunch for the rest of them.
Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
I'll take care of that.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance.
"" What do they mean by that?
Did you see this stuff in the paper?
How'd it get in there?
What'd you do last night?
Who were you talking to?
I'll be seeing you!
Ever heard of 'em?
How would you like yours?
Well how about tonight?
Only common sense.
They're important people.
You'd better get right down there.
Send it right away.
I've got it written out though.
Have a drink?
Why should you?
I wonder why he left me all that money?
Maybe lots of things.
You see I expect to do a lot of good with that money.
You see Mr.
Now where were we?
The wrong kind!
What does the Chairman do?
I'm Chairman.
I'm Chairman?
I'll look 'em over later.
We got a good price on them.
That's what I want!
You know we've got letters.
Oh no I'm not.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
No I mean - about my client.
What about it Mr.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
Well what about it Mr.
If she was his wife she should have all the money.
That's only fair.
Common-law wife.
On top of that there's a child.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
I leave it to you Mr.
Yeah what if I am?
Why you must drink!
Anything else Mr.
That's kind of funny.
I mean about Mr.
Do you mind if I talk to them?
I was watching you.
There's been so many things said about me that I
Take the stand!
Over at that big round table.
You sit right there and eat your lunch.
Hear what he said?
You know how much twenty million is?
Now you keep out of this!
That's what's the matter with him.
How about lunch?
Been waiting two weeks for this.
A nice long one.
Is she home?
Oh yes - yes of course.
Yes I've been her sister for a long time.
What do you want!!
Shall I call the police sir?
Here it is right here sir.
What's an hour!
What is it sir?
Hey did you hear that?
But she's on the telephone
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
I'll get you some black coffee sir.
The ones who brought you home sir.
Back to nature!
As a matter of fact you came home without any clothes.
I did what!
You came home last night - without them.
I remember everything!
Oh I do too sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
It's late!
That was something I was never able to find out sir.
What did he do with them?
Well sir he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Get up from there.
Get up from there!
What do you think you're doing?
You can go out there if you like...
And that's how I feel right now...
I know my time's up but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name.
It's happened before.
You must have been concerned.
Not till Saturday afternoon.
It had nothing to do with what happened.
One hundred books?
I just want to know what the argument was about.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
And you can meet the kids.
you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Me more than most.
What do they want from me?
What have I done that's so wrong?
Everybody's got something...
Even you probably have things.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner.
I'm not sure she'll come.
Do you ever go to somebody's house?
a lot of things.
Yeah I got that.
And I'm not sure that's the best thing either...
There's a lot of debate about it.
So you know all about it?
Could you come with me please?
We got a three hour drive here.
But they're certainly dead.
You never got back to me.
I think he's got a point.
There is good news though.
I think I've heard of him...
I've run on.
We're here to talk about you.
What are you doing for lunch?
I've heard great things about you.
It's nice to see you again.
I want to know what's in here.
But you did come to me.
-- and you told me that.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
Let me just say something here...
Should I open it now?
It's a thought I had.
You are so mean.
I had to get rid of her.
I never said that.
Not me you're not.
I'm paying for this.
Good then go.
You might as well not come.
I only been seeing you --
I have eighteen more minutes!
What brought this on?
Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Do you want to come in?
You're the doctor what do you think?
Out of control.
What do you think's wrong with her?
We've done...
You've done well.
We've got twenty-three people working there now.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said ""I should have spent more time at the office.
I think you'll like this.
Sorry I'm late...
Have another drink I'll be back in five.
and that you are who you say you are?
Well come on in.
That's a lot of people all at once.
I'd better get in there.
to be so...
Yeah it's very nice...
me you too...
I was at your house...
What it might take is...
No matter what it takes.
That's what you're giving me?
Here it is some advice -- do the hard thing.
I want to give you something.
Will you let me?
That's a big deal.
He told you.
Where am I supposed to eat?
They come through a few times each year.
Not that I care.
I've had it with men.
Took me four years to get the last one out.
Why do you watch?
You heard it here first.
it's no walk in the park.
What'd you do tonight?
It's a pretty piece of land.
Do we run into the street?
How's that place?
You like me.
Oh so that's him?
Four months two and a half weeks -- that's how long.
How long you been in this town?
You're terrible.
I'm never telling you anything.
Man you see him a lot.
Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
I think it's like...
You're early...
it's not ready.
It's a country club.
Come out this way.
but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
My family got five hundred times better.
Is she a friend of yours?
That would explain it.
But no car?
But you know how to drive?
It'll never happen!
What kind of doctor are you?
I've put myself completely in his hands.
For today anyway.
Do you think that's a good idea?
What's happening here?
like the town?
No you can not.
Just who is here can you tell me?
Good evening Mrs.
Well look who's here...
You're something.
you see the problem is --
I think you know what I mean.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What'd you want?
not a real doctor.
Will you be here?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you wait for me?
You got off easy.
but first you have to tell me something...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you...
but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
But there is one...
Please believe me I know that...
This is a terrible thing you've done.
You're not the only one...
You probably got the idea.
Part of it.
We were watching ""ER"" until someone called.
Which show was that?
What do you think I'm after Mrs.
Yes and that is what I have got right now.
that I am in love with you.
No it is not something I've heard about you!
Is there something I should have heard about you?
Is it something you've heard about me?
That must take years of training right there.
I need to talk to you...
I need to find a man like you.
With you I feel really...
Can I tell you something?
You have a wonderful way with people.
I feel like you've seen me clearly...
You've made that possible for me.
I bet I know what changed your mind...
That's one way to put it.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I thought I had something to tell you.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
That's what I like.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out.
And he's where?
Fourteen years old.
No that'd be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end.
We went on for another year or so.
Oh there's something wrong with you all right.
who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Well I was so...
Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me...
I'm just not getting it right.
Can we rest for a second?
You're doing great.
They're about the same.
But you get more now?
Yeah most people have that.
Yes yes and definitely yes.
I feel like an old person or like I did back when I used to work out too hard...
The list is so long.
What would it take?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Me especially but Dad of course.
Is she against you getting help?
She's like that all the time.
It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
this should be interesting.
So what changed?
No one ever thought so.
You must bring it out.
You have the best answer for everything.
You seem so...
I'll come to you.
We'll try a little walking.
we would try several things.
But I need to see you a lot.
Maybe I can help you do that.
A change of job of living situation...
Maybe it is.
My mother always says -- ""Everything that's wrong with you is in your head.
"" I suppose that's true.
I saw it in your eyes.
You think that now!
God it seems like years.
When did you start to feel this way?
What can you tell me about this?
Most people do.
And I made him give up his.
I said I'd consider it.
What're we...
As you can see --
What did he want you to do?
He said -- ""Which we already knew!
Do you think that's what he wants?
Should we stop them?
Was it something that happened at school?
which we already knew.
We're not done.
I just need to find the thing...
What do you want me to see?
That's not quite what I said --
I've been thinking about what you said last time.
Which we already knew...
The New York Times.
"" Which we already knew!
Where was this?
What kind of deal is that?
It's a big part of the show.
In maybe three or four issues.
What do you mean ""in no time""?
It's not me is it?
Yes yes it does...
Right now of the two of us I'm the only one in love.
I'm giving it up.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
See you Thursday...
I've got a million questions.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind.
That's all most people are looking to do.
But you're good at it!
All new people start with that...
You know how easy it is.
The new you.
Who'd you go with?
That's not good.
I'd take five a day if I had the time.
Things got a lot worse.
Hey you've done good.
Look at yourself...
But look at me now...
What it felt like was...
Every time I'd leave a life it felt good.
Sounds like you have several.
What about everything?
I can tell you anything else.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
Mum -- Wait a minute.
Who else knows?
Oh it's okay.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
How's it coming?
The world has never seen what I'm talking about...
It's true believe me.
Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It.
let's say that for now.
Just between us?
But yeah I'm a little concerned.
Hey maybe that's all right!
It's just a thought.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
And it's been good...
I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Nothing can live up to it.
His wife got sick of it and left him.
Took his kids with her.
Pretty good too.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
I've seen her.
Have you got a lot of friends?
Hell yes I like it.
What's better than this?
So would you say we're out here...
let me think how to put this...
Is your problem really that you're...
that's the thing.
Like I said just about everybody in town works for me.
And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you.
It's like an order or something...
They're busy.
It's not as easy as you think.
This is exactly what I wanted.
I've got three big ones.
I have a lot of money.
Do you know how much money I've got?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town.
Is that the question?
Been that way since...
Have you thought about getting a wife?
That's exactly what I want.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Can I pick it?
That's the kind of thing I can do if I want...
I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Where'd that come from?
I've heard a lot about you.
See I think there's not much that can be done about most problems...
If I can get a sense of that well then maybe...
just maybe I can help them out a little.
That was a terrible thing.
I probably know him.
We must do that.
Well okay then.
You know where he's taking her?
He is not of this world.
And how does one do that?
He needs the book...
And your sister.
What does he want the book for?
You shall see.
You're my only friend.
Where's your new friend?
So who's this guy?
You left me!
I wanted to be with my friend!
I've had worse.
Let's make us even shall we?
My very good friend!
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Now go find me a big stick.
and how do you say?
Oh yes always.
and then I remember nothing.
That's one way of putting it.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
What is he doing here?
Why do I put up with you?
It will be done.
They leave tomorrow as well.
No one has ever had so much been so close.
We must stop her or it will be the end of us all.
She has seen too much.
She knows too much.
She is like all the others.
Correct And that's when --
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
You will not believe it.
The hell with this.
The hell with that!
What did you do to him!?
Yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent.
I would never!
Three hundred pounds!
Two hundred pounds.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
No women allowed.
Where are they taking him?
he was just looking for a good time.
And what did he say?
I did not know so when I heard you were coming I asked him that myself.
Yes I know and I'd like to keep them.
Did you see that guy's face?
You called me your girl?
Are you sure!?
I saw him!
That thing is here!
That's what I am to you?
It's everybody's problem!
Is that my problem?
Alright then Me I...
I told you not to play around with that thing.
No we are not.
Forget it we're out the door down the hall and gone.
I've never seen a mummy look like this.
He's he's still...
Is he supposed to look like that?
And what is that?
Okay I get your father I get your mother and I get your brother but what are you doing here?
That's what I believe.
Who was talking about what?
That's what he was talking about.
Oh my god...
Yeah that'd bring you back to life.
We're almost there.
It's all up here.
You know your history.
What do you think is out there?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Want to know?
Could you tell me how to get there?
I saw death.
-- I know what you mean.
I was there alright.
The City Of The Dead.
No I mean --
Yeah I was there.
I know my brother.
What's it look like!?
What do I do!?
Shut-up and get me off of here!
I found it
Did you ever see him eat?
You're dead when they do this
Do you really think he'll show up?
I'm your sister.
Everybody knows the story.
The City of The Dead.
Alright good that's good.
I think you found something.
Oh yes I do!
I have something right here!
Right now I only wish to join them.
I'm with you old man.
Believe it sister.
That's two down and only two to go.
Yes I know I do that to people.
Who's here!?
You did not!?...
We're not!?
She's my sister actually.
I've spent six months watching you and know exactly what you're up to.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I know you knew I'd know.
I knew you'd know.
This is our night.
You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me.
Darling you've got the wrong idea.
I thought you were done?
Who could possibly stop us?
Hey do I look like a Man?
Do it big boy!
Come on baby!
We could really use some coffee --
Much less go outside.
I was eight.
When was that?
He was the last time I saw him.
My father had this friend...
When my mother died I hit bottom...
and I knew what I had to do.
it's a guy thing.
Or even what it looks like.
Sounds good to me.
No one will believe us.
But in fact...
you'd found it.
They thought I'd lost it.
But she's your mother.
We know who we are.
What did he mean?
Get on to yourself!
How's your dad?
Why you're so...
And the light goes out...
Are you with me...
or against me?
Or you'll what?
I saw him walk you home.
Remember the cat.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Just wanted to...
I'd love to hear you read it.
We might never see each other again so I'd better tell you now...
I think you're wonderful.
Just shut up and listen.
Get out of there!
That's what I mean...
It's home.
I love this stupid old town.
Have you always lived here?
What's your real name?
It's so...
I get off work in fifteen minutes.
Walk me home?
You busy after work?
He is in love.
We're all the same really.
Maybe we look a little funny...
And to hell with the rest of you!...
It is not dead.
My heart died a long time ago.
You drink too much.
Not a chance!
I'll drive.
Are you coming or not?
But she still might call!
But there's still only six of us.
I used to believe that.
Now I'm not so sure.
But we know they're out there.
There's just not enough of us.
Have you ever seen him?
Yeah yeah -- and that too.
And it would be the right thing to do.
We had an off night that's all.
She's his mother not yours.
And if it did how would we know it?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
The only thing that's in your way...
Maybe there was traffic.
This is the break we've been waiting for!
Maybe she's right.
But look at him...
and look at us.
We need a break that's all!
IT'S THE SAME GUY!
Anybody got any?
only when no one is looking.
So what can I get you?
So you're like...
Ever since you were a little boy...
I always knew that you were special.
this is wonderful.
I use it...
Oh Mother I'm sorry.
it's not what you think!
It's on the television.
That was too close.
But how do we get in?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
Whatever our name is.
Yeah but how do we get to them?
And a social life.
This is bad.
Ask her out.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Very well General what is it you wish to say?
I must be honest with you.
There are none here.
What do you have in mind?
Things are quite serious I should say.
Would you care for a drink?
Ah my dear friend come in come in.
Please sit down.
Have you anything you wish to say?
I did sir.
But where are my wife and son?
What's become of them?
She was sitting there...
and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before...
Did you see her?
Who is there?
Come back in an hour.
Oh shit that's not right.
Read it back.
I will do that.
No sir none at all.
Just a minute General.
Yes as a matter of fact it is.
That's a nice city.
No they're living in Nice now.
Is your family still there?
Have you been back recently?
Oh -- where do you come from?
When you eat him may I have some?
My God -- this could be very bad for us...
very bad indeed.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible?
When did it start?
My God what a fire!
Have you sent for a doctor?
How do you expect me to find yours?
Does your mother know you have come?
And he sent you to me?
I have met her.
What is your business with me?
I'll have the fire built up.
But he asked me to say...
Yes -- an excellent idea.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
That's a very nice name.
Oh I'm sorry about that.
yes of course -- if you would like to go...
I have very little money.
I have a...
No I'm only here on leave.
Oh I see...
Yes I am sir.
Yes it must be.
Well you shall see.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
My mind is made up.
She will not set foot in my house again.
But you can do the same thing in six months.
The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Everything is over between us.
I know of no better time.
Yes of course I would.
nothing at all.
I would like both of you to read this.
Ah that is good.
Oh my darling.
In case of a...
I am such a...
What on earth are you talking about?
But you will not...
I will be there in five minutes.
How should I know.
I know what you're doing in there.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Yes -- what is it?
You are my old friend.
She must have been in love with you.
I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Were they pretty?
Were you in love with any of them?
And you are you in love with any one else?
Do you expect me to believe that?
I thought I was.
Were you in love with him?
Well I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
Yes I'm afraid he is.
yes of course!
I believe so.
Can you give me a drink please?
You mean you heard them making love?
You could hear them?
God help me -- yes.
Do you know what you're saying?
My God what do you think?
What was there to tell?
You wrote it.
Yes I wrote it.
You know that...
Do you understand?!
What the hell is the matter with you?
You mean about my wife?!
There are some things...
Now just a minute.
That's all I can say.
That's all you can say?
but first can I say something to you as a friend?
All right thank you.
Please ask him to come here.
I'm sorry I thought he would give it to you.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would and would give it to you.
Why did you give it to him?
I asked for it yesterday.
Yes yes please sit down.
I will be with you in a moment.
I believe you sent for me.
before you left?
Oh no I am very happy.
I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.
And I know nothing about men.
I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
You are so good to me.
Of course my dear.
Yes I do -- very much.
Do you like music?
Oh then you are...
Yes he has.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Now will you please come down at once.
Have you come to join us?
Show him in.
What did you say his name was?
She would do anything for me.
And I can go free?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Anything you need.
Okay I know what I want this time.
You think they're in there?
Thought he was with you.
But as soon as I got my check I was gone.
Well let me in.
But check this out.
Your my family and I love you.
Boy you looking good.
I got something to show you.
You know me?
Alright I'll remember that.
Can I look for myself?
I think he went out the back.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Well get along with this one.
What about the dog?
It's about to work just come on.
Come on Day try it.
Yeah it is...
the best day before the weekend.
That's how I like 'em.
I'm gone.
What you mean talk to her?
Whatever you say man.
Just take it all.
They're right there in the back.
If you say another word it's over.
I'm not playing!
I said shut up!
Now who sent you?
Man Day-Day is my people!
Probably next Friday.
No man just wait.
Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I saw where they put it.
What you see?
Wait for what?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
You go first.
It is easy.
Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
But I just say we go take a look.
How you know?
Sorry about today man.
Out the door and to the left.
You better stop running from that girl.
You already in.
Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
How can they do this?
Yeah that's why I walked down here.
You know what this is?
What you mean so?
We moved out here to get away from that shit.
I thought the same thing.
Yo know what?
That's the sister.
Who is that?
Where the hell you meet this girl?
Man it's a long story.
Saying I'm the daddy!
Yeah I'm alright.
I know be still.
Oh yeah where you work at?
Go on and make yourself at home.
Thanks I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
This my baby.
We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.
Must be nice.
Yeah that's me.
I know we had a good time.
Next time page me first.
Let's make'em wait.
Easier said than done.
Most of it.
I just hate to see you in this situation.
You did all this for me?
I just wanted to give you this.
They're big boys.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.
Hell yeah I remember you.
Hello remember me?
Oh yeah why you walking?

What team you play for?
I said hold on!
Back in the day all I had was a stick.
Have you seen Day-Day?
You coming in?
It's about this...
Here I come!
Nice to meet you?
See you later Day-Day.
Well then it's all good.
but where's the cover?
Thanks for the dog and the money.
What that mean?
Ya'll live around here?
Why did he go in the house?
I'm about to go home.
Try an' hold it man.
Are you out your mind?
I can take the little one.
Let it go!
Are they still out there?
Get the phone.
What it say?
Yeah it was.
How you get up here?
I feel you.
I thought that was it.
You feel me?
Why would he take it?
Both of you right now!
Alright no problem.
Hey how you get out of here.
Good let's get out.
You too big.
If you shut up I'll tell you.
Take your car.
What you want?
Now get out of here.
I'll take you later.
Well we better hit the road too.
Need to lose some weight.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.
Make sure you look after my son out here.
Come on baby let's go in the house.
But take it easy on me girl.
I thought this was you.
Okay okay that's enough.
I've been a bad boy.
But I want to make some changes.
All right I'll do it.
What happened here?
A big problem...
More opportunity there?
It's hard to make a living in this town.
Do you know where that is?
Where to sir?
No that's...
We'll be just fine.
I'll get a car to drive you.
Try to get out of it.
What have you got to lose?
There's only one way to find out for sure.
I said I'd listen to you not necessarily believe you.
What the hell are you saying?
And your husband works for somebody else.
The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
I remember you...
Only you can help me.
I'm also sorry to say my problem is your problem Mrs.
I have a problem.
I wish everything were that easy.
wanted me to...
What can I do for you Mr....
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Forget about it.
Let me talk to her again.
twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
That gives you...
That's not my problem Mr.
How am I supposed to get away?
Do you now Mr.
I'm not stupid..
I know how this is supposed to work.
Then I put two more into him just to make sure.
Tell me why he's dead.
How should I...?
Tell me why.
Tell me why I miss him.
What would you do in my place?
Then I have time for a drink.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
Where did you get these?
Unless you do what you're told.
Go do it!
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Look at your watch.
Look at it!
At one-thirty your little girl is dead.
Say it with me.
At one-thirty my little girl is dead.
Yes you will Mr.
I will do no such thing.
What's your point?
That's right near here.
Yes I'm listening.
Yes yes I understand.
These are our friends.
She's good with kids.
I'll take the girl.
I'll take the girl!
I'd like to know what...
Come with us sir.
Is this about those kids?
Look I'm sorry about that.
It's her husband.
I think you better put that away.
You asked me for help.
Let me help.
We'll take care of him.
She's only six.
She's just a little girl.
They're the best.
They're hand- picked.
They're in on it.
All right let's just...
unless you can help me.
No that's..
that's fine
He's doing it for you.
But I want you to remember something for me all right?
Not just yet baby.
there's something Daddy has to do.
He has to say ""over and out"".
Daddy you have to say ""over and out"".
Yes I can hear you.
I can hear you good.
So come on.
I want you to stay right by me.
Will you do that for me?
There's nothing more you can do.
Thanks for trying.
It'll come to you.
What am I supposed to say to her?
Yeah now listen.
You go down get yourself something to drink.
Yeah all right listen...
It's about time I did.
That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
I've got to...
do right by my little girl.
No way there's nothing you can do to help me.
If I could just talk to her...
One of them is in on it.
What am I supposed to do about this situation?
There was a woman.
She was trying to help me.
You want change?
You got it brother.
What was that you gave me a twenty?
The end of the world?
When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
You remember me?
Go down past the bar.
Take you right out there.
It's a twenty.
Is within himself.
I said I have to do something.
You have to speak up.
I have to do something.
Oh we'll have to do better than that.
It's already done.
I've already done it.
You have to pay me now.
Now get the hell out of here!
Could I see it?
It looks real.
Well is it real?
Do we know anything about it?
You ask too many questions.
I've got something for you.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby.
Not far at all.
I'll show you.
I've done much better ones than this.
And you can listen to it without anybody else listening.
Let's try it out.
Everybody has their own radio.
It's time now.
I told you I've got it under control.
Somebody mind telling me...
) What the hell happened!?
It better be.
It's under control.
You got this under control?
Just put her on.
Put her on.
Only you can help her.
Look at 'em.
He'd do anything for her.
I'm looking for them.
What do you figure he done with it?
He never told about the money.
You got common sense.
Not even her?
Listen to me son.
Here they come.
Listen to me John.
Come again -- any time.
And the times that are gone by.
Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
One two three four five...
And the Lord told that man --
I'm good for something in this old world and I know it too!
They been gone a week!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
What can we do Mother?
All to pieces!
Is he hit pretty bad?
He's in there.
What's wrong Mother?
Mother I only --
All of it!
Get along with you.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!
There's something else.
It's silly but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
The Lord meant that job for two!
I'll tend to them.
Just look at you!
Oh I know how you tried!
I tried to save her.
My dear dear friends!
Whatever would I do without you!
That's Daddy!
No that's just it.
I want to go upstairs.
Yes I reckon that's it.
To see Dad?
It's all here.
I was just playing with it!
Now can I tell?
Just a man.
The Blue Men?
Tell me a story John.
What's so hard about that!
I'll make coffee.
Maybe there was!
I mind you said there was two.
Why what story?
You-all have your work cut out!
Come to me boy!
Now where boy?
Why sure boy sure.
All right boy: where's the money?
I'll tell.
Have a heart boy.
Come on children!
What's that you're playing with boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
What are you doing boy?
Tell me what boy?
You think you can make me tell!
Did you hear what I said son?
But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Can I have milk too?
John's bad.
Yes; John's bad.
Then I reckon I'll have to try again!
I'm five.
Now it's your turn.
And do you know what your Daddy said to me?
What's their names?
No one never did.
I'd like to talk to you my dear.
She'll not be back.
Why stay and take care of them little kids.
What do you figure to do?
She turned me out of the bed.
The first night?
Yes; from the first night.
I -- no I --
I thought maybe --
Well John the night before your father died he told me what he did with that money.
Do you boy?
What are you after them for?
What's wrong John?
What a day is this!
-- And there's little John!
The Lord will provide.
She took them kids with her?
Where's she at?
Them kids is yours?
What'd you all talk about?
Now who was this?
I been out with men.
When did I ever?
I been bad!
Not this time!
And do you know who he was children?
Oh my god oh my god...
They just died.
It's just made her think...
She was fine before that.
We'll both be right here.
I sure as hell hope so.
Hit him with what?
I can save you the trouble.
How you plan to do that?
Bring him out of what?
Yeah and if he gets me I'm pretty sure you're next.
I know who he is.
They turn their back on it.
It's nothing too hard or anything.
LOOK for someone and...
I want you to be sort of a...
You believe in anything?
Shut up and let me in.
Through the night.
It's just a stupid cat.
We got a fire!
Sure okay I'll be there.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him baby.
You know he's dead though right?
Dad -- what you doing here?
Just want to talk to him a second.
Decide to take a day off after all?
You used me daddy!
Get outside and watch her house.
If you see anything funny call me.
Tell her I'm not here tell her...
She lived there.
What the hell was she doing there?
How you know that?
Had to've done it.
No one else was in there.
In our own house?
I do want to know.
I've got to know!
Dead and gone.
You need anything just call.
And no school tomorrow either.
It happens all the time.
Get into bed.
Right home after.
I'd rather keep busy you know?
Do you think I did it?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
And then what happened?
Someone else was there.
We should get her out of here...
We got her mother's bed.
You two got the rest.
Then he walked out through the wall on the other side.
Like he'd just come to check me out...
Nice to have a fire.
You feel better now right?
Came to make up no big deal.
What the hell you doing here?
How is he?...
Come tell us...
how is he?
Bring me forty-five back.
Have you any money?
You can have it for good.
You want this?
Would it be asking too much...
You feel it though.
No my dear it is true.
That's how they live in the other world.
What do you wear in the morning?
As beautiful as that?
Come tell me.
It was very silly....
what else did you have?
Did you bring back anything else?
You know how it is today...
A few friends...
just a little dinner party.
but my feet are happy.
Not bad at all.
That's another thing...
I can tell you exactly.
No that's not him...
He's a bad man.
No that's bad management.
We can say whatever we want.
Let's forget the future...
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Just see how happy the people look...
She's right...
What a lovely room you have here.
and we might as well face it.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
What she said about us...!
That must be the one!
It must have been here all day!
But what can we do?...
We have to accept.
Why should you be afraid?
Who gave you this idea?
we are making friends.
Shall we tell her?
How will it end?
What will happen to you?
there will be enough.
Let's not close our eyes.
There are many good things to see here too.
Now I know why.
They are very expensive here.
Which part of the room is mine?
I hope you like it.
that's too much for any mother.
Why are you so good to us?
Why should you bother?
I'll write it for you.
what is in your mind?
that is really too much for me.
it should be set to music!
Eight forty-two sir.
Go to bed.
Are they indeed?
They are very interested in the case.
it is in the air...
it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
people will eat and love it.
That was our idea when we first came.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
Well I think it's getting late.
Let's do that.
While you eat you look at the view.
This is a fine thing.
Maybe we've missed him already.
It is Thursday!
What is it my boy?
I give you my word!
We can wait.
Go in there and ring three times.
let's go in.
Let's be honest.
What did she say about me?
I just said let's have a little lunch.
Oh no no.
All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
But how will she look?
What can she say?
All is not lost.
You may have a chance.
how about a little lunch?
If you want to see us you must come later.
You were sent here to make money not to spend it.
Just three people in a room this size?
Only myself and two other girls.
that's right.
Come now you must not talk that way....
How much does this cost?
Present me to your colleagues.
That's even better.
Just looking around.
Well boys I'd like to help you but what can I do?
I want to be fair.
We may have a chance.
We will get that...
we'll get everything...
Just as good.
And it's great!
Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Just look out of the window and there it is.
Well we're back home.
No not a thing.
Would you like to go out?
If there is anything we can do for you...
Oh yes Power and Light.
I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
He wants to carry them.
We are here for work...
all of us.
Well there's nothing we can do about it.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
The other day I heard such a funny story...
It is very funny.
You want me to go in there?
That's the trouble with you!
Why should I take a chance?
Now look here...
Nobody has the right....
I must get into that country of yours!
I want to see a friend of mine...
a very dear friend....
I think so too.
But you had!
What's the real reason?
look at me...
I've been back twice.
Trying to keep me away from you!
Darling I had to see you.
I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
So -- you're behind all this.
People of the world!
but not yet please...
Let us be happy...
give us our moment....
It is their wish.
I give them back to the people...
Let me put it on you.
For the first time they will learn how they can look.
There they are...
But I can throw it out of the window.
There it is...
No no music.
you have to give it a chance...
just like people...
like you and me...
Well then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
all by ourselves.
No no news.
What shall we get?
it must be somewhere around here...
What is radio?
Let's turn on the radio.
Now let's have some music.
I am so happy.
just a house house...
let's form our own party.
All right we'll make it red.
Not white darling.
a little white house.
Nobody will find us.
I am People!
Oh everything is so wonderful!
Something is the matter.
You must darling.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
I'll tell you another story a much better one.
There will be no Thursday for us.
Not next week or any week.
Is that a good story?
They met on the street.
A funny story?
There have been cases...
It's funny to look back.
or an evening.
That's all that interested me then.
Now I would like to know...
what happened to the woman?
Did you make any change in this room?
I know they're not funny they're silly.
They're stupid.
Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
A wonderful idea!
Then could we have some music?
But he got you here.
Life can be so simple.
I've never been here before.
and here I am.
You remember this room?
you two were meant for each other.
Bring me a cup of coffee.
wait a minute...
Did you get that too?
Did you get that?
It is funny!
Everyone else thinks so!
Well I'll give you one more chance!
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it.
Maybe it's with you!
Now here's a great one...
Well maybe it's not so good.
Let's forget it!
How's this?
"" ""Yes it is says the other, five hundred million.
I wish they had never met.
I have never heard one.
On which boat?
Just a moment...
Now go back.
Then you should go back to your table.
Of the moment in which we are living?
The only moment we really have?
Nothing is worth it.
Must one always be after something?
What are you after?
Just an old man.
After all what are any of us?
I always eat here.
Then how did you get here?
Do you know how?
Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch?
Room service speaking.
before he died.
You know I want to...
It is out of the question.
Let's forget that we ever met.
But one of your friends may be in need of you.
You must answer.
Oh let it ring.
Love is not so simple.
There's nothing wonderful about it.
One hand has met the other hand.
Do you hear that?
Just what you see.
What kind of a girl are you anyway?
I was sixteen.
Did you really?
It's never too late to change.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That's a full-time job.
I'm thirty-five years old.
I will start with you.
Not too big and not too small.
Just look around.
Those are my books and here am I.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
We look at each other.
How about some music?
The day will come when you will be free.
Go to bed little father.
He takes good care of that.
You should not make him work.
I will do my best.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Well let's say I live in it.
So that is your house?
I see a house that looks like any other house.
What a city!
I feel sorry for you.
And thank you for getting me up here.
I've never seen this before.
here we are...
here you are and here I am...
And where are we?
Let me see...
How long does it take a man to land?
Is that thing lost again?...
if you are interested in a view...
Correct me if I am wrong...
You might hold this for me.
It's interesting.
I never gave it a thought before.
How long do we have to wait here?
Could you give me some information?
Has done what?
You're always late.
By about five minutes.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
And I thought it was something serious!
All right I'll listen.
I should have talked to you before.
I understand everything will be over by Thursday.
Stop talking about the good old days.
I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
do you mind if I sit down?
What a woman!
Old or young?
Not with her.
No and believe me I've tried everything!
I asked her to dinner...
seventy-two hours!
I got up and went back...
and then got up again.
These last few days...
there may be a chance...
that's all...
He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money!...
But how can there be a question?...
All right I'll let you know!
it's very important...
please get him right away...
Call the police...
There must be some way of getting them back!
Darling this would be wonderful!
I know exactly what they want.
You will be in a position to give it to me.
Did you win?
However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
I wish I had someone else's face.
possibly a little better.
Leave that worry to me.
That's not the way to win him back...
I may run out of money but you have already run out of bread.
I told you we had plenty to talk about.
Shall we sit down?
That's very simple to answer.
They were given to me by my mother.
You leave me no choice.
I give you my word...
In that case I can only say good-by.
Not if you have their love.
yes you took that away from me.
That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do.
I must ask you to leave.
That's all right...
Now there you are completely wrong.
Please come to the point.
I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best.
Of course not my dear!
It is tomorrow morning...
Not at all....
That's no business...
How can I make myself clear...
let me stay here...
let me finish my work...
Let me finish my work...
Are you sure this report is correct?
May I ask what has happened?
You must have worked day and night....
The future of the common people.
Bring me something simple.
I never think about food.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place.
Your face is new to me.
Now what shall it be?
This will do.
By the window perhaps?
Or a nice little corner table?
Where is that?
Where do you eat?
Thank you so much my friend.
I am sorry...
Do you know what you are saying?
They are here!...
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Did you lose your job?
How do you do my friend.
But sir we'll have to start over from the beginning.
I know what I said.
We could check the tape again sir.
You did say it sir.
How can you let this shit go by!
Sir if I may...
We'll see about that...
Then his office will be fine.
I want a very private conversation.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
let's go...
He should be here any minute.
I understand that, sir.
It's the country John.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do John.
You want me to put it all in writing?
With every day that...
And I'm...
We could get that.
Pardon all of them.
Pay him what he wants.
And he means it.
Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
And eventually, it's either you or him.
I'm one of his people.
That's not the question, John.
The question is: Why is he paying?
I'll bet he would.
I got the money.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
That'll be the day.
Yeah I knew it.
He's the one...
Maybe she'll stay this time.
And what am I supposed to do?
What's so special about me?
Did anyone talk to him?
What about England?
My point exactly!
Where I went to school.
and to the Times.
Well better him than me.
What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Sir there's dead American kids here.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war!
Is the war worth it?
Oh I suppose you would've just let them take over.
How do we pay?
It could be more than that.
I told him to get out of the country.
I mean has anyone ever done it before?
I like the idea.
How long have we had this fucking dog?!
We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
Keep it out of the White House.
""  This could be trouble.
This could be a set-up.
Through a window?
I know it well sir.
No one will ever find out what's on it.
How do you see this?
And if I stay?
I'm afraid we have another problem Mr.
The hell he will!
Fire him, too.
I'm honest.
Let 'em try!
That's what they're doing.
We've got to take the war to them.
You're all set sir.
Good night Mr.
No sir you did not.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now sir but...
but you need to get out more sir and talk to the people.
close to you.
May I say something Mr.
Also there's June twenty third.
Those are the ones...
When I met with him he said...
It's out of control...
They're not serious about power that's why.
They're playing with power.
Why would they?!
They buy things.
One of the things they buy is the New York Times.
Right now when he's on top.
My God my God!
He talked to the New York Times?
This could be it...
this could be it.
Four long years...
You know they all miss the point.
They're the far left.
And his staff.
We really must go Mr.
We actually agree on a lot of things...
There's more of 'em with you than against you.
Run 'em over.
Jesus they're serious.
Follow the money.
We have to get out in front of this thing.
You never told him?
it had a life of its own.
it was our idea.
Go to the woman's group.
No no not tonight.
I have too much to do.
He'll never figure one out for himself.
Yes sir but...
He'll know what I'm talking about.
Get to it.
We'll work on it.
But what are we paying him for?
What do you mean sir?
I had nothing to do with that.
We could have a problem with that.
There's nothing there!
They did what?!
Is it my turn?
But not me Richard.
I'll never let you down again Mother.
I'll never do it again.
Please Mother it...
it was just one time Mother I'm...
Well then Richard we have nothing more to talk about do we?
come with me would you...
Time to go home.
can I get you anything?
Go to law school.
you'll be able to do it now.
Anything but a talk with her.
Maybe if you talk to Mother she can...
""The Second Coming""?
They make me sick.
But let me tell you there are worse things than death.
But I would never never consider...
His death was awful an awful thing for this country.
Do you ever think of death Mr.
But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that.
And of course I accept.
And I want you to know I work for only one president at a time.
That could take time -- two maybe three years...
You could do the same...
All of them...
Then find something.
Of course we've tried but so far we've come up with nothing that...
You're correct.
and this is what you use him for?
And so shall I.
About me having too much power.
He works in the kitchen.
Yeah you do.
I always get my man.
Who do you think is behind it?
It still is.
We took his system out.
Where are they now?
They've been at it now for a year.
I know you've been very careful not to.
That's why I'm concerned.
I never met the man.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.
Where'd you find him?
Who we working for?
You're fucking me.
They're around.
Remember -- listen up!
The American people put me where I am.
It's change -- which is a fact of history.
I need your support.
They're serious.
He heard me and he made his decision.
She's quite pretty.
We'll see about that.
You have many friends...
And I will tell the world why.
but I'm not stupid either...
They will understand, sir.
When to give and when to take.
As some kind of...
Yes, I suppose it was.
I heard something...
This will get me a second term.
There's no history.
Exactly, yes, Mr.
-- even my own men.
What I think is...
There's no other choice.
and what do we get for it?
He must be stopped at all costs.
He was he was.
They started the war; it makes them look bad.
All those kids...
Why do they hate me so much?
That was Mr.
The real war is in us.
I must say you look very good Mr.
He's on the top of the list.
Free if you're the president.
You just came down here for the weather right Mr.
Get off that.
That was a long time ago.
but I feel too much sometimes.
How do you know that John?
Did we try?
Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?
They'll never buy it.
What the hell -- I love her.
And she's great in bed.
How the hell can you put up with her John?
It's a thing she does.
He was their kind.
""  I really think that's what has to be done.
Can you back me up on this?
Use his women.
but it was all we had.
But it was all we had.
You all know me.
That man up there lived in similar times.
What you have to understand Mr.
Where you from?
She might remember me...
Oh yeah he's good.
music do you like?
I mean what kind of clothes do you like?
Do you like blue...
she really is...
I believe I can control it.
Maybe not control it totally.
Then what's the point?
What's the point of being president?
Or even what I want...
Someone wants it...
Even if you wanted to.
You're full of shit!
What good was his death?
Yes I understand that.
We came here to end the war.
Good Lord have you lost your mind?
there's more than just me.
So I'm supposed to be...
What I know about this country, I...
No, they want you, Mr.
I really think it would be a good move.
The hell with 'em.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
We're back!
We got the press this time!
There'll be time for that.
If I could just...
It'll be over soon.
They're not yours.
They are you.
They were for me.
They're mine.
You had to make a record...
for the whole world.
Does it matter what's on them?
Or just me and you and...
I'm finished trying.
And what am I doing?
What' you're doing --
and I have to see this through.
Mother would've wanted no less of me...
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
This is about me.
Do you want that?
It's not pretty.
In my own way.
You have no reason to...
You have everything you ever wanted.
Yes it's been a long time...
Yeah sure a long time ago.
Just the two of us.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Then I'll be there for you.
you know it!
And then you'll be happy?
I need you out there.
I can win...
Nobody knows better than you.
They need you too.
Were you planning to tell me?
They've lost a brother.
It's his way.
Then call him.
I'll never run again.
If I stop...
We can be happy.
We really can.
The girls and I...
just look at me.
That's what you said the first time we met.
I'm political.
And you're political too!
If we stay with you you'll take us down with you.
This is our life.
They only know you from television anyway.
What about the girls?
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?
But I miss him.
I miss him a hell of a lot.
Maybe I should get out of the game.
You know I keep thinking of my old man tonight.
And it's enough that we know.
Just think of the girls.
They're still young.
We never see them.
I lost my parents.
We worked for it.
It's hard to lose...
Well that's wonderful.
You should know better.
Call it three-and-a-half maybe four...
You know a book.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Won or lost?
Never made so much money in my life.
Well you're obviously making him happy.
You remember him.
This country is hard on people.
Believe it was that night.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house.
As they say.
I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way.
Want a cup?
Got a letter from your wife.
I am older.
I got to say you look older.
Depends what you mean by got.
How many a those things you got now?
Once you walked in.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
What give you that idea.
How'd you know I was here.
Hard to believe.
He's real all right.
Well what would you call him.
It may be that.
Try old"" on for size.
Not the one thing.
It is not the one thing.
What is it mean?
Couple hundred on his person.
No money in his room there?
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
And he needs help whether he knows it or not.
He never thinks he needs any.
it's certainly true that it is a story.
He never has.
Some pretty bad people.
Who's he in trouble with then?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Would you tell me if you had?
Not word one.
No that's the only thing I would've looked for.
There's a question.
He ought to...
So when was he here?
Probably must be.
Believe you're right.
What about yours?
You know: might not of even been no money.
That's the boy.
Oh I'm more than sure.
But then there's this other.
I'd say it is.
It may come to three times before it's over...
I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Two of 'em.
Both had my father.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well you got time for 'em now.
I mean would you care to join me.
What do you think.
I never do.
I always am.
That's very nice.
Well I put it in.
You just set there.
Three years ago I said them very words.
No and Good.
Not like you say.
To your husband.
You gave your word?
But I gave my word.
I need to sit down.
She'll be all right?
She'll be all right.
What am I supposed to do with Mother?
This works better.
After I find him I'll come and join you.
What did I know to tell him.
What did you tell him?
You should be used to that.
Well I got  a good one.
So they ought to even out.
I'll call you in a couple days.
for how long do we have to...
Well -- how come?
Not we you.
Stay with your mother.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Just keep it up.
I need to know that.
What'd you give for that thing?
It's full a money.
I mean the nature of you.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Twenty minutes it could be here.
And where is that.
What's that.
I know something better.
To get it.
If you knew you would have it with you.
I know where the money is.
Why would I let you do that?
I could just go home.
You expect him?
Did you not hear me?
Well I'd say he's at work.
Brother I been there...
How'd you find it?
You getting anything on this?
What's this about?
I've decided to make you a special project of mine.
I think you do too.
You bring me the money and I'll let her go.
The same as you.
I think that you do.
You need to talk to me.
the more people looking...
Which it is.
Where you want me to put it?
It's your lucky quarter.
You stand to win everything.
I got to know what I stand to win.
Nineteen fifty-eight.
And now it's here.
You been putting it up your whole life.
You need to call it.
Just call it.
You ever lost.
We come out here about four years ago.
This was my wife's father's place.
You've lived here all your life?
I need to close now --
You said that.
I could come back then.
I'd say around nine-thirty.
Somewhere around nine-thirty.
I said what time do you go to bed.
What time do you go to bed.
Now is not a time.
What time do you close.
We close now.
What time do you close?
You already asked me that.
Will there be anything else?
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?
What way would that be?
And the gas.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
I need everything else.
You on all night?
One room one night.
Let me have that one.
You can stand up in it.
Well some people could stand up in it.
You might just could.
Just drive me around.
I want to see if someone's here.
You seem pretty sure of yourself.
We can stop that.
That's not an answer.
You seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?
When did you last see him.
I know 'em when I see 'em.
I do like you.
Then you'll like me.
What else then?
No one forty-two.
You can have the one next to yours if you want.
What about one forty-two.
No I want to keep my room and get another one.
Could I get another room.
I'm just one person.
He's not like you.
He's not even like me.
Call me when you've had enough.
I can even let you keep a little of the money.
You're not cut out for this.
You need to give me the money.
So what does that make me?
Any of it.
Took me about three hours.
Not any way.
Not that way.
I know how he found me.
You know how he found you?
I know I've seen him.
I'm not the man that's after you.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
I ask questions.
And how do I decide?
You do I reckon.
Well you should find out.
I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.
Sorry you had to see that.
Could I have that in American?
I got some questions for you about...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW!
I'M NOT COMING BACK!
WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Did he do something stupid?
I meant your food.
How's everything?
I say we wait...
Let's wait for the real police...
YOU shut up!
They're beautiful but get them some water.
I know plenty.
Now I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing but...
what else do you know?
Any idea where it is?
Just shut up a second and listen...
And what about my fish?
Who is taking care of them?
That's a nice name for what you need...
Why do I need to see this?
Did he ask you to...?
Tell him what you told me.
Do I have to hear this now?
What the hell do you want?...
He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
she's on the run.
One question, Doctor, please!
YOU'RE GONE!
A woman can write a check.
Anyway, so what?
Did you send anyone out there?
You think a woman did that?!
Yes it was.
No, it's nothing, I...
Okay, let's go...
I got nothing for the record yet.
You should get the order you want.
Yeah, it was great.
Oh yeah he's got things up and running alright...
They're fine...
you miss it?
No I was just...
Need something else?
So all this...
what're you saying?
I'd rather not...
I better go check on them.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
WAIT A SECOND!
I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE!
YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
That's my son!
My son is dead!
Yes but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I wrote that when I was twelve...
where'd you get that?!
Here listen to this...
""If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day I know they will be friends.
"" Now that's beautiful.
I'm not really who you think I am.
so what do you think?
Let me get this out.
You'd never have to work again that's for sure.
You could probably have any thing you wanted...
I never meet people like you.
you're different.
to see you.
it was always something.
I've got a pretty good idea.
You want me to be afraid but I'm not.
Do you know why I'm here?
I know what you are.
No just stand there...
Oh this is wonderful...
Oh and one more thing about what you did yesterday...
You can start tomorrow.
Is that issue?
Is that totally clear?
Of course he's only here two days a week.
Well I certainly would have heard about that.
You must know him.
He was set up.
I left so quick but I need to do this.
Well you are.
All the time...
All you been through...
I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Let me know if you need anything okay?
Oh I wish we could just get in it and drive and drive and drive!
No we'll do it later.
'S only a birthday right?
I'll have another one next year...
Maybe next week we could...
what about your sister?
Did you watch it yet?
You were saying...
something about how stupid you've been?
I'll leave.
You're doing this now?
After all the...
are you sick?
I mean what am I...
why am I here?
But I'm David...
I mean I'm not David but she thinks I am!
You heard her...
Who put you up to this?
What did I do to you...
Why am I doing this to you?
maybe it was.
You know I almost believe that...
but I love listening to you so that's okay...
Yeah I felt that way too when I first started but now...
I just hope it's not too late for me.
Listen to me ""Me me me.
Let's talk about you...
what do you think about me?
I know that's why we were meant to be together...
Like my place.
It's up to us.
I know how much you want this.
it's not up to me.
Listen we need to take a time out here.
What happened when you were twelve?
You told me that two hours ago.
She's a good person to know.
Yes, she is.
You never gave us a chance...
There was no plan!
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it.
He never told me anything about...
We went to school together.
He could talk anyone into anything.
But I'm the one who's sorry.
But it's behind me now...
And I hope you can put it behind you.
I've missed you...
I take it I should.
of course you do.
You should remember where you came from.
And who you really are.
So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I came for love...
What'd you come here for?
They're new to us...
Oh, I know.
All right, then.
I'll see you when I get home.
What's so special about it?
Oh, you're there.
Hang on a second there, baby.
So, call me when you --
I think there might be...
Was it anyone that you...?
did you get a look at who did it?
Sure, I saw the whole thing.
It's no problem...
Oh, nothing, it's fine.
You're looking good...
It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
You made out alright.
I'll go to the Hospital.
What's his real name?
I left my husband two days ago.
That's horrible!
Did you love it?
Everybody told me not to go.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?
So you're into Reason too?
What's the matter here?
No, no, no.
We know all that.
What happened with you?
What do you mean you wrote it?
I wrote it...
I'm just starting to remember it now.
That you had something to do with it?
I was right there...
I have to leave now.
I need to...
Oh, he does that.
Half the people who know him call him George.
Well what if this guy's just playing with you?
No almost never.
Do you always get what you want?
I have lots of times.
I'd never been in a place like that before.
With a view of the whole world?
So where'd you go?
So what'd you talk about?
He is real.
Does he know you think he's real?
You still in love?
Were you with him this whole time?
You never know who you'll see.
Looking for someone?
What are those for?
Can we be friends?
I come home you go to your room.
You go in the kitchen I go to my room.
But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
HE IS REAL!!
I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!
Is this about gas money?
I should have been here at the hospital with my brother but I was with you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Which one is it?!
Cut the shit will you!
Where was he?!
I was talking about what you could wear!
How many men have I talked to?
"" This is my phone number!
How many of these have you given out?
I see it at my company all day long!
One of us should.
You're making this up...
They never did find her head...
God that's awful!
He has a wife?!
I know what you mean I recently had some trouble with a man a different man...
You made it!
Hey that looks great on you.
So how'd it go today?
You find him?
We're still on for tonight right?
It's lovely...
No this one was worse...
The one you were telling me about?
You can go get your stuff right now.
I'll walk you down.
Man that is love.
' That's your guy.
It's something I had to do.
I came for love.
LISTEN TO ME!
I saw it done once.
I've made my decision.
No that should be more than --
More than you know.
That would be the right word.
They did horrible things to men there...
And where was that old man?
You know it's interesting.
Oh Jesus please...
Well my idea of stupid is very different from yours.
So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing.
Could you give us an example?
It's a small town, man.
People here think small.
They act small.
What's to like?
It's a nice place you got here.
You like it here?
You got five...
If we're for real?
I need to know if you're for real.
my wife's.
I like this.
I like doing business in the home.
Who's birthday?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
You're a hundred percent right.
We could do that.
You made your point...
yeah, I got it.
That'd make her...
That's the same guy!!
What in the...
All this fucking time!
A doctor on the show...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Wait wait wait a minute...
I should have known it all along.
So first thing we...
I'm not telling.
where she's been anyway.
Are you an American?
Do you hear yourself right now...?
This one's got to be her.
We should go.
Why is she doing this to me?
I'd just love to know...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You're like me.
I've always tried to do what's right.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
There it is again.
WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!!
They paid us half.
They said find it.
Find her, find it.
Finish the job you were paid to do.
Do her right here.
"" Let's just see what happens okay?
He said they'll be here...
What time're they coming?
You should read more.
I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her.
I know I am.
I hope you're right...
And now this.
This was supposed to be my last job.
How can you eat at a time like this?
What the hell was that another statement?
We can live with that.
I like 'em small.
It's the only statement you need to make.
They get in they get out.
Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I wanted to make a statement.
It's not here.
That one look you got!
I thought you were done so I took him out...
You gave me a look!
This is great -- just great!
That was to get him to talk!
Get rid of that thing will you?
You told me how to do it!
IT SURE IS!!
So you see we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not.
Now that's really stupid.
That is so right.
You better give me another example.
Your wife's a very lovely woman.
Have I seen her before?
you got a fine one right here!
Just one more thing...
I'm sorry about what happened and all but that's the way I feel about all of this...
But she wanted more out of life right?
no not quite.
you two in high school together?
Oh five years give or take.
and how long did she work here?
He's waiting...
Seems like a nice place.
What'd you get her?
Then do as you're told.
Get her back.
That's not a bad idea.
Why would I give a shit how you feel.
I'm the one who...
You saw what happened.
I SAID FORGET IT!
SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Let me try this!
All right everybody!
That's ten minutes!
No problem there is no...
What is the problem?
Just do that...
Is there a problem George?
If you need a minute that's okay.
But I thought you'd want to --
You know throw you into it...
just like you.
I said I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television!
We know that...
I know George I was there.
Yeah bring your friend along.
Funny that's just what I was thinking...
You're better than most of them anyway...
She really that good-looking in person?
But after her mother died...
Why you know him?
Names a phone number something...
Places like this just make you small...
I should have never come back here after college.
She's probably dead too.
You mean like the guy on ""A Reason to Love?
I'm not sure now.
I never heard of it.
where's he out of?
We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy.
I heard from her.
Do you have yesterday's show on tape by any chance?
""A Reason to Love.
And what do I sell?
Hang on there -
Well he'll have to wait his turn -
End of the road boys.
Good Lord what do we do?
we're the next act...
Now what in the...
Well that's right!
Hit by a train!
You ever been with a woman?
Not that I'm aware.
Yeah look at me.
Come on in boys the water's fine!
MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
I hate fire!
Not out the other side his face though.
In any state.
Well we need that ring.
That's not my ring.
And you were right about that ring.
You said you'd changed!
Hell now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Hell you're best men!
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow!
No - you stop it!
What're you?
Your daddy was hit by a train.
Eighty-four years old!
I'll be eighty-four years old.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Million point two.
Thank you anyway.
For him not for the law!
How's this a plan?
The hell you say!
Well that all depends.
These boys're a hit!
Maybe we should get us some.
Hear me boys?
That's over with.
I knew you'd make it!
Where's your girl?
What did you call her?
Okay I wrote those things...
I never said any of that!
Not every week...
That's not how she told it.
She said you wrote her every week you were away.
you never want to talk about that man and it's important.
That what she was...
Yeah I sort of thought so myself.
Hey what did you want?
Well I'll see you.
It just came to me.
I'm only a couple hours away.
I would've come.
Yeah I made some money down there then I talked my way into another college and I did it.
You should've called!
Thank you sir!
I'll find me another place.
I'm not finished.
This is where I live.
They take care of you okay?
Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.
but right here!
Go for the record!
I'll do it myself!
Dog eat dog down to the last one right?
Hey did you hear?
Good morning girls.
You can go in my place.
When did this happen?
Come over here where I can see you.
And thank you.
Get on your feet and find out how good sir.
And so are you!
It's important sir!
It'll have to wait.
's were supposed to help you in this place!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
That's not true sir!
I've changed a lot since I've been here!
That's no reason.
Sir that's not true!
I love my country!
I mean in life.
I'm doing okay sir.
I know about your mother.
I've seen your college record.
I've never heard of most of those schools.
This is really wonder work.
Not exactly sir.
Which one are you boy?
Where are you from boy?
Is that what you think I am boy?
What did you call me boy?
I know why most of you are here.
We're not stupid.
Lot of things can happen in six year.
Another war could come up in six years.
Now when I say ""understand"" I want the whole group to say ""Yes sir!
Yes I do!
Did you let that boy --
I said come here!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry but Mrs.
I got my period this morning.
In a couple of years I'll be floor manager.
but what would we do?
Where would we go?
I had to baby...
Oh it's beautiful!
I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
I'd want to be with you through the whole thing...
by your side.
My responsibility as its father for one.
do the right thing.
There's a lot more to it than that.
Just suppose it.
I'm a little late that's all.
Then I'll see you around.
Or we could do that yeah.
What would you girls like to do?
Want to stick around here for a little or...
or could I suggest another plan...?
You're sure it's okay?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Mind if we talked about something else?
I had a big brother who died over there too.
Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it so I know I can.
for my people...
You're just the same!
Already come and gone.
How can you win?
I never feel like that.
I never used to think I'd do something like that but now I'm not so sure.
You serious about having him over?
He'll show.
He ask you out for next weekend?
But in what ways?
Everything was different.
Did he do anything that was different?
I got my foot on the floor.
Yeah I saw 'em.
Far fucking out!
One more minute.
Of course there was a baby.
That's all I want to know!
And you turned him down??
I had my period.
What did you tell him about the baby?
Will you do that for me please.
I've never seen anything like that in my whole life!
That's brilliant.
I bet you do!
You got the whole story just right.
Or the class before that!
Please stop it.
None of that's true.
I'd like to come with you.
Why'd he do it?
Well thanks again for dinner.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Twenty-two years ago.
Your real father?
Are those for me?
When I'm good and ready.
Hey what about Sunday dinner?
All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head.
Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
The thing that really got to me...
I'll get it if you want.
It sure was.
That was great.
I've never had a girl.
Do you say something or do you just...
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
I know who you are and what you want.
so if even in the back of your --
And if you ask me you got no chance at all of being an officer!
Be a friend.
Just get out of here.
Where's that coming from?
Okay come here.
Take your clothes off.
There's always a choice.
I should've walked.
Now I remember.
I've been looking forward to this all week.
See yourself making it.
It'll happen.
I work for National Paper.
I make eight-twenty-three an hour.
Why're you here?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
No and I'm not looking for one either.
You got a girl?
We've lived all over the world.
That's how he put it.
All week long.
You'd make it.
He's just getting to the girls.
I came to him on my own.
I really mean that.
He was right.
The best friend to everybody!
Just like that it's all over?
With less than two weeks to go you're out?
I felt like...
Is everything your responsibility?
Do you know that for sure?
Girls do that all the time.
She said it was up to me.
Get her to a doctor.
She seen a doctor?
Talk to me in the morning.
I feel like shit.
You should've done what I did.
You love this...
My girl back home.
I should've told you about her.
That's what they want you to think but I saw where she lived what is she's trying to get away from.
Break it off now.
Do it this week.
They're just having a good time same as us.
Those are the girls he was talking about.
It's time to walk away.
You want to know how many times we did it?
I hope she comes.
Can you believe it!
Could you believe those girls!
Not if you make it worth my while.
I've seen better.
NOT THAT ONE?!
The other two when we come out.
Buy one you get the rest for the same price.
Then we finish.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Look look look she's telling us.
Half an hour.
The hell does she want?
Yeah I got an idea.
You got an idea?
Then you end up like him.
You're full of ideas.
Get us into that room.
You should see the look on your face.
She'll get the point.
He said open it.
Make her come out.
Fine we'll help 'em.
Once they come out of that room.
Who else but God could think this shit up?
There is not one thing funny here.
Not with me.
Not with people.
Little piece of it anyway it's better than nothing.
Hey man after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Jesus what was I thinking?
And we're never getting in.
She's never coming out.
We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes forty-five fucking minutes!
She said she did.
Things get worse when you think.
Shut up and let me think.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
But for once in my life I had a good idea and I'm not giving up so easy.
One more hand.
Not if we keep 'em here.
Or something like that I'm pretty sure.
It's still a good plan.
I've never seen him before.
Forty-five minutes.
That's all you said you need.
That's like nothing.
We're okay here.
We can do this right?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
That's all you need to know.
Who is this guy?
I mean right?
Fourteen business days.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
They're not supposed to be here!
""  What was the rest?
Oh that phone call...
Your husband says you said ""There are three...
"" right before you got cut off.
Stop asking me that.
Who called you?
We'd like to come in.
Somebody called you?
Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?
I think not!
Oh I've seen these...
Could the child please stop that?
I said open the door.
Will they take asking price?
The hell we are.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.
And he's your problem.
No fucking way.
Wait a minute wait a minute.
I told you on the phone I have to be moved in in two weeks.
How many more do we have after this?
Or we could wait for the car...
What if I do?
I was trying not to tell you...
He's just across the park this is why we got places so close to each other in case we needed each other we're still a family he'll help us...
What would you think in the middle of the night?
He'll call the police.
He'll know we're in trouble.
He heard me I said ""There are three...
He'll do something.
I saw something I saw...
Not in the bedroom.
Yeah but where's the third guy?
We're never getting out of here.
Come on come on...
On the floor!
Get on the floor!
What what what is it?!
YOU HAVE TO!
YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
What am I a five year old?
We're not coming out.
Get out of my house.
""What we want is in that room.
What if they get in here?
In the house.
The phone works.
Well I know that now.
You know what they were trying to do here.
I with it sister but...
For the last time Boy!!!
What are doing with yours?.
You know it brother.
I'll go you stay.
We're not even two hundred strong yet...
What's up man?
We're back where we started.
WHAT DO WE WANT?
Hold up a second...
We got a decision to make.
Could you come in here please?
Look just go.
We all lost.
This is bigger than you and me.
it's over.
Just run away.
it's gone.
what the hell you doing?
That make you happy??!!
like your man says ""By any means necessary.
Do you fucking understand?
I want you to set 'em up...
Get out of the fucking car.
Get out of the car.
Are you fucking with me?
whatever you say.
Remember you're working for us.
I expect to hear from you soon.
What the hell!!!
you stay away...
Oh shit man...
who did this to you.
Brother where you been?
Yeah it was alright.
Not yet one of these day's maybe.
Political Education's really his bag.
Yeah only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
"" Just like old times.
Party needs the bread.
Hey this what they got you doing now?
Look around man.
Check it out...
Man I'm with that...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
One might say...
this is no good...
As far as Mr.
Now I'm finished.
"" Two: ""We want full employment for our people.
That would be an excellent start.
You want me to put a man on it?
They actually think they're for real.
Can you make a deal with them?
How can I be of help?
Show that there's some common ground between Black and White.
You all with that?
I'm not sure now's the time.
Yes sir I was.
Yes that's exactly what I mean.
We're working on that...
Not good enough at all.
can we deal with this tomorrow...
Alright I'll stay.
What's this world coming to?
You're probably not the only one they've gone after.
We need money first...
We'll get them.
Power to the people baby...
That's right brother...
listen and learn.
No you wait a second.
Two you change your name.
Wait a second there brother...
No thank you sister.
That seems a little light.
Me too while you're at it.
How many men you got?
Yeah well they want a lot for their money.
"" We've got to give them something.
You alright with this?
Yours mine all of it.
Outside and in.
You got to do something for me.
You're what the Party needs.
This was a good day...
Whatever you need I'll be there.
Mind if I ask you something?
Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
a land mine.
Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
You know you're lucky to be back.
Seems like that's what they're there for.
let me think about it.
Someone like you.
So what's the deal?
Later for that.
I'm done either way...
We'll all get out of here together.
take her and get the hell out of here.
I'll keep 'em busy.
No man No!!
I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Pull over at that gas station.
You got something on your mind...
If you got something to say say it.
I wonder why that is?
What you see is what you got.
And who is we?
Well act like it.
He's talking big and living bigger.
well then I got something to do.
Where is he?.
But I'm sure I'll find out.
Just come for the food man.
And then some.
Maybe it's time we tried something else...
They're alright.
There out there trying to do something.
I saw that big one  hit that police man.
I'm very happy for you.
That would be nice too.
That would be nice.
The hell I do.
No he takes after his mother...
You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Am I one of that sort?
You've got a lot to lose.
I expect to try.
I know him well enough?
He's my father.
He's not making light.
I said I'm not my sister.
If you go I'll care for them as if they were my own.
I should have known...
once I would have...
How did this...
how did I let this happen?
As do you.
We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Nineteen if you hang me with my men.
You have eighteen of my men.
I want them back.
Very well let us move on to...
I will do so as soon as possible.
Perhaps I could explain them to you...
I understand sir.
Stay the course.
I see do as I say not as I do.
It was a different time son.
And you're a better man than that.
That seemed to make a difference.
The war went another year things went better...
I'm not my mother.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.
That's not enough.
And what do they know?
They still do sometimes.
Everyone knows what happened.
You know what happened.
Is it her?
It's beautiful there.
Your mother and I were there once before you were born.
Father there's something else I need to talk to you about.
She said that?
Oh my Lord she said that?
As if she had been speaking all along.
Stay the course...
God help us all when you're forty.
You know how old I am.
I've been doing this for two years.
We put out the word.
What now sir?
It's already over.
I have no choice I...
When you have children I hope you'll understand.
I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
There are some letters here from him.
Some are just to you.
I know he did and he's sorry.
He'll come back as soon as he can.
He left us.
Your son what did you name him?
It's not over yet.
It will end one way or another.
And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back.
But there is something you can do to help end all this.
She was with child.
Not me you.
The bigger problem is where not when.
I am I think.
No thank the Lord.
He's more like his mother.
One of yours?
Name five hundred.
you will wait.
That will be all Major.
Yes quite but you should know that...
She's to the west.
Four five miles.
How far away?
Yes he does.
About a hundred and twenty.
Less than a third.
How many came back?
I'm one of that sort.
I heard about your son.
And what is the second thing?
If you give him what he thinks is an out he'll take it.
He was only fifteen.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Put them away.
But father they might come this way.
Put those away.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.
The war could be over by then.
Lots of them.
He can if He wants to.
But I have to keep things ready for him that's what I think.
Is that right dad?
Who might you be little Miss?
Of course I will.
We have to go back!
I'll be there in three days--four at the most.
Come with us daddy.
Please come with us!
She needs you.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
I'm sure you're not.
Well here we are sitting in my chair.
Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
You believe in it.
I think we go on.
Some think we're born again as little children--
She's in bed.
Ever since Mrs.
Is he really all right?
Where'd you hear that?
It seems short.
and that's a very long time.
That's what I think.
I want to look around daddy-- may I?
I'm coming home.
The one that was hit by a car?
How can you call it a good thing?
It's nice to meet you.
But you want to watch out for that road.
I live just across the road.
that sometimes dead is better.
Sometimes dead is better.
That's why they moved on.
I wonder if we could just--
He's your cat now.
God I was sorry to hear.
She got used to the idea.
Why then things should be fine.
Then something happened.
The rest moved on.
Can I have another one?
I'm a doctor.
I know death when I see it and Church was dead.
that's all.
What we done was right.
Another time it might not be but tonight it was...
Now you make your call...
but not a word about tonight.
This time I mean it.
You keep saying that.
It's funny all right.
You'll see before long.
But you got away with it.
Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Give me the cat.
I'll take care of it myself.
Just follow me...
Then come on.
Does she love the cat?
But we can do it...
It's Church.
they'll be back tomorrow night.
Come over here just a minute!
how much further is it?
What's at the end of it?
And since my wife died...
Not always but sometimes.
Hope your time here will be a happy one.
What were you listening to?
God that's fine.
Well maybe I----
Come on over and join me if you want.
Hey--they actually found the place!
That was wrong.
Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
No matter how much you feel you have to.
There's more power here than you know.
It's just that I..
I thought maybe you did.
I heard you tonight.
you know that...
And Church will be fine.
I know what you just said.
I just said--
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Church will be just the same.
It was that place.
Well I've got a million questions about the area and---
Yes--I know.
Where does it go?
Jesus the road!
Aye aye sir!
How does he do that?
You'll get it back.
Or one better.
I need to put together --
I agreed to set them free.
You gave your word!
If you agree...
We got that part.
Enough of that!
What's in your head boy?
Aye for us there is.
Are you up for it?
The situation has changed.
No I really think I do.
No good can come of it.
Set up Mr.
I'll watch my back.
See that's where we're different.
to do what it takes to get what you want.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.
Wait as long as you like.
Oh and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'm supposed to...
Then I tell you who you need.
Oh that's fine.
And just how do you expect this to work?
You have something I want -- more than anything.
But him I believe.
Do you believe him?
Who's got it?
Bring it forward!
Do you not know what this is then?
Would that I could.
Now none of that.
Believe me Miss you'd best hand it over now...
No no nothing like that.
Did you now?
I want you to leave.
And never come back.
That is what we shall do.
You're speaking up for him again?
And behind his back this time.
Yes I'm all right I'm fine!
Did he speak?
About the day we met.
It's -- beautiful.
Is everything all right?
He said you say that!
-- then we never would have met.
If I had known --
To keep it away from them?
Why would my father send this to me?
What's your plan?
and that would be too late.
the company is better than last time.
More to drink!
Have at it.
That was before I met one of course.
it's silly.
it's nothing.
We've got to do something to help him!
you did it before!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
You go on.
That he is.
And you've got that have you?
Something he needs.
Make it last then.
Aye that'll about do it.
That we are.
He never told me that.
All the men in place sir.
Ready to fire.
As likely as not.
This must be some important boat.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
You would do that?
Funny I was thinking along those lines.
How can you pass that up?
We had time to get to know each other.
Ah but you have heard of me.
If you please.
-- and who knows how to get what he wants.
It's the right way.
Are you certain this is the right way?
Just follow me.
It's meant for one man.
These are the only ones worth having.
Shut up before you lose them all!
Just do it quickly.
Put it away Will.
I knew him.
looking for my father.
It's still against the law.
My business Will.
This girl -- what does she mean to you?
We need to go!
I can get you out of here.
So it is that you found a girl.
You need to find yourself a girl.
And I practice with them.
Who makes all these?
Only a little.
Mentioned it is more what he did.
He may be.
Yes I have.
You've seen it?
Where did he come from?
Just watch him.
Until he's done.
How long do you leave him in there?
What did you use?
Well I suppose that depends on you.
Do you know what I see?
There will be no way to stop it.
I made you!
I'll give you anything you want!
I know what you're doing.
You're not like me.
As you can see I am a new man just like you.
If you'd like we can go straight to the authorities.
I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
I can explain it.
I've been waiting for that for years.
What I asked you earlier?
Then you still love me?
Yes of course it is.
Look at my body.
I've done everything changed anything you asked me to.
'  Is that still true?
This is important!
You know how I feel about you.
You know how much I need you.
I would do anything for you.
She must feel something for him.
What's-his-name?
Yes that's true.
It works it works!
We've got to find him!
She did not.
She says it's not.
It's ready now I know it is.
It will be ready soon.
I'm getting used to it.
Shut up and do it!
They're here!
Look John nobody wants to find out what happens.
Well at this time I mean that is to say it is difficult to project --
That might work.
That's what we've been trying to tell you!
The only thing we can do is run!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Yeah I do!
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Make me throw it out?
You've got to learn to take responsibility!
If you got a problem you better take care of it yourself.
You're afraid of him.
What I've always done.
Well you got another problem.
That's the guy?
It was one man.
That's the funny thing about him.
He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
What did he want?
I knew him when I was still in school.
You're just in time.
Sir please try to hold still.
He's got it.
Oh God he's got it!
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Things do change.
Do you suppose that was our problem?
We met before our time?
I think that happens a lot.
We were different people then.
I remember I was trying to help...
I have to!
The same thing I suppose.
What in the...?
I know what's happening.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
What could happen?
You're here!
Did you go?
You made this out of my hair?
Getting used to it.
I could go with you.
Something else I want to try.
What did you want my hair for?
it's not here...
Do you have something to bring me down?
Just like old times.
It's got to mean something.
Oh yeah real funny.
Just look at it!
What about it!
You're the doctor.
Three days ago it was.
Why do we need it?
Oh God please!
They did it to me!
No something is really wrong...
I need help!
Something is wrong with me!
That's exactly what I am talking about.
It's this place.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!
We'll see?
Yeah we'll see.
Sometimes I can really feel it everything around us just a small part of a whole.
It's really wonderful.
Can I ask you one more thing?
It already is.
The big house.
The big house?
The big house does things to a man.
Somebody has to.
You know this and that.
Been out for six months now.
When did you...?
The question is are you?
Would you like yours first Mr.
Yeah and what might that be?
You were looking for us?
Now let's go!
Oh yes you are!
Now get your Sunday's on.
I remember you!
We lost him.
And you have him?
Do you have him?
Just one question.
Can I help you Mrs.
What in the hell?
Yes he might be.
Yes that is what I was thinking.
Well what else do you expect them to call you?
I'll go and look for her at once.
All right I'm a child.
Have it any way you want.
But no I got to listen to you and move here.
and here's some more news for you.
I should have had better sense in the beginning.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me!
- ever since I've been here.
So that's that.
and if it's all the same to you I'm moving out.
There's no reason for that.
Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink.
I'll go right down and throw them out.
Oh have we got a play!
She did most of it.
What does this mean?
That's exactly what you mean.
Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight.
Would you like that?
I'll tell you what.
Tell them I'm not home.
Stop trying to be funny and get ready will you?
We're all waiting for you.
Yes I said it.
Sure I said it.
Did you really say it?
What do you look upon her as?
You wear them of course silly.
They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Do you like them?
I've got a present.
Shut your eyes.
What do you think my friends would all say?
Oh no not me!
Plenty of room plenty of room.
Oh Mother will give us the blue room.
Oh darling of course it would.
Would that be room enough for us?
You mean you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Oh it's great.
There's only one thing wrong with it.
You know what that is?
When you move down to my place I'll show it to you.
Sure I'll be right up.
I like him.
I'm afraid she's right Mrs.
I'm really very sorry Mrs.
It's done now.
I'll explain to Mother.
Say you could do anything with me you wanted to.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Only one thing wrong with me
I wish there was something I could do for you
I know but that was news.
Give me back my letters.
For the letters of course.
Sure I'll take a chance.
Where did you get those letters?
So as long as I had your book in my hand I thought I might as well take it home and read it.
This morning I got up and put your book in my hand and here's your book in your hand.
That's a good idea - telephone the police.
You're all right.
May I use your telephone?
Oh thank you I knew you'd understand.
All right all right!
And you might show some too Mother.
What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?
The front page!
Ah-ah-ah!
I told you not to worry about him.
Good morning Mother.
What is this person doing here?
Oh hello Mother!
That's an excellent idea.
Oh shut up!
It's a great place to save a face.
I should say you had.
I found that out a long time ago.
I'll tell Mr.
Oh a party!
Pardon me Mr.
Who is it you wish to see sir?
I certainly will.
Oh that's all right with me.
But you see I'm here to find out about
I got him his job on the paper.
Well I should say!
Thanks I will.
Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
This is on the up and up.
Yeah - go on.
Not bad - not good - but not bad.
Oh boy I'd love it.
Hey make up your mind will you?
Put it on again.
Say take it easy!
Listen my boy.
That's so.
Bring me a special!
Well it's your business to get news!
What do I care about your mother- in-law!
Go back to your work.
Well where were you when that happened?
Any of them - but get it.
Right - for the first time this year.
With me you can always do business.
Get that thing out of here!
Who brought that in here?
Go on get that out of here.
Get that out of here!
I think I understand sir.
You mean you want me to go?
All right outside!
But not for me!
Though I like you well enough.
Say you are nice.
You'd make a good wife.
Oh no sir!
Thank you thank you thank you!
I'll do that for you some time.
Say listen what did you say your name was?
You're my what?
Where is Mr.
I'll get it for you
Well what would you like to have?
What other girl?
Well from now on the play will be easy.
All you have to do is bring the wife back have her say she's sorry and then your play's over.
It'll be ready in a minute.
She'll see it your way.
All right thanks.
How will I start?
You could be something.
Let's get this set.
That's a great idea for a play.
What could I be?
That's an idea there.
I wonder now...
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Yes - and I'd love it.
You know what I should do with you?
Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Must be my wife.
You certainly look good.
What did you do to that hair?
What are you doing to yourself?
There you are!
Let's get a look at you.
Oh they'll be all right.
I'll bring them around.
Not me not me.
Lucky I'll say I'm lucky!
Cut that out.
Oh I'll call you up some time.
That's the name.
I want you to meet her.
Oh sure we'll be happy.
What's the matter with your eyes?
I hope you'll be very happy.
Well well well!
What did you run away for?
There you go talking like a woman!
and those and them.
And with it came love!
She's it
Sure the story is cold but I'm not.
I thought the story was cold.
I've got to call on her this morning!
There's the third one.
Here they come!
Let me do all the thinking.
Now stand up!
We just thought that
All right you've just made it.
Surely sit down.
Surely come right in.
I suppose you know why I came?
Wait a minute - that's a great story!
I think you'd better go.
You could have bought him for six bits.
I have it here.
And find out what the boys in the back room want!
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Bring him in.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Are the cars ready?
And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Who is this woman?
Have you seen this?
See what you've done to me!?
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me?
Do what about what?
What would you say Mrs.
and there are letters...
That's all I wanted to know!
How about me?
That's all right if you like it.
Can anybody do that?
Well sir I'll show you.
How do you do it?
No that's enough.
I just wanted you to get the idea.
Now you know.
Do you hear something?
Come on what's the matter with you?
Did you call sir?
Well done sir.
Now the lady said you may go
What a small world.
Your father would never do anything like that.
You sure you want to know this?
That kind of thing?
Actually--I'm not real...
Looks just like it did.
Does it look okay?
Have you got any make up?
How can I go out there?
is something the matter?
Once you get used to it.
But I really should get home.
I've got to go...
No she's not.
I think it looks nice.
I just thought...
Okay--now you listen to me...
It goes away...
It'll go away.
You'll put on some make up and...
Look at me George.
That meeting's not for me.
Look at my face.
I told you George.
Let's just forget about it.
Let's just go to the meeting and...
You were gone all night too.
I told you where I was.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Oh darling that's wonderful!
I always knew you could do it.
I said NO!
Just let go.
It's six-thirty...
Sure is pretty.
But where would we go?
You want to get out of here?
Oh you bet.
Like that report you did on ""Our Town Hall.
Where's the cat?
What'll it be?
It's just that right now...
You want to ask her out tonight right?
But it could happen.
Kids are making out in the street.
Okay that's IT!!!
Maybe you only know it when it's gone.
You might even call it ""love.
I came home like I always do And I came in the front door.
I'm home.
One of those...
""  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that.
It's little things.
You know what I mean by ""changes""?
I'm fine--but thank you.
Oh no thanks...
Oh sure it is.
It's not in ME.
But see that's just the point.
Why am I out of order?
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
Here I'll show you.
Okay--that's enough!
They're no different than you are.
I think I've got something to say.
You're not allowed to do this!
Did you do this?
Well I never had to do it before.
What do you mean!?
And where's that?
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
How'd you know about the fire?
The one in your mind.
The other one?
The other one.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
And you're sure about this?
I'm not ready yet.
This thing works.
We could go home right now.
I'm like positive.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Gone out with you.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
So what is it?
You ever heard of him?
I had nothing to do with that fire.
You want to like take a look?
David let me tell you something.
you really like it.
They're happy like this.
You have no right to do this.
So what's the big deal.
If you need anything I'll be right over there.
I'm late for work.
I really will.
We may never get home.
I got lost.
look at this!
Can we do any better?
Those are my friends.
As a matter of fact he does.
Does he--you know--like ""me""?
Then I'll talk to him and...
Okay now you listen to me!
We're supposed to be at home David!
We're supposed to be in school.
It's not possible...
Is it possible?
Look at me?!
I'm like so...
YOU get lost!
Just give it to me!
Do you mind.
This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
David cut it out.
Can I open it?
We'll just put up the top.
There's a lot of stuff.
I picked them myself.
It's hot up here.
Well it's big.
And it's blue...
It's really really blue.
What's that like?
So what's it like?
Do they have those...
Where you come from?
And it's on all night?
You'll win this thing for sure.
When is it on?
What JOB did Mr.
For the first hundred years.
There's worse places.
Carry the three...
That comes out to...
Much less than that.
An hour and a half.
Three four weeks.
How long do you think you've been here?
The Church Social...
Okay let's cut the shit and get right to it.
I am actually...
Let me show you something!
Only if they mean it.
It was so special.
Look--it just sort of ""happened""...
What do I MEAN!
I want a word with you...
I'll talk to you then.
Look I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late.
Oh I know they're not.
Talk about it.
Right now I mean.
I got to...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
You look for someone for years...
We really do.
We just--we want to go home now.
My name's David.
Oh sure you do...
You're in...
It's free.
How much does it cost?
Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out.
Just a little--You know.
We'll get you a new one.
No that's not it.
Oh well--you're just starting out.
I'll never be able to do that.
I brought you something...
I'll try that then.
That's pretty good...
You know what I really like?
Forget about that!
That was different...
Just listen to me...
No I know...
I know I do...
But it's always the same you know?
It never changes.
It never gets any better or worse...
What are you talking about!
That is the point!
I thought we talked about this I thought we said...
Had to get home early.
You took off so quick.
I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Told you it was your lucky day.
That's not the reason.
I've got a date at six thirty.
You think you could do this like soon?
It's almost six thirty.
Saw you too.
Well it's just not true.
Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Yes I'll be there.
I'm just working....
Yeah but what are you doing?

You just said very food.
Well yeah thank you but --
I'm trying to be your friend.

Why is it always about you?
It's a free country we can look at you if we want to.
I'm not really asking you I'm telling you.
She's my friend and you should meet her.
You'd like her.
Yes indeed yes I am.
So you're coming tonight right?
I think why did you come here like this?
No I'm sorry now I have to get off the phone....
Are you telling me no?
I'll call the police.
Why did you tell me you did then?
-- you said you did.

It could be really easy.
So you think you can?
I thought you had your own business.
It's so hard these days and I really need it.
You have trouble financial trouble?
Yes no yes.
Like seven-fifty.
Seven hundred fifty?

Where do you have to go?
This is funny.
And you you.....
I'm looking at you and I just....
you're so pretty.
What is that that you're doing?
It's so nice.
You came and got me out of my room.

Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Well it's fine.
Yes I'm fine.
Everything is fine.

About six months.
How long have you known her?

They're not open yet?
I can just get you at your office.
I'm fine I have your work number.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Did you have my home phone number?
If they break or something.
I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Can I pay you here?
The police are on their way.
Well who did?
Did you do it?
Just have you for one second please.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
No I just....
No one will know your name.
And your name?
Would you like to talk to a girl?
Can I ask how much is this?
Hello how are you?

I'm a nice and reasonable man.
I'll say whatever I want --
You are bad.
You are a bad person.
I have seven.

So can you come and help me out?
I made a call.....

Why is it here?

I bought one.
You have another house somewhere or something?
Is this where you live?
I mean really...
What do you have in the house?
It's just you need to give me the money...
do you have it right now?
Wait a minute --
I'm here to get the money.
I need to talk to you for a second.
I'm sorry I know.
I know that it's....
what do you want then?
Are you serious with this?
What is this man?
Yes yes right.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Right now you're doing nothing?
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
So take a look the whole thing call me about that if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
I'm serious now.
I want you to go right away I think that's best.
As soon as you want.
When can you leave?
This is bad something might have happened we should just --
Put him through.
Hey it's me.
So they'll go.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Should I call you later?
I have no idea what he's doing then.
did my brother call you?
Just tell him to call me.
Are you coming to eat with us?
Yeah no I have to get something from my car I said.
I'll come right back I'll just go pay for my car.
I'll go pay for my car.
I'm pleased to have the new post sir.
Then what's he doing here?
Once or twice.
God's watching.
What've I done?
Go back to your room.
In ways we should not...
there are certain things...
""Turn you out?
In part yes.
I play the parts.
What I've seen in life it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Not now or we're both done for.
Then it must've been love --
Who's to say I did not?
Go to hell!
AND DID YOU?
What am I to do?
Power over another man.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
What in God's name am I to do with you?
A man after my own heart...
And to what end?
I ONLY RECORD IT!
My bed gone!
You always do.
You're better off without them.
You mean to take us all down with you?
Do I have your word?
Put yourself in my place.
Why not put that in your books as well?
The paper's cheap the type's too small --
Now you know as well as I do...
let me write it down.
I will not be the last.
And my own.
As you say Doctor.
He'll do no such thing.
I'll do everything in my power --
It most certainly was not.
You have to believe me I had no idea --
To the general public?
And his writing?
His wife's?
I've read his case history.
But I am history.
I'll pass the word on, then.
He wants to take me every way!
Get on your back!
Oh it's terrible!
It's too too terrible!
Come now darling give it a read.
""What shall I ready?
Of course you shall --
Go on child.
Yes; that's it!
In your books.
They've taken your clothes?
What have they done to you now?
What's that then?
It's a long story this one.
You talk same as you write.
I've just the story...
There's something else I want from you.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
That's a good one!
But tell him I would.
And why not?
I've nothing left to lose.
I'm a woman who knows.
And to what end I ask you?
he made me love him.
And I in yours.
Oh but I am!
What thought is that?
Oh you do do you?
YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE NO!
When I went to church...
Upon a stage?
as your wife...
How was I to tell you?
By writing a letter?
How was I to know my darling?
I'd rather read thank-you.
There we can sit...
side-by- side...
before the fire.
Do as I say.
Leave at once --
That poor woman.
I'm the Boy Wonder.
Of being found out.
I wonder sometimes.
Not you too
Last week would this be?
I did my best but well you know me
He needs me here.
Sure you can just--
Listen you come down and stay with us for a few days.
Just tell the old man that--
It's not so bad here.
Stay with us for a while.
So where does that leave us Mr.
Do you have any idea what you have done?
I'll remember that.
So I've been told.
Who are you sir?
Oh why is that?
And maybe we could get Mr.
Do you follow so far?
Not a very good picture I am told.
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great but was not.
I just want to understand--
I will not have this in my home.
You will not walk out on me
There's a different between want and
I wanted it
Did you need it?
Did you need any of it?
That -- did you need that?
How much did that cost?
That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You spent it all.
Now you better face up to it--
There's nothing to explain
Then you explain it to me?!
I am not that woman.
It's not really--
Nothing for you to worry about darling
He will have us at war by the end of the year.
There certainly is I There certainly is!
There's no call for that language-
Thank you for your time
It's all you.
Those are the only terms anybody ever knows his own.
love them so much that they ought to love you back.
Only you want love on your own terms.
This is the chance you've been waiting for boy.
Then make them up!
All right if that's the way they want it the people have made their choice.
Look into my eyes.
Good God no!
We're using-
You are talking to him.
That's right
No -- no -- I mean--
Yeah you're probably right.
The whole thing...
And in the end probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
YOU STUPID LITTLE MAN!
HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?!
So we took the chance anyway and we lost.
That's how it goes okay?
What does this have to do with--?
No but I can imagine.
What am I today?
Did I ever tell you about my father?
You wanted me out.
I want you back
We shall never change that!
And when he looks up?
But when they have the...
And what does he see?
On his conditions.
All men love.
Never said a word to her.
That's what we show.
So who is he?
We have to know him.
Then let him.
What have we got to lose you and I?
NOT UNLESS I.
TELL YOU IT IS
All that is over for me--
But all that's finished for me--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
Listen to me-
Listen to you.
This better be good
Okay boy wonder what?
What took you so long?!
Yeah it's the place God would have built if he'd had the money.
""How big is it all told?
Look at those hands.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Who the hell wants to see life?!
People are sick to death of life!
- - no one wants to see that.
I've heard it from everyone--
Of course of course.
How can we be of service?
Not one of them.
That was a fine picture!
You'll never pull it off.
You talked to Mr.
You talked to New York?
That's for me to decide.
So on to the Life Of Christ!
But ya know I'd do it again in a second.
It's my birthday this week.
I think you better sit down
I got news.
You got some death- wish fine!
I really think you're
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?!
Did you ever think about that?!
Is that what you think--?!
They bought you!
""Do what you can""?!
That's not good enough I"
Why did we have to let her come?!
There's nothing wrong with that.
Listen get off your horse with me.
What do we do about that?
I know I know!
But what more can you expect of me?!
I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
I'm Christ
He's Christ?
It's just not low enough.
We're done today
They just told me to bring you in.
I know where you're from.
We're from...
No we're all right.
You just take it easy now.
You'll do all right.
Make it on his own?
Does he know the kind of money involved?
I mean the real money.
Why's he make it so hard on himself?
He comes to me I can make it easier for him.
What is it with you?
Yeah they're good.
I think I understand what happened.
This time we forget about it but no more after this.
Believe what you want.
You know when I wait?
When it's important to wait.
It looks done.
I'll take it the way it is.
It's not done.
This looks done.
You were great.
Was my wife part of the deal?
Tell me was that it?
Nobody gives me a straight answer around here.
I mean before -- before we met.
Why'd you say them?
But you said ""you.
You or me or anybody.
What do you mean ""you""?
What do I care?
Hey I'm your brother.
Some things changed between us.
You and him been friends a long time.
Well I heard some things.
Who did it have anything to do with...
No I just told you what happened.
Well that's what I mean.
I just said hello.
So eat just a little.
We did what we had to do.
And my weight?
So you wait.
I never went down in my life.
I'll do anything.
That's all there was to it.
I got good news and I got bad news.
The bad news is...
She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Be right back.
Listen to me: I'm telling you.
Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it.
You're supposed to be a manager!
No take her home.
You want us to wait for you?
I've done a lot of bad things.
What did I do wrong?
How else could this have happened?...
What do you think they gave him the decision for that's why.
Give me a chance.
Let me look.
Do you see her yet?
How many times do I have to hit her?
I hit her enough.
She's still my wife.
Ah no no.
I know her from around here that's all.
You want to meet her or what?
Yeah she's nice.
What does that have to do with it?
That's the one...
She ever go with them?
I know her like that -- not like that.
You know her that good?
No I'm not afraid.
What's a matter?
Who's he think he is?
They just wanted to talk to you.
Answer me when I talk to you.
I can take it.
I know I can take anybody.
What was that for?
You heard me I said hit me.
You want me to do what?
Hit me in the face.
I tell you one thing.
I got a nice house three kids a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her.
Does that mean...
You hit me here.
Keep at it.
I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Three more I figure.
Why did they have to stop it?
I need to come in.
There's too many girls.
I made up my mind.
This time it's true.
Sure what else is new?
I had to work late last night.
Telephone's in the hall.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him.
Tell him you're sorry.
What do I say to him?
"" Is that what I say?
You love me?
Nothing is what I said!
I'll say anything you want me to say.
Nobody I tell you.
Come out of there!
I just had a drink that's all.
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
What was it about?
I took the kids to my sister's.
All I did...
You're the one who said he was good looking.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
That he's got a pretty face.
I love you remember?
Tell me you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
In other words you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else right?
You're not interested in him?
I'm not interested in him.
Why you like him?
What do you mean ""good looking?
Now take the rest off.
Do what I say.
You've been good for two weeks...
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Should I hit it?
Here I'll help you.
Let me watch how to do this.
I'm just in high school.
You wanted to say hello eh?
You got a baby face.
I just wanted to say hello.
You wanted to meet me?
Let's say I was a good friend of yours.
What would you tell me?
How's the weight?
Never felt better.
We're just trying to have a good time.
You're taking this the wrong way.
I said let's go.
All right I'll try.
Talk some sense into him will ya?
You're still his brother.
It's as simple as that.
Believe me my own brother.
It's very hard.
You talk to him.
The money's with your brother.
That's right take his part.
You're his brother.
Too many people are against him.
If he saw the two of us talking together right now you'd be in trouble too -- believe me.
You got everything you want.
It's a matter of time.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I'm just trying to have a good time.
No you're his wife.
What the hell am I doing wrong?
Suppose he found out.
He has it.
Does he have your number Mr.
Who am I talking with?
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
That's what they call a family problem.
Get that idea out of your mind.
I know what you told me!
She went in to get evidence and she came out with it.
I told you that --
The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
They called to report.
That depends on who ""they"" were.
Oh -- that phone call!
All the things I hate.
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it?
Did you ever own a saw?
You think he's getting out of here?
Ever get an answer?
You know every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
I can hear myself starting out.
Give him evidence.
He must ask for evidence.
If you find nothing -- he's clear.
I mean when he goes out for a paper or a drink or something.
Well then do a good job of it!
If possible -- both.
Well -- what good is his information?!!
Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Who left -- where?
Who said they left then?
-- until yesterday morning.
I think they missed their chance with her.
We know the wife is gone.
I'll see if I can find out where.
You think I made all this up?
I'll bet it's been done.
We'll pick you up.
The word is ""everything.
Next time have some good news.
Well -- you know best.
Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Read some good books.
You've got to get me out of here!
So did you.
When do I leave?
Forget I called.
This is Wednesday.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
The police have it by now.
Tell her to bring it back!
Can you get me that ring back?
That's a start.
I'll be looking for you.
I'll give you a chance to find out.
What about the rest?
Give me what you've got.
Thirty-three here.
How much do you think you'll need?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
What do you need money for?
What's she trying to do?
Now wait a minute --
What are you two talking about?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take.
Would four of them --?
You can tell that from here?
If he ever --
Well yes and no.
He's just a friend.
You called the police?
No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
I've been looked at before.
Get back there!
He'll see you!
They're up now.
What about this morning?
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
I'm certain.
House numbers that light up.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
It's hard to figure.
And some man will lose his.
Keep your mind off her.
Depends one which one.
How did you know!
She pay you much?
I'll give you two words of advice.
We still are.
Ask for trouble and you get it.
That's the hard part.
I can just hear you now.
You're too good for me!
The only honest thing to do is call it off.
Let her look for somebody else.
I need a woman who'll go anywhere do anything and love it.
She's just not the girl for me.
It's happened before you know!
She's all right.
That's normal.
It's a man.
To get over here soon as he can.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Not a word.
Now hold on.
Do you ever leave yours at home?
Something's in there.
But there's one important change.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
But you're not?
Of course they have the same chance.
You mean -- like the kitchen?
And make us some coffee?
When they're in trouble it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Say anything else and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
Well that's fine but I only have one bed and --
I have the whole weekend off.
We have all -- what?
We have all night.
I wish he'd get there though.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him.
-- That is yet.
But only her husband would know that.
He must be still on it.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Someone not his wife?
He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
To get on home.
There is -- I've seen things through that window!
Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
There's nothing to see.
He's in the room now.
Maybe she died.
A lot of things.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
What is it you're looking for?
It's more interesting.
And come back three times?
I have one now.
Your mind is.
And when I want a man I want all of him.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Without any future?
I mean what I said.
Not quite -- it seems.
Few people are.
Oh I do that all the time.
You might have to if you went with me.
Some people can.
Now if you'll let me explain --
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
How can you tell that -- from here?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
-- I could do it!
For yourself -- and me.
Make the one you want.
I wish there was one I wanted.
That's good news.
I was all morning in a sales meeting.
What a day I've had!
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
It's a big night.
And you love life?
They always live.
I heard about it.
You're lucky he lived.
We got to do something.
What are we doing this for?
I like you you know?
What you say your name was?
Where can we meet?
This is the test man.
You watch too much television.
Down in back.
How'd he get in?
He get anybody?
We got all night.
I think I should go home.
They picked him up like the rest of--
You better give me something Dad.
You'll learn as you get a little older Jim.
It's nothing!
You think you can just turn that off?
You know you did wrong.
Will you wait a minute?
Are you listening to me?
You're involved in this!
You're absolutely right!
I've never done anything right.
She never wants to hear.
Will you let him tell it!
I was in it.
I'm in terrible trouble.
Now Dad--I need an answer now!
You know I never stop you from anything.
Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.
What can you do when you have to be a man?
We'll make time.
Where's some paper.
The kind we've been talking about.
Can you answer me now?
How'd that happen!
What kind of trouble you in?
Let's get a little light on the subject.
What would you do Dad?
Would you do it?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
That's funny!
It's just this get-up.
Sure--  You know something?
Not just buy!
You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.
You buy me many things.
You mind if I try?
I try to get to him--what happens?
Hold it Jim.
Tell him why we moved here.
I think I know my son.
No--thanks very much Mr.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
What about you Jim?
Got anything to say for yourself?
That was my son!
No he's not here.
Is he there?
I still think you should go down.
He's home.
I heard the car.
First I thought it was Jim but--
Far be it from me to tell you what to do but there's--
Did anyone see you there?
I was talking to Jim.
Well maybe she better start.
Do you hear from him son?
They not together sir.
Come with me John.
I just went next door to look at them like I always do.
I'll wait for him.
Come back tomorrow.
My parents know I'm out.
They know I'm here.
He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.
Keep away from me!
Make them go away.
They like you.
They said I could come in and bring you out.
Just give it to me for a second.
I need it.
Can I keep it?
Sure I'm sure.
You ready to come out now?
We were coming right back.
What you run out on me for!
You remember that far back?
When I was here?
I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
I came here before.
I only went twice though.
I'm what?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
We'll take it!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!
They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Let's take it for the summer.
Well now-there-then!
Hey where'd you go?
Help me in!
They think you told the police on them.
They--who's in there?
They're looking for you!
It's me!
Who's that!
You better take off...
if you could only have been my father...
I got to go in.
You better get home too.
Should I leave?
How'd you get here?
In the morning.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
They're still there!
Go- go-go!
That's why I came back.
Now they're waiting for you.
What's yours?
What's your name!
So's she.
It's hard to make friends with them.
Once you been up there you know you been some place!
He's not saying that!
But I am involved!
There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Why should you be the only one.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.
And you wanted him to make a list!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
I have to talk to you both.
And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
What happened darling.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
All right darling.
You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Any time--day or night.
Look will you do something for me?
You got me Jim--but they do.
Want some water?
One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
""If he could"" what?
You mean your father?
If he could--
They think I'll make friends if we move.
So then you moved?
They never do.
That why you moved from the last town?
You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway.
All the time!
Let it out.
Someone giving you hard looks?
Cut it out now.
He was trying to make us his family.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.
He needed you maybe.
He needed us.
I got to find him.
I love you Jim.
I really mean it.
It is for me too.
I love somebody.
All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.
And it's so easy.
Why is it easy now?
Not for you and not for me.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I know already.
That was nice.
You're so funny.
Want to read any books?
Take your pick!
Ever been in a place like this before?
I bet you hear everything I say!
There's just one thing.
You see we've just--oh you tell him darling.
You decide darling.
Remember our budget.
No--come on.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
I know a place!
Where can we go?
But I've never been in love.
Lots of times.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I'm getting that way too.
Like even today.
You still here?
Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.
Even if I'm near a fire I'm cold.
I tried to call you before.
No--I was just--maybe--
They'll be looking for you.
I'm not so bad.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
The kids take me.
So where's the high school?
See I'm new.
Where I saw you.
You live around here?
Where what was.
""Life can be beautiful.
"" Hey I know where it was.
Now that's true!
I saw you before.
Well he might as well be dead.
Talk to them!
It's far away from the rest of the house.
If you have children--Oh I hate the word!
His name's Jim.
You have to get to know him.
What's he like?
Is he your friend?
You said you'd call my father.
She's being called for.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
You know where they picked me up!
I'll never get close to anybody.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?
Do you enjoy that?
I was just talking a walk.
I hate my life.
I just hate it.
Do you think your father means that?
Since I got to be sixteen?
I'd like to that's all.
I'd like to change the subject.
I was talking to Dad.
I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Come on we have to eat.
Nothing only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
They had schools in those days.
If you were my sister?
He'll be dead when he does.
I've been doing good though.
One more day baby.
One more day to Christmas.
That's a book baby.
That's a book of love.
how many letters is that?
And they were before this guy.
All those letters are about to pay off baby...
all those letters...
He wants me.
He wants the money.
You said talk to him.
That's all you ever said...
Is this him!?
This is the guy you been waiting for.
Can you help me or not?
How old are you sixteen?
I never told you my name.
You said it a million times!
How'd you know my name?
He did love you you know.
He did love you.
That's love.
we go together.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
They all are.
Football's on.
Is he in his room?
I'm working on it here.
He says he wants it now.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
When it happens.
I'll need to be part of it.
We'll need one.
Why'd you save me?
in five whole years...
We'll get there baby...
we'll get there...
All I wanted...
was to make it home...
There went my...
That guy knows you?
So does it look a lot different?
Get your own room.
They really need me...
What's the last place they took down?
He working for them on this one?
Not without you.
That's all he wants!
you know how...
I thought we'd have a few more days.
But you knew why.
He said he wanted to talk to you.
When he found the letters...
I thought he meant --"
How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
That's all they want!
And we'll get out of this!
He just wants what you know!
You're in on this.
If you talk him into thinking you're not you you'll only get yourself dead.
Get the hell off of me!
You sold him out.
He went through my room.
He found your letters.
he's come over more and more.
I'm not him.
I'll see what you can do.
We could live it up and --
Since you worked there?
You forget where I work?
You're my Christmas.
Yeah well you wrote me you were six- foot-four baby.
What's good?!
I'm not talking about the words.
Guy I was in with...
you'd like him --
Yes it was all you --
they never want to know me.
When they do they think that means they know who I am.
That they know me.
That there's nothing left to learn.
Tell me again.
You're not the first guy I wrote to.
But you're the only one I kept writing to.
No not that no...
I mean this the whole thing.
This the first time you've ever done this?
For a long time.
Do that again.
Be like you want to be.
You are to me.
I mean be serious...
How'd you know my name.
How'd you know my name...
Get in the CAR!
if it was three or four...
You need six.
Six is me.
We got five.
they change it every month.
I been trying to hit you.
It's time for me...
to be working for me.
And I need you.
Four five million miles of road.
You were talking to him!
What'd you tell him!?
two out of three?
You got one hour.
You walk the room as many times as you want but the second you come out I want to know the run of the place.
Might as well be.
So what the hell good are you...
Called it the...
And I worked there.
For a year.
We walked the place for a week.
Hey it's...
been two years --
You know how to get in and out.
You know where the money is.
That a true story now?
Day-to-day.
You knew the place --
It's her brother.
Be more specific.
What'd they call her in college?
What'd they call her in high school?
What's her middle name?
Where's she work?
Wish I had a brother like you.
She's getting you to help us...
She says a lot of things.
I give this writing an A-plus.
So you could get with my sister.
But you were saying you were...
I knew about her letters!
I -- I just wanted to be --
I knew about him and her okay!?
I took his place!
You got the wrong guy!
Who are you now.
I know you real well.
There never was a structure change.
This place was built the same from day one.
Where the HELL did he go?
Get in there and watch 'em.
so where is he?
what you're...
Show's over.
Making money for our community.
We're doing it right here.
We're aware of your position.
We understand you Mr.
Then who knows what else they changed.
No the place.
moving everything around.
You work here long?
How are ya.
How do we do that?
How do we take them out?
What the hell was that about --
You want that for here or to go?
I gave them me.
I do love her.
You had that right all along.
You gave them me.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Way back when I worked there.
And you set me up.
She set them up.
Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
be with her...
YOU TELL HER!
I'll be there...
Take it man!
You're all right!
Hold it in!
Standing right here man!
Two days we got two days!
No I'm through with that shit.
I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Thought you hate your old man.
All I want...
Read this part.
and it's not there.
I'm just talking.
anything I want to do.
Remember when she wrote that?
Anything I want...
Right there waiting.
Three days man.
What's the first thing man?
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
There is no other table --
Then get yourself another table!
I'm ninety-two years old --
You're taking my money.
I had a five...
That was My card!
You hit for my card!
I got an idea on that one.
What the hell is this room?
That's what it looks like!
There's nothing you can say I've heard it all before.
Are you clear about that?
You're coming back to work for us right?
No you'd keep me for yourself.
I mean I like you a lot -
That I should've picked you up?
No where's Mr.
I'll call somebody.
I got a few questions of my own ya know.
Daddy I got an idea.
Now just hear it out.
He's been gone for four years.
Daddy did ya see that?
That's your story?
I'm correct about that right?
And apparently he would so things to her.
You know who she looked like?
I've seen it happen.
Look this is the news.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Not after he's seen everybody.
Well let's go get it.
You two take a car each I'll follow ya.
I got a bag.
Would you stop it with that shit!
Okay first things fucking last where's the shit?
Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Was it me?
You think I set you up?
Nobody set anybody up.
Now this story takes place in this men's room.
You remember what's important and the rest you make your own.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
But what is this?
I tell it real good too.
Where I was from who I knew how I knew Nice Guy had I done time shit like that.
Did the two of you talk?
The way they talk to each other.
My name's Mr.
When we got to the bar...
Now if it's a manager that's a different story.
Myself and Mr.
Let's go over it.
When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Tell me a story?
I just wanted you to know they meant a lot.
What the hell did you expect me to do?
Just forget about you?
It's a change.
I'm right!
Blue's dead?
I'm Mr.
Listen up Mr.
And you can go down either of 'em.
You're not Mr.
Tell you what let me be Mr.
That sounds good to me I'm Mr.
Since nobody knows anybody else nobody wants to back down.
So forget it I pick.
Why am I Mr.
We like each other too much.
Like hell I am.
That piece of shit.
No they're not.
They're like a way station.
Five-man job.
Sorry it's my book now.
And when I come back I want my book back.
No she did it.
Give me my book.
Give me my book back!
Give me this fucking thing.
You heard 'em they said he's on his way.
As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit.
Down to my car.
Follow you where?
If I had any idea what type of guy you were I never would've agreed to work with you.
What's my problem?
I need a doctor!
I'll take care of myself.
Look in my eyes look right in my eyes.
I can' take you to a hospital.
It's not good...
Who are we waiting for?
Answer me please are you a doctor?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
So let's get this straight.
You know what I heard the other day?
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr.
So tell me, Mr.
White, if you think Mr.
Now I know I'm no piece of shit...
And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...
So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
Right now Mr.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Well that's that then.
And he asked me what my name was.
I told him where I was from a few days ago.
I told him my first name and where I'm from.
Well he knows a little about me.
We're on our own.
Before you got here Mr.
So is he dead or what?
Now you're using your head.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Just walked away from it.
Then where is everybody?
I mean that could be happening right now.
That was the plan we meet here.
No they're not in the car.
Yes we can go right now.
But first listen to what I'm telling you.
Are they out in the car?
I got 'em all right?
Once I got out I never looked back.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
I mean Jesus Christ how old do you think that black girl was?
Twenty maybe twenty-one?
That's the way I look at it.
Could you believe Mr.
No real people?
You're right this is bad.
How did you get out?
Look enough of this ""Mr White"" shit -"
That's how I know we were set up.
What's wrong with it?
Okay let's go through what happened.
I felt funny about this job right off.
As soon as I felt it I should said ""No thank you"" and walked.
But I never fucking listen.
I just felt it.
But I wanted to believe him.
And I always said if I felt that way about a job I'd walk.
Let's go in the other room...
Well you better start thinking about it.
In fact that's all I'm thinking about.
One minute they're not there the next minute they're there.
In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there.
You really think we were set up?
Oh this is bad this is so bad.
Oh that's just fucking great!
It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on.
This is a hard job.
Did you ask her?
The light was bad.
Want to come along?
Maybe he did.
Go right out and get her.
build the fire up.
And one of 'em is sick.
They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Tell them to come on in.
well you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there...
To the other side of the street.
Like I said women get in the way sometimes.
I know now why you did it.
Thanks for taking over.
Maybe they will.
Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
If you want to go on I can make it all right.
So keep your money.
Go on take it.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
All my clothes --
No I'm not all right.
Then let's get started.
All right -- it's said!
Just tell me I'm not good enough for you.
Say what you want to say.
I'll listen.
What did you expect?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Tell me darling.
Maybe it's better that way.
But -- that was the other night.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Oh it did.
It had a great deal to do with you.
Now I'm not sure.
I thought it had something to do with me.
Why do you think?
I've been over it before.
You'll need it later on.
It's too light yet.
But the rest is right.
Tell me more about her.
You should know.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
I suppose it is.
I'm sorry but that's how it's got to be.
I hope so too.
So that was why she tried to run away.
His letters will keep.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
There's a nice boy.
Go on there's a good boy.
Would you Mr.
And look at it this way.
Of course it'll work.
You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Our kind of women?
There are jobs waiting for us there.
We'll pay you for your trouble.
You can stay here if you like.
It's quite a job.
This must have been in the family a long time.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
They were in it.
I -- lost something.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
You'll live.
What other reason would there be?
Is that the only reason you came back?
What did you come back for?
Half of them are mine.
You know what she asked me?
I'd be man enough to do that.
Sit down and eat.
Till I say the word you're doing what you're told.
Go on hit me.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
You better start.
But make up your mind.
There's only two of them now.
But you never can tell.
Yeah it does.
Maybe I should.
that's the time you went away.
That's what I told you then.
Sure I remember.
Like I said before a twenty- two's more your size.
How'd you happen to miss?
There was only three of them at first.
And meet him there.
We come along here.
I'm your brother.
Think he will?
No call to.
How's she feel?
A man I used to know.
A little hot.
How does she draw?
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
I'm sorry about this Mr.
That's a good girl.
Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different.
Go away -- please.
Stop it -- stop it.
Drink this and stop being silly.
Why would anyone want to live in this place.
In a week you'd be talking to yourself.
Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
But I want to stay.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
I figure we'll get along just fine.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
They went on like I told you.
Suppose I take a look.
Some people who went by this way lost it.
Two men and some women.
Well say it.
We tried to point that out.
Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Depends on how good you drive.
Can I make it?
What do you know about that.
Did you sell your place?
That's it then.
I'm sure of this.
But not of you.
I've been watching you change.
Maybe you are.
We might as well start a fire.
What's the use.
Have another try at him.
Maybe I better start working on him.
How many ways can a man say no.
You're not giving up?
He certainly could.
About a month.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
There's still tomorrow morning.
And we're running out of that.
I tried my best but these things take time.
If only three show up he might call the whole deal off.
We've got to stick together.
Like we've always done.
That usually works.
Yeah but suppose he took us up on it.
Where would we be?
Who brought you here?
How do you know who we are?
Yeah we sure have.
We got company.
Your friend'll be there.
Let's stay here until morning.
Put on another one.
Take a look at him.
They're all I need...
If you need me I'll be --
It's a long ways yet.
Let me do that.
But you're his brother.
That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with.
I knew right off what you were thinking.
Would they be good to eat?
What do they look like?
-- and even if I do learn to read what use'll it be?
All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
That's the end of the line.
Nobody's too old to learn.
That's for little kids.
Nobody said nothing to me.
You're so nice.
You know you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Maybe I could start you out.
I sure would.
Would you like to learn them?
I was at first.
You think you can take him from me?
Well over my dead body.
I think he wants me.
I found a picture of his wife.
She was so nice.
I was and how I wanted to have his children.
How long were you together?
Oh this is too much.
I wear a size eight too.
maybe that would be best.
best of friends...
Let's get him!
Hey I have an idea...
It's coming!
Hey what class do we have next?
Actually I just met her.
Your friend needs help.
We already know each other.
Now shut up and let me finish.
He was right behind us.
I should go first.
Oh I'm fine...
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
What should we get?
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Let's get a hot dog.
Look what I'm trying to say --
Listen to me I --
I know but I've been thinking --
Yeah I know I just love having a guy for a friend.
but only as a friend.
It's a matter of life and death.
I'm asking you a friend.
Now come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Better try a little higher.
Try a little higher.
Can you feel that?
It might be our last night in this house.
And seeing that tonight might be our last night together I was thinking...
Wait I want to check something.
Give me a hand.
You really think she looks like me?
She looks like you.
Wait I'm just about to tell you the best part.
We can practice talking.
Yeah it will be fine.
Stuff like that you know.
I'm a girl.
have a girl as a friend.
See you later friend.
But hey maybe we can be friends.
Hey you left your book back there.
So whatever happened to her?
Okay I get the point.
Thanks I'll be fine.
I'll be next door if you need me.
What you think I did this to myself?
He was right behind me a minute ago.
Right behind you.
He almost got us.
Come in somebody.
Listen no need for you to worry.
All that stuff that happened before is behind us.
Let's just try to move on.
I'm sorry I should have been watching where I...
So I came back for you.
Both of them?
Yes it was me all along.
It was you...
Made you say it!
Not in a thousand years.
Would you ever tell me ""Stop.
No actually I found him like this.
That's his stuff.
I made them by hand.
I'm here with the...
Nobody wants to go.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Tell me what happened?
No my friends are right here!
Me and my friends...
Yes we made it!
That turned out to be a good thing!
I'm about to get paid.
what about your head?
Can you type?
Did you do that?
Hey I got an idea.
Yeah you feel that?
Now put it all together.
So how do you like being in college?
So do you think you made it into the class?
It happened right here.
She came home.
She saw them.
Got a problem with that?
Come on it's college.
We better record this.
Yeah I can see that.
I can do it myself.
Now the bus will be here on Monday.
That's why we came here remember?
It's not what is looks like.
Help me get her to her room.
What the hell?!
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Get her upstairs.
Is she dead?
Yes I thought that it would be best.
What's all this stuff?
Hey you're the one who brought up safety.
I'll make it part of the class.
Where did you find these kids?
And this one?
Ooh I like her.
Any of them hot?
Let me help you.
I'll get them.
We should stick together.
What do you use on it?
Work work work.
Is that all that you do?
What are you working on?
How about two?
Who's first?
You mean to tell me we're dead!
I might need your help.
What do you know about it?!...
The only chance we have is to use this machine.
I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Father come in please.
Father I think you should rest.
What she said about your mother?
Did you bring my bag?
Father are you okay?
Would you like to see the girl?
Okay -- Dear God --
Dog you look hot.
Yo son check this out.
Yeah I always wanted to watch you eat.
Bring her home...
IT WAS REAL!
That's right up the street!
Just in case!
How about Mrs.
We both hate her!
What's the trouble officer?
I hate Mr.
We'll see what your teacher has to say.
I certainly did not.
You'd probably date him!
Just a little please.
This is so silly.
I have to open.
Time to get up that's all.
You'll be late for work.
I'm so happy I could shit.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm your mother and I love you.
Let me see!
Oh God really!
She sure can pick 'em!
I'm sorry he's dead but...
We hope so son.
And no matter what your mother is we'll love her anyway.
What is it officers?
Everything's fine kids!
BOTH OF YOU!
GET IN THE CAR!
My wife knows nothing about this terrible...
I got somebody you could run over Mother!
I'm happy.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
He goes to college with me!
I love that you're my wife.
Hey I'm late for work.
Listen to his call.
No woman would!
It was her!
I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
I certainly did.
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Did you see her?!
So you do drink?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs.
I certainly was not!
do you drink?
It's her I tell you IT'S HER!
Watch what you're doing!
What did you just say?
It's not fair!!
Just a half-a-cup.
Alright I'll try...
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Yes I am...
I'm sorry Mrs.
I've changed my number twice already...
Please help me!
I made it all up!
What do you mean you're not sure?!
Yes I was.
State your name please.
You got your wish.
I saw his dead body!
I'll be back!
I hate 'em!
Just a boy.
I do please.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Look at her hair!
The police were at my house this morning.
You know how they are.
Well you're doing something wrong Mrs.
No he did not!
Is there a problem at home?
What is it Mr.
There is one big problem though.
Nice to meet you Mr.
SHE DID IT!
I saw one!
How to send a bill!!
What's he know?
I'd forget it if I were you.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice it'll be good advice.
You could go and open the door.
I'd like to get out of here.
It's only a little way Mr.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Which room is it?
Can we go there now?
You think my sister is there?
Why would Mrs.
That's what she told you.
She bought my sister's business.
You've got to take it easy.
Do you know a Mrs.
I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
The name may not mean anything to you young lady but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You may as well drink.
May I have some water?
You want to now.
You should want to.
When I wanted to.
I read your book.
But tell me --
Oh as beautiful as ever.
For the time being I imagine that must do.
How much have you got?
I'll give you a check.
How much does she want?
It's not just for myself I'm asking.
Her sister is here.
I want to know where she is.
She came to me a few days ago.
She needs money.
I ought to know.
I like to work on your hair.
She's a pretty good sort.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
I'll try there.
Just ask the people who run it.
They'll remember her.
Nothing's happened to her.
I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
That's why I came to see Mrs.
She was asking about us.
What did she want to know?
And that was all?
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
What were you talking about?
I did her hair.
Stay that way.
I love you - you know that?
It's what I should have done yesterday.
I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
Drink your coffee.
Any court in the land would understand.
We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
We know what happened.
We've tried so long to find her.
She's got to be found.
He's sitting right over there.
There is a very simple way.
Got a telephone book?
If there were only some way --
Oh I had business with a man...
but I missed him -
They seem nice.
It's not much money but it's enough to live on.
I've a job for you.
I'll never order you about again.
Drink your milk.
I made him do it.
I saw him on the floor.
He was cut -  --here.
He was dead.
But you do believe me?
) You'll have to do other things...
I hope you'll let me help you.
It was a lovely dinner.
I can understand.
I love her very much.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
I wish you had come to me first.
I suppose she told you about me
Not from me.
She'll have to know some time.
Let her know what?
I can pick him up somewhere.
Could you find him?
We could tell him.
Do you think he knows about this?
This is the part of New York I love.
It is old.
If you listen the houses will speak to you.
in their time they've all lived here.
But I understand her.
That may be more important.
You'll be all right?
I'll only be gone until three.
I was one of them.
We all understand each other.
We all know.
Both of you - you're off to work.
Death can be happy..
Then perhaps you might understand"
I keep telling myself that.
She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I've been trying to find him.
And you believe that?
You went to see Mrs.
She told you something -- what was it?
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
I have to go -
I came to say good-by.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I want you to see it  to know me better.
I want you to see my room.
I want you to see all of it.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Such a simple matter.
No one else had read it since.
But why should Mrs.
I found out that Mrs.
I have something even better.
And you knew he'd be here.
I'll bring your food to their table.
We are happy Mrs.
Ah my wonderful one.
Well since you're over twenty one
I just want to look at them.
No not at all Mr.
It's here too.
Who was the first one -- Mrs.
When did you say you wanted them?
They may have found her.
If you like I'll go with you to dinner.
Let her know --
What was in your mind?
I'll do all I can to help.
I think it's time.
When I tell you.
I should like people to read what I've written.
I think I understand without your telling me.
What was she to you?
I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again.
But why come to me?
See that girl?
I saw you with her last week.
I knew you'd be here tonight.
You know where she is?
I've come to take you to your sister.
No she's with her sister
I'm very very serious.
What made you change your mind?
I never thought you did.
I want to join you.
You are not one of us yet.
But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
But you would like to know where she is?
I know too much.
It seems right to us.
I had to help get rid of the body.
This is Mrs.
Thank you my dear.
It's my business now.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Could you let me see that room?
One day a beautiful car comes here.
But she was here?
She's not been here for a long time.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs.
That makes it all the more difficult 
She's very beautiful.
Many people come here.
I thought you might know her.
She was seen here about a week ago.
I'm worry to bother you.
I want to ask you about my sister.
I'll be right back with Mrs.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
The other children.
Then it is decided.
I know this is difficult for you.
I know that you love her.
She told him about us.
But he also wrote --
I went back through the history last night.
You have only to drink a little.
This is very trying for me.
somebody could say or do something to you while you're in this...
All that stuff you did?
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say ""That's why!
I want to know why you are the way you are!
What is it exactly that you want to know?
Why is anybody anything?
You want to know?
You want to know how I feel?
Is that what you wanted to hear?
I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I asked you ""how does it feel""?
How does it feel Mr.
Come on how does it feel?
Yeah you're right.
Oh you just moved here to think about it right?
I really would rather not talk about it.
Look at you look at what's happened to you look how you've changed!
Like maybe a big part?
But that was part of it?
Did you come back here just to see her again?
But you're planning to be?
I could start to --
I've told you.
I'm asking for real.
But if you were?
I'm not in love with you.
If you were in love with me would you?
I'm not planning on it.
I mean John's like this kind of...
And you feel the same way with John?
Plus I've never really felt able to open up with anyone.
There's nothing left to imagine there's no...
I'm not sure I will.
I just want out.
I thought I was but obviously I was wrong.
And anyway I'm asking the questions.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
And now you can?
The problem was me.
Or am I should say.
What was the problem?
No it was wonderful.
Was it so bad that it turned you off?
If I asked you to would you?
Not on tape I mean?
Go down on me?
I thought I made that clear before when I said I would go down on you.
You're not like your sister.
all right look.
I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Do you want me to stop?
Have you decided to leave John?
It's a simple question.
Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Does he go down on you?
When we're making love?
Do you talk to him?
Tell me your name.
I have money.
How do you pay for all this?
What do you have to do to get ready?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
She said it on her tape.
I'm not sure why I came here.
I had kind of decided not to talk to you after...
Maybe you want to go.
This is just...
I'm sorry this came up.
why do you do this?
Sometimes they do things.
And they just answer them?
You just ask them questions?
Anything I can think of.
Can we look at one?
You went out with her?
Oh just a personal project like anyone else's personal project.
Mine's just a little more personal.
What kind of personal project?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Not much to see I'm afraid.
Are you in the middle of something?
I believe in it for some people.
They are looking at you.
And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Well I've been watching you.
I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time.
As long as it's not...
It has to be like mine like something about you.
Do you want me to?
So what's your personal thing?
Yeah actually I do.
Do you want them?
So what about kids?
I think that's very true.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Can I tell you something personal?
I feel like I can.
Other than John.
Well maybe you are.
I feel like they do.
Okay I will!!
Would you mind?
What's the first?
Mother father sister.
This food is excellent.
I would imagine that we are now.
That's hard to believe.
The two of you seem so different.
I knew him very well.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Or could mean lots of things.
We own a house and I really like that you know?
What about it do you like?
Oh I like it.
I like it very much.
The whole thing was really...
Well I did.
No I think you look...
Have you ever been on television?
Oh you mean to bring in!
This is all I need to stay here.
Do you have other things?
Oh no problem.
It can wait.
Well please sit down.
I have thought about it yes.
Not very often.
You're making no sense.
No but I wanted to.
Where did you go when you left here?
She's so...
You've made your point.
I'm not either!!
I was just saying you know?
My sister for one.
Is that who it is?
If I'm right I want to know.
Well are you?
Jesus Christ where'd that come from?
I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Who'd you have lunch with?
I just got busy.
I had a late lunch.
Do you remember where you were?
Stay away from the Garden District.
Oh we get along okay.
She's just very...
You did that?
I know but this...
I hate my sister.
Do you think that's possible?
well he said a lot of stuff.
I thought that's what I did.
Who was it that you talked to?
He's just so different somebody new to have a conversation with.
No he left last week.
Is he still at your house?
Actually that turned out to be pretty interesting.
well like John you know?
But he turned out to be this...
But not too recently.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Well I kind of tried once.
Did you do anything?
About a week ago.
I mean I would've said yes I just wish he would've asked.
Well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are?
The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds.
Yes I remember.
I get real busy between two and four.
Do you have my work number?
I was just trying to --
It does not.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
You are in serious trouble.
I feel like I do.
Listen to you!!
No but I did.
He could be...
I wanted him to see me.
But why did you want to?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Well like what did he ask exactly?
He just asked me questions.
Then why'd you call me?
Well what then?
No it's nothing like that.
What the hell happened over there?
Did he make a pass at you?
Did you tell him about me?
Now if you'll pardon me I have to go to work.
How about this: you buy her something nice and I'll pay for half.
I just thought it might --
Will you stop?
do whatever it is you do.
Let me talk to him first.
Well I'll call him when he does.
How would you know what ""my type"" is?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together.
Well I wonder why.
Do you have to say that?
I just asked what he looked like.
Why so you can go after him?
I just want to know what he looks like is all.
So what's he look like?
Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that but after talking to him...
he's just kind of...
So what's he like is he like John?
It was busy.
There's a phone here.
Do you mean...
in front of him.
Did you take your clothes off?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
Well what the hell am I supposed to do?
How about if you record over the one we already made?
You could have the same date and not use another tape.
Who would know?
You'll have to get somebody else.
I never do more than one.
Not even one more?
I'd like to make another tape.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like the way I look?
If you wish.
Then I started moving my hand and then he stopped talking.
He said that my hand felt good.
What did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like?
Very much live.
When I was fourteen.
eight years old.
I said he could if I could watch him take one too.
I'd rather sit.
Do I sit or stand?
That depends on you.
One woman only used three minutes.
How long will it take?
And you ask questions right?
You start talking.
How do we start?
They are for my private use only.
Would anybody else see the tape?
Is this how you get off or something?
I just want to ask you questions.
You just want to ask me questions?
Which is it?
What do you get?
I think I get it.
You're probably friends or something.
Why did you want to come here?
You can imagine the rest.
I just want to know why you're here.
You want me to leave?
She called you that too.
May I ask why you're here?
No John things are getting real simple.
I knew it I knew it.
John we have nothing to talk about.
Maybe I want to talk.
Will you please leave now?
you're mean.
I've just been thinking about things that's all.
Did he put you up to this?
Well I'm here now.
I'd like to do something...
Actually no I've changed my mind.
Exactly what I said.
This stuff could show up anywhere.
She is my sister.
I tell her almost everything.
I felt like it so what?
They just talk?
""The wrong hands""?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
What's so stupid about it?
Look I'll call you okay?
Nothing wrong with trying.
She's there?
What's she doing there?
Your wife is here would you like to speak to her?
I've got a client waiting.
Yeah I know what you mean.
Well when then?
Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Maybe he's the man I'm looking for.
I really think he's in a bad way.
Can I meet this friend of yours?
No I mean doing it at my house.
If you want to leave leave.
I only get one today?
I've got to get back to the office.
How about for five hundred?
Not for three-fifty.
You said three-fifty?
It'll just be me.
Plenty of room for two people.
I think that means you have.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Give them to me!!
I need help?
God you need help.
What the hell do you think?
I like having the car the car is important.
She held up very well.
Yes this afternoon.
You have family here also?
Yeah it's not bad.
Everybody has a past.
Anyway I've always said the work is the thing.
All right jesus.
Okay in a minute I'm on with a client.
I want you to make love to me.
Please please make love to me.
Was he nice to you?
probably nothing at all.
Your father'll never miss it.
He called me at six this morning.
I want you to go out for lunch with me.
Then what brought you up here?
You knew these people?
Move anything before we got here?
Well let's go talk to your doctor.
Takes too long to get into the city.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Far as I know yeah that was her.
And that was her.
I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there.
I've got to see if it's...
if it's what we both think it is.
Might take a while.
Are there any more on the list?
Here's the stuff you wanted.
I thought they might interest you.
Make love to me make love to me love love to me...
You start it.
Do you want to make love?
All over the place.
I'll come home right after work.
I just thought I might want to call you.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Can I call you at the office?
I think she must go to look for you.
I'll meet you back there.
It'll have to do for now.
What's your number?
I hit it.
Please pardon me.
Give them this.
But we usually went to my place.
Must have gone home to mother.
She had a couple just like them.
See you at ten.
What do I do then?
I've got a date with one of them at ten.
Can you make it?
You were next on my list.
I told you that.
We never really knew what it was we were working on.
I was just thinking about you.
She was twelve.
They used to come here sometimes.
Who was she?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life?
I want you to come into this with me.
He wanted you in anyway.
You can afford it.
That was my father's idea...
But he's dead now.
Look at that beautiful stuff...
But you gave up your private practice.
So who changes?
Take all you want.
Who was it from?
I got it!!!
I know I know it's just...
He needs help.
The real you.
Of course Mrs.
But make sure it's your own.
He was a President.
You know I find it...
Sounds like my husband.
He never came back either.
Everything's free there.
First name terms surely!
In a way...
but you can be sure of one thing...
it all starts here!
I'll leave you young things to it.
I just came to give you this.
You have your life.
And I have mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
What are you trying to do?
That's us.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
He moved all right!
To better himself.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
But they only think they're happy.
Could I do that later?
Oh my poor baby.
Thanks Officer Park...
say that's for...
very well and...
I'm sorry Officer.
I NEED SOME
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I should be with my people...
For his own good.
But what'll I do?
What'll I say?
What'll I wear?
And everybody needs you!
Well there's still hope.
Lots of hope.
He's never done that before.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
You must stay here tonight.
That way we can all be here when Mr.
What does he know about it?
How wonderful to see you.
Who do we love?
We love you Baby.
And none of them worked?
You mean from ""One Life to Live""?
Where'd you go to high school?
I'm a bad girl.
I'll call you when we get there and we can talk about it then okay?
He's your friend.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Just seeing how you're doing.
It'll just take a second.
We did all we could.
Tell him I'll call back.
It's not about the quality of the books.
Actually there is word.
So what's happening?
Still no word?
You okay Miles?
I think she's off tonight.
Busy night for a Tuesday.
I love it up here.
Lot of good stuff.
We  all want to read it.
Do you need some money?
She was good for you.
You knew her right?
Yeah I remember the girl who was in it with me.
She was something.
Oh stop it.
I've got to run and put my face on.
Well you were wonderful on that show.
They're from both of us.
Not so bad yourself.
You both do.
How're you?
We just had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.
That's what people say.
Whatever you girls want.
It's on us tonight.
You are not.
Anything I'd know?
That's on us.
Back at you.
Love you man.
That about does it.
No not whatever.
You need a new car anyway.
I'll pay for it.
Come on let me drive.
Want me to drive?
Quite a week.
Quite a day.
That was quite a day yesterday.
I'll get it myself.
Just go explain the situation.
The plan is...
So what's the plan?
So how was she?
Please Miles please.
We've got to go back.
You know what I'm thinking?
What's it look like to you?
Maybe a couple of them.
Then they break it again.
You told him.
I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Just what you just said.
That's beautiful.
Half my life is over and I have nothing to show for it.
No I'm finished.
I like books.
Just write another one.
You have lots of ideas right?
Let me use your phone.
I say we check it out.
You ever actually been in there Miles?
Yeah they're great.
I know what you need.
I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Yeah that's...
Just stop okay?
Make something up and that's what happened.
This is all a big party for you but not for me!
And you -- Just...
You're fucking me up.
So tell me everything.
Here's my boy!
Who's your daddy boy?
Who is yo' daddy?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
I SAID OKAY?
You have to tell me --
I said okay?
I know you are.
what is that?
Well yeah that's part of it.
Is what the money thing?
Is it the money thing?
All I know is she's beautiful.
Throw me his ball.
What's the matter with you man?
Could be anything.
Hear anything yet?
Can you give me some room here?
She's working.
I need a break anyway.
This is our day!
That's a public course.
And you're asking me to go against it.
And that's just wrong.
That was three years ago after that first party!
What do you care anyway?
Here's what I'm thinking.
What do you think she's looking for?
This is totally different.
I have not said the words.
Yes I have and do I look like a happy man?
Is she a part of my life now?
Look who's talking.
You've been there.
And give up everything?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
And I'm not getting it.
Things are so easy with her.
Oh you've been thinking.
Well I've been doing some thinking.
But I've been honest.
Does she know about Saturday?
Hey there you are.
You should call her.
You know how to to do it.
Shut your face.
How small she make you feel.
Oh Jesus Miles.
She's funny.
These girls want to party.
I mean come on!
Pull yourself together man.
Do you remember that guy?
People love that guy.
So what should I wear?
I want to watch this.
Want to come?
A bad girl Miles.
You've all been talking about it?
Behind my back?
Talking about it?
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party!
People move on.
Makes you feel special or something.
I want to go home now.
Jesus Christ Miles.
To that guy?
About a month ago.
Yeah but that's not the whole story.
I'm okay with it.
I mean this is our last chance.
This is our week!
Sure big guy.
It's your party.
Maybe you'd have a better time on your own.
You take the car.
And I'm serious.
Do you read me?
So what's the plan today?
Getting off work.
Looking for love.
Somebody had to do the talking.
And by the way I was right.
You were all over her.
How would that ever work?
Now we're getting somewhere.
What else do you know about her?
Let's just eat okay?
Obviously that's over.
Think it worked?
How do you think I met her?
And very nice.
She is very hot.
She's worked here about a year maybe a year and a half.
Here's to us.
Then it's a good thing.
Even with my new manager.
So I'm thinking about it.
So I think it's great.
You've got to have your eyes open that's all.
I mean look at me.
Come on do you think I'm doing the right thing?
You've been through it.
I thought you said it was close.
Just a minute!
Yeah that would be a good move.
This is the new one right Chris?
How would you rate this one?
When do we get to drink it?
That's what you do with every one.
Just get a sense of it.
Now we're talking.
Look how beautiful this view is.
What a day!
This week is not about me.
I went on Monday.
It'd be the best thing for you.
You pay too big a price.
It's never free.
That's your problem Miles.
Too early in the morning for that you know what I mean?
And Miles is my best man Mrs.
My main man.
That's a good age.
It's her birthday tomorrow.
Jesus Miles we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
I've just got to make one quick stop.
Did you like that?
How come it's white?
Here's to a great week.
Sounds like you're in to me.
She was supposed to hear something this week but now it's next week and...
It's always like this.
It's always a fucking waiting game.
I've been through it too many times already.
Check out the box.
We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
It's Miles.
I thought this one had a chance but I was wrong.
I'm not anything really.
I'm just his...
And I've been doing just fine.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
I've told him.
I've told him over and over but he's out of control.
Just take me home.
About two-thirty.
Well nice to see you now.
I had class.
I mean yeah I stopped by for a drink.
Hope you like it.
See you around.
I had a good time tonight Miles.
It's like a thing with you.
Just like in high school.
I know how hard it is.
Just to write it even.
but not really.
Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father.
yeah but it's more...
""The Day After Yesterday.
It's like you're a real person now.
You got kids?
Yeah I'd say you're right on the money.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
With the right person.
It might be too late already.
Go get it.
You sure we can open anything?
Anything we want?
She got anything good?
That's what I'm having.
I love that.
How is it?
Well good to see you Miles.
It's a long drive up here.
I finished it.
I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
You want to join us?
Oh yeah Sunday night.
Oh no actually.
I'm doing good good.
Did you lose some weight?
See you over there Miles.
That's wonderful news.
You look happy.
So what's happening with your book?
Could be better.
Could be worse.
So how're you doing?
Yeah he's good that way.
That was big of him.
Kind of hard to believe.
What is his name?
Excellent food too -- you should try it.
I told you I need a drink.
Sir what are you doing?
Not a bar.
About a year.
About four weeks.
What was all that shit you said to me?
See you Miles.
You take care.
No I think it's kind of a stupid game.
I tried it once.
So what are you up to today Miles?
He had to make a phone call.
She said she had a good time too.
We were thinking.
Well you boys do what you want.
I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
We'll see how it goes.
And the kids.
Does she ever answer back?
It makes me feel better.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
This is very important.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...
Tell him to see.
He'll always take care of her.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
On the wall.
Clear for what?
Make sure things are all clear...
And that's the give away.
That's good enough for me.
Have they said anything about our area?
I saw your eyes last night.
It's eleven now.
How do they know it's over?
They think over a hundred thousand.
But we held strong.
How many died?
It came on about two hours ago.
I'm close.
I can feel air.
I'm looking!
He was only a year and half old.
They're right behind the door.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
They already know we're here.
Should we turn off the lights?
I'm sorry what book is this?
Already thought of.
But you could see they hit something.
What does it matter then?
It'll just keep doing this.
Let's get out of the car okay?
You want him coming in the house next time?
It's just for show.
I think someone did.
Did someone save me?
I hope they're doing better than we are.
The family room.
Sounds made up.
What's two?
They said one of two things could happen.
I just asked his name.
Who wrote this book?
They tell you everything in this book.
I'm getting out now.
I have some upstairs.
Is he okay?
You take care of yourself...
It's good advice...
It's left its mark still.
Take them into town.
And three weeks.
But I'll tell you something what I said in their still goes.
You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days...
You can tell me off the record if you need too.
There was someone watching our house last night.
Let me ask you two something.
I would say so.
What was the first thing?
There are none.
They'll find a way in.
They think it might happen all at once.
No money eh?
I'd get down if I were you.
They may be up there now.
What the hell you talking about?
I think that's definitely the word.
Forget the money.
You've got to get these people out of here.
This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
There's nobody coming?
I think we lost 'em.
What friend is that?
Well no not exactly.
I think we ought to get out of here.
Did it seem short to you?
So far that's all I seen in this life.
You're in it now.
You'll never make it.
If they came after me they'll want him too.
This was my father's.
I was looking for you.
I saw him in town and he told me about that business the other night.
I wanted to see it.
But the way it was down there then...
well they made it hard every way they could.
My daddy took it pretty hard.
That was almost nine months ago she wrote.
Letter took a while to find me but when it did it was just the right time.
That I do.
You know where I'll be.
I already did that.
Just like you'd think.
Now we both need help.
How's Mr.
He said he'd...
look into it.
It's one thing to know it...
You must have known that before you came.
that must have been it.
All you had to do was go and we'd never see each other again.
They've been kind to me.
More than enough.
And they were two of them.
Well they're wrong.
I've got my people sitting down there...
I'll be long gone.
Then you could be with all your friends.
In my town when you're looking for someone you ask me.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on.
He's a friend of mine.
I'll be around.
Anybody got any ideas?
All right you buy me a drink.
It never is.
But he's my brother.
You'll have to deal me out on that.
He is that.
Which way do you mean?
It's a town...
It's a great one.
My head spent three years training it.
Get me some clothes.
Thought it was real funny.
I walked for a little while but there was no use so I gave it up.
I had to get up anyway.
I've never been in there.
Not for five years.
You got no idea what they were after?
The next day we'll be back here...
What about the law?
I paid the government for it all right.
You own this land.
They run me off.
She's gone gone to town.
I saw the light.
But I never thought it'd be my boy.
I never thought that.
That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
A lot of men have told me that.
Maybe it's true.
And a pretty lady.
We'll work them together.
Mine starts right over there.
It's all I've ever wanted.
Never will again.
Could have been any one of us.
His son is worse than he was.
There's nothing wrong with the land it's just some of the people.
's done everything he can.
Oh a guy who got run out of town...
He is now.
This a friend of yours?
Yeah that's what happened with me too.
I've got no reason to run.
Sure we are.
I'm done talking.
You wanted to see me?
I want you out of town.
Is there a place in town that takes...
Came to the wrong town.
But go you will and I mean now.
I wanted a drink and a bed.
Are these your friends?
What's all this then?
We'd rather stay.
Why would they stop you?
What makes you think I could?
There's nobody else.
Why come to me?
We have nothing to talk about.
Oh that's just fine.
I'm not sure but I got an idea.
I thought you were done with our family.
Yeah it's working out real good.
I got there just short of too late.
Did you hear his son is still around?
I heard that too.
What about his brother?
He's good all right.
Too good for my men.
That's why you've got to take care of it.
He must be pretty good.
Not a thing.
Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I thought we talked about that.
Yeah maybe I will too.
So we understand each other?
I want you to understand.
Well thanks but forget it.
Just an idea.
It is that.
This is a lot of money.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I just got to town.
You got a place to stay?
But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I can use a guy like you.
I've given that up.
Let's talk about that.
I'm looking for some men.
I'm good for it.
Where's the dog?
How ya doing?
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I'm ready for that.
I've seen a lot of that.
But it's only true if you let it be.
The world is what you make of it.
Is that what he said?
What's he got?
It's not the money.
Not for you.
Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
He left me.
Where's the dog now?
Give me some of the good stuff.
That's the good stuff.
Here he comes right now.
Why'd you go into business with him?
It's the only place I'm happy.
And I know what I'm talking about.
That's what I call it too.
Will you join me Miss --
The world is what you make of it friend.
I run the place.
You work here?
I thought you two would get along.
You got a lot in common.
That was my plan.
I'll take you to her.
We all know what happened.
It was her body of work.
And this Mr.
I'm just trying to understand.
Okay -- for you.
We could never be anything else.
We're just so...
I'm not --  He's not.
But that's not important now.
That's what I want to talk about.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.
it's life.
That sounds wonderful.
I was thinking -- what about you and...
You know what we have to do?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Are you doing that again?
Who says that --?
Of course she will.
But in the morning you'd go back to her.
There's nothing to her.
What woman can?
-- She already is.
Not tonight not ever.
They'll say anything.
I just read somewhere --
Is she really having your baby?
When is she coming over?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is it Wednesday?
It's Wednesday.
Yes you do...
Anyway tonight was a good start.
No of course not!
Would you care if we were?
Is she there?
Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
She said you were very beautiful.
She was there.
She'll never go to them.
I know how much this means to you.
it's why she never goes anywhere never seen in public...
-- I can explain.
It's not a good time.
I'd love to tell her myself.
I should fire you more often.
The film's looking wonderful.
what the hell happened to you?
You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.
I'll walk you out.
She wants all the money up there...
She'll do her own.
Hair and make-up?
Well something has to be done about this budget.
If it's on the page...
Leave the press conference to me.
Out of the question.
As I say she's...
Anyway it means a lot.
They're love letters.
Listen to this one.
If they're good they get known.
They're yours.
The picture's dead.
The board is giving me hell.
Those days in New York...
We used to decide who would play what role.
We told them what to wear what to say who to date.
When they were under contract we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- What's wrong with that?
-- I'll tell you why.
I'm difficult.
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Of course she is.
You look pretty today.
Yes -- oh my God.
Is there any evidence she is?
I know more about her than members of my own family.
So you did meet her?
God it's so like your father.
It was a great show Dad...
I have to talk to her.
Please put your clothes on
""Why are we here?
Why are we here?
Is that a problem?
You're with me to be close to her?
Yes yes again again.
I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Yes of course but very beautiful in your own right.
so much like her?
You look so so...
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the er...
No thank God for you Mr.
And what may I ask brought this on?
Where would you like to start?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
It's very...
Somebody said she was here.
Is she here?
Anyway we got it a couple of takes ago.
Let's move on.
How did the wall get there?
A real wall.
That's why --
a wall between you --
But she's right there!
I must feel her!
He has to!
She's on the line now.
You're so far off!
not the right type?...
I'll try to talk her into it.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.
I'll be dead.
I'll call you about his next week.
You saw that?
Everyone's tried.
You already do.
Not like this --
I've seen them all before.
You have to see her.
It was worth it.
Good and bad.
-- Eight years ago.
In that whole time I never left my computer.
That's got to be --?
It's me Mr.
I have her Mr.
The answer to this.
I did it Mr.
-- Please get away from me.
I told her it was a matter of life and death.
No wonder she never comes to these things!
Can we have a minute?
What I did.
I've got to go Dad.
No that was me.
I can get you something else.
It's from both of us.
Thank her for me.
I love you too daddy.
They have to meet face-to-face.
Dinner's difficult.
A phone call?
How's your love life?
Good-night Daddy.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
It's a nice day.
Let's eat outside.
Where do you meet them?
I know plenty of boys.
You can lose yourself.
You should get out more.
I saw her picture on the er...
Where did you find her?
Is she here tonight?
You know I...
what's her last name?
There was no other way.
Did you really do all the post yourself?
I know you'll do it Dad.
You're better off out of it.
I set her on fire!
This should take care of Mother.
Can we speak off the record?
I'm a fair man.
She looks a lot like you.
I want to see her.
How are you doing it?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.
-- I bet you have.
I know what you're up to.
It gets cold out here at night.
We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.
And you will.
Look it up.
So they're probably here.
The public has a right to know.
And why the hell is she with you?
This is the story.
Is that why she left you?
-- I've been here before!
We used to.
Do you realize what we have here?
What do you want --?
I will when you're finished writing it.
My God you've got one?
We've got our best people on it Mr.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
No of course not you're right.
You know you have a line here.
You know you're really very good.
I take back what I said.
I mean you're really good.
Yes I'd like that.
Would you like me to read?
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Then show some.
They'll shut me down!
She's already here.
No one came in or went out just like you said Mr.
I certainly am Mr.
I'll do anything to please you Mr.
Why do you have to bring that up?
It's worth it.
Well I think we've done enough for today.
How about you and me go out on the town?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
after your next picture.
Is that better Mr.
And now look what you've started.
All I wanted to do was finish the film.
I am the death of real.
Maybe he can.
They're paying for it.
And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You mean they buy it?
I just needed to do a couple of things.
And I needed to tell you something.
Why did you leave me?
--Do I know you?
They called you their son.
Do you know how important this is?
This is big time.
I'm off then.
You know that's probably not the best idea.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back?
Show you what I got?
It's not a problem.
Thought maybe you want to come.
Show me how to buy at these things.
And you know what else?
I think we said everything we needed to say.
Maybe it's time to say things to someone else?
Someone close to you?
Where will you go where no one has died?
I wish I were somewhere else.
I believe both of you now.
And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You believe now?
I think that's right!...
I think they all want that.
No one asked them.
It's just gone...
You really look better.
You believe me right?
Someone else can help you.
Someone else can make you happy.
You're the only one who can help me.
I told you what I want.
What do you want more than anything?
Can I ask you then?
Are they all standing up?
I thought the play was excellent.
How often do you see them?
Your eyes told me.
What makes you think that?
Hey that's good.
Maybe they run out of gas.
The long drive went on--
If we could change something in your life anything at all what would you like that to be?
Something I want?
Think about what you want from our time together.
What kind of words?
What'd you write?
I was just thinking the same thing.
She died a long time ago.
What about Mrs.
You hate him?
Yes I do have a question.
You want to ask me a question?
How do you draw now?
They had a meeting.
We were supposed to draw a picture.
Anything we wanted...
If it's okay with you?
You're my very first client back.
I try to help them figure things out.
Nothing bad can happen in a church right?
Oh lots of things I suppose.
Bad people for one.
No just one.
They're my dad's.
She wanted me to tell you--
I would never think that about you...
They talk to you?
They want me to do things for them.
Standing next to my window.
You can see her?
I'd give anything to have been there.
There's only two of us.
So who moved it?
It just gets moved.
It's not for playing.
Anything bad about me?
Lots of things.
Stop looking at me.
How did you--?
It makes them feel bad.
You talked funny when you went to school here.
You talked funny all the way to high school!
They used to hang people here.
She always knew what was wrong.
Knew just what to say.
Who said it was...
Worked pretty good...
You ever hear of...
Let's say today we make it your business.
You know what he did.
How'd he know I'd come?
dead in 'em.
maybe three days.
What's a ""little while?
Could take a little while though.
I'm coming back up!!!
You any good with those?
Which street corner?
I have to get back to my job.
I'm almost done!
He should turn that music down.
is a real one.
or about you.
Your job is to keep us on the road!
I thought you said two hundred.
if in fact he's really dead.
Be that way.
You're out.
We need to get the hell out of here!
what does it do?
Let me get this straight...
I am not!
You're out of your mind man.
Well there goes our record deal.
The night of the fire.
You were only six years old.
-- It's not me!
People no one would miss?
know what people say.
all my life.
What do you want to know.
You'll be back.
So they say.
She was talking about...
You got it wrong boy.
I'll be fine here.
This is his room...
After the fire...
How did she...
was she ""called?
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
But I always said you'd come back.
My boy was taken from me...
far as I'm concerned he's dead.
-- Who are you?!
Now: who are you?
I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Is that all you ever think of?
Which one you like better?
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Throw me one.
You were behind.
here I come!
He started it.
Sorry wrong answer!
Yeah that's right!
I'm taking a break.
That's just the problem.
Well some of it.
One week from today.
I almost thought for a second...
You've been...
Not without you --
I'm part of it.
let's get out of here.
You kept us here...
You brought us here.
You and your father.
-- You're not making sense!!
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
You want to talk about this?
-- Where is everyone?
How'd you get that?
came in here last night.
We're almost ready.
What the hell are you doing out here?
I said that's enough!
Think of it...
We'll be careful of the bed --
I was never allowed up here...
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Then why go back now?
Nothing to tell.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Time for a little...
He's cut all the phone lines.
he tried to get it on with me.
Just like a man...
never around when you need them.
-- Where have you two been?
It's coming right up.
Hold it hold it.
What is it?!!
But next time it would be nice...
Bill we need to talk!
And this is mine.
It's my nature.
You took Bill.
I'll get it for you.
He wants me Bill!
Just get away when you get the chance.
When you wanted to run away I called your dad.
And when I turned eleven or twelve things...
well they got worse.
I knew it was just to see me.
I know what people say Bill.
Remember back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
I should have told someone right away...
This time I could --
Your best chance of doing that is with me.
I can talk to him --
Bill I heard what you're doing.
I think I should go along.
Maybe she's ever called the house or --?
I've seen them so many times before.
What you up to?
We're coming your way man!
Is that what you're saying Bill?
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
There was something I wanted to tell you...
I got to leave my post.
Come pick us up.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Otherwise they'll go straight down it.
Stuff you can never imagine.
Everyone knows that.
Hell I was game!
Was then even more so now.
How many you need?
What can I do you for?
I'll get if for you.
Said I should be fine in a couple days.
What happened to your --?
You're pretty.
I remember it.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Him and most these other ones around here.
It's just a work thing.
He took him over.
Now he's here.
He went in Mr.
What other stuff?
But not always.
I was -- He was...
other stuff too.
Maybe you better sit back down.
Where'd he go?
You paying for the gas?
Four hundred cases worth.
But like all good things...
That man is your father?!?
One to five.
One to five?
The minute you see him you'll know.
What kind of a guy is he?
My very words.
And her sister.
We were together for almost a year.
I thought he was it.
You take the front I'll take the back.
Then let's change the subject.
Do I know?
I'm an authority on it.
Let's hit it.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You might have said no.
You could've asked.
I wanted to go on with you.
I would've come back for you.
I've never seen him before in my life.
I'm just trying to help you out.
He's after us again!
What the hell are you doing?!?
Good for a hundred miles.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
I've been sitting a long time.
The bus'll pick you up over there.
Believe me there's nothing to be afraid of.
I forget to tell you.
I give up.
Eyes on the road.
I never looked at it that way.
Who'd want to?
You sure do.
But you'll do it?
And I need it bad.
I'm coming through.
But they're waiting for me.
When we agree to do a job we do it.
We've come this far.
Green lights and white lines all the way.
-- How we doing?
What's the weather like?
We'll be waiting.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Pick me up.
We're gone.
I hate to say it...
What's your twenty?
On its way.
Now where the hell are you?
I hate to say I told you so.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Let's keep it that way.
No one's here.
He's history.
Why are we doing this?
Keep both feet on the floor.
We'll be moving ninety and over.
Two is one.
If I say go to two it's really one.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to twenty-one go to nineteen.
And within the law.
No one's ever done it before.
Look it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Twenty-eight hours!
Thanks for the break.
About one to five years worth.
Have any trouble getting here?
Seventy-two five.
Good for him.
How's your twenty?
What's he...
Where the hell are you?
Now you just find him son.
-- Yeah I heard.
-- so you shut them off?
And everybody all the time.
That's happening in about ten minutes.
All of 'em.
I think we should move.
He's giving them up?
I've seen in happen a hundred times.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Six months now and we're just seeing this?
Maybe he's that good.
Did he give you his name?
Do you know where is he now?
Two of 'em?
But there were more of you?
Pretty much yep.
We -- yeah I know.
Yeah shit -- hell you're right.
Man that's great.
Oh hell yeah.
We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
If I needed your I.
I'm here where's the car?
and the amount you're doing.
Are you on a land line?
What do we got...?
Yeah we've been through that.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Do you want me to say I did it?
Now the money question...
I could have it sent out...
Now do you know anything about that?
What did you say!?
What did you say!
No what did you say on the machine?
I said I got his machine.
I got his machine.
I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.
You'll walk with me.
That's probably him now...
is an end.
But you did and have...
And now people are dead.
and did you make another deal?
So you made another deal?
Yeah fifty-three.
When did you know all this?
He does now...
Does he know?
You're finished.
-- You can and you will.
We have to transport Mr.
What the hell -- What is this!?
Difficult to explain everything now...
This is him?
He's a doctor?
It's the last place they'd look.
How are we on time...?
Yeah I can front this.
That's not a problem.
-- who can say.
No question no you're right.
We're in a power position.
I feel like I know you girl.
Got hit twice.
You love her?
-- never in a million girl --
You know I did baby...
Maybe spend the night?
You my road dog.
You got the fifty up?
He said that the shit could get hot could get heavy...
I said good.
Right now what we got --  -- Is a number and a name...
Is that for real?
And you're not?
Who am I then?
You'll end up like me.
Can it work?
Twenty four hours a day until they're back on Earth.
Leave the light off.
Did you call him?
And I want to win.
Why would you let her to do that?
She'll come back.
She was gone.
Why did you agree to come here?
We're done.
There's something wrong with him.
Who are you talking about?
With her probably.
Where's his body?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Now: What happened to him?
Who here could possibly care what you want?
They've never even been in space.
And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Then I'll come out.
Maybe you can.
Oh right away.
That's why you never saw me with anyone.
I miss him though.
Then what will you do?
Who are you trying to please?
Which her this one or that one.
Can you face both?
So: Leave with her.
Should we check?
What do you want to do leave the station with her?
Just get him to stop.
She knows everything?
Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
She knows everything.
She knows who she is.
Oh this one you love?
They build up with experience.
Perhaps it did.
But why is it doing what it's doing?
Given it's resources it could have done anything.
-- we are not sure of that.
But in person this time.
We have found God.
You'll need to do something.
What will you say?
Told you what?
I wish you'd told me.
Will she come back?
It started about three months ago.
We were ready to go home.
Day and night.
She was real.
Where did she come from?
Why who did you see?
Is there anybody else here?
He'll let me in.
well I've been thinking about it.
Just stay with me.
How can you be here...
Where did you go before?
I've decided that if it is God it's a sick God.
How can I not hate something that does that?
What does it want?
Do you want yours?
What are you taking?
All I see is you.
Am I really her?
It put you here.
And there you were.
I think they help.
They do something to me.
It's hard to think straight.
Is that really what you want?
But then I would be dead now.
It was exactly like mine.
There was something else.
Is it like yours?
Yes you are --
Who are you then?
I keep telling you.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Chris I'm serious.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris I had to.
You should have told me.
I want every second I can get with you.
You've always known that.
It's just watching.
How can I tell?
You've seen both of me.
I only know what you're like here.
You're all I know.
There is no ""You"" from before.
We're different.
What's happening to us?
But he was here...
You said he was dead.
He was here.
If you're here.
Do you want to stay here?
But that's what happened before.
Not any of it.
That's all I know right now.
That's what you were saying.
I heard what you were saying.
It's all around me.
Was she right?
Why did she do it?
I'm different.
What's wrong.
Do I really feel like...
He does have a point.
He has a point.
I'm putting that in my next report.
You sure say ""God"" a lot when we're doing it.
How could she not be real?
She does exactly what she did...
it's not possible.
I like that too.
I really like fucking you.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
You know this.
You know where it comes from.
Why did you say those things?
What happened to us exactly?
I did too.
Like I was something to be...
She was afraid she'd be seen.
I knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on.
What kind of look?
How old were you?
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
You were trying to break down the door.
Do you know why?
As I said then it's God right?
It can do this it can do that!
It's something.
Then it's God right?
But not until you mentioned them.
What do you remember?
How about I feel better when you take them?
You're better when you take them.
Please come with me.
I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
I'll just be a minute.
Of what I remember about Earth...
it's all one thing now.
You want it coming back with us?
I got rid of him.
I wanted to see if...
I wanted to be the only one.
We want to talk about...
Listen I'll...
see you again.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Everyone's all right...?
He wants you.
Forget about you.
I'd miss my life...
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I'll think about Wednesday.
I'll be fine really.
Listen you're right.
I'll just...
Can you come?
When is it?
When can I see you?
I thought maybe you could come...
You should see me on the street you'd think I was the First Lady --"
Oh God that's great!
Oh I do want to know.
You told her?
Okay then let's make it easy.
what is this?
There's nothing else...
Everything's okay...
They called here after you left...
A couple of days?
I do care about you!
Stop will you?!
I'll have to leave the country!
Let me in...
Open the door will you?
It was nice having you ""watch over me""...
You could do better.
Tell it like it is.
I saw you with a dog in my mind.
With a child and a dog...?
So it was ""love"".
the minute I saw her...
Do I tell you your business.
Yeah I like that!
Where you go I follow.
Want to go out for a drink?
You know why they're like that...?
You put it back in the wrong place...
never finished one yet.
I hate these things.
Yeah what a woman.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Not too sure about that.
I got money.
Put it on my account please.
Would you pick one out please?
Maybe you'll stop by...
He made the point several times.
It's at home.
There's a phone in the car.
I'm supposed to call in.
Can we go then?
I'm not sure how this works.
I have to go out...
is that all right?
It's okay...
Well of course we'd be...
You're planning to speak?
What am I supposed to do?!
And I saw who did it!
And I'm making mine.
We all do --
just saying you should think twice about it...
Sure we are let's go!
Did you get him?
He'll live through it.
They all live through it.
I'd like you to get your stuff out.
I do love you.
And you are a lady.
Get away from me...
She means that much to you you stay with her.
But you come back you come back for me.
Let me drive...
You talked to his wife?
I already did.
I mean I talked to his wife and she talked to him...
To be home for dinner.
be home for dinner...
This'll be over soon.
What did you watch?
What did you do tonight?
What're you talking about --
Did you hear what I said?!!
I set her up.
I saw it coming.
Should I wait up?
Coming to bed?
She bought it.
Did she buy it or did you?
You went to a party with her?
Ninety-seven five right?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day.
We'll see the house another time okay?
I might stop you.
He might get out.
Oh some shit.
What took you?
Well actually she looks better than that.
You know what that means.
So how'd it go?
You got no idea...
Tomorrow I start looking for our house...
Get in bed.
We can afford it now.
Call me next week.
We'll talk about it.
It should've been me...
I heard a lot...
But I got him!
okay let's check it out.
What about when she goes out?
They'd do just as good a job.
Until she I.
No I need'm now!
Get the cars!
At my house...!
He's good at this.
You in this with me?
How do you like it so far?
Does it make you...
Help me out here could you please leave.
I'll take his place all right?
Under the table.
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
Put him under the table!
Let her come in!
Then stand at the door so we can see you.
She'll do what I say.
Why should she come in?
I'll bring her in.
You let them go and I'll bring her in.
How do I know that's her?
I brought the girl.
She's outside.
I want to help you out of this.
So what are you doing tonight?
No I'm not coming in.
How about dinner tonight?
""  Where does he get this?
I know where everything is.
What're we having?
Peter-- you took this picture?
It's no business of yours either way.
-- no I mean...
I mean we both...
Nonot really.
If I ever get out from under.
You stop him?
Ah ya know.
Same old stuff.
-- but they got it all wrong.
No no listen.
Hey guy get back here!
I saw him too.
I got you a present.
But you're my only friend...
do you hate me?
I've got one too.
Your feet are on fire.
But let me give you one little piece of advice...
be a good guy.
Oh look Mr.
That's not even close.
Now tell me you love me.
But they're not-- I was in--
I got a question college boy.
What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?
Pick it up later.
Can we make it a hundred?
The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
You're making my life difficult.
Week from tomorrow.
Are you quite finished?
I'm still getting the hang of this.
Some things you should say anyway.
he wanted to be found.
It's as if he's somewhere else...
I'm only getting a piece of him.
Well I like you too.
I'm here...
I always thought she was a strong person.
She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
May's much better.
She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes.
Earth to Peter.
I'm not so sure.
I used to be sure of a lot of things.
You're just...
You'd feel what?
None of us are...
I mean, sometimes I...
Okay, let's say you had gone back.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.
I could've done something.
Do you mind if I come too?
I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.
Maybe I can get my money back.
What's in the bag?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
I've got no problems.
Maybe I should, too--
What are you doing this weekend?
You should write that one down.
But you like that in a man?
Really gets to you if you let it.
I could have stopped it though.
Well I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
We'll see ya.
It's a lot of ground to cover.
We'll try.
I know him.
You sure about all this?
Tell me what--
Absolutely no class.
Oh not that.
It'll shut itself off.
Do you have a date?
It's Friday night...
I am old enough to--
Listen I'm serious--
What I've done is--
With more power I could--
Let's talk in the hall.
Life and death matter.
Yours-- everyone's.
I have work.
But he has got a point.
The paper my boy.
I'd like to speak with him.
The right place at the right time.
I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Need any more help?
Not a lot.
What exactly happened?
Peter what can I do for you?
Question is can you do it again?
I just gave-- yeah sure.
Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Sure in the war.
I'm not so happy myself.
put him away.
live around here?
Imagine how I feel.
You're sure you're all right.
I sent for  the police.
We can explain.
He'll be back here.
Like you did yesterday.
Looks good outside.
What's left of it.
The point is what do you do with him?
Every one of us.
Just one of the boys.
They do this type of thing.
You on their team now?
You think I'm the guy?
We'll get some more.
There's only one pair left.
That'll do.
We're looking at it.
What are you looking at him for?
You put two and two together and it comes out four.
Let's get on with what?
What is this anyway?
Yeah what about it?
A little something what?
And maybe a little something else?
With ten percent of the take.
You tell him Price.
You would would you?
Dog eat dog.
The price has gone up.
Then we're all in on it?
Looks like he's finished.
How did he get over there?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Break it off!
That's the general idea.
Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Which one of you is what?
How did you get the information?
Who's giving it to you?
Which one of us is it?
I do not understand.
We're on to you.
Such nice boys!
It makes me sick to --
Maybe he would.
Do we know each other?
Oh come now!
You will remember the name?
Of course you did!
I hate music.
I'm okay here.
I'll live.
What is your number?
It houses seventy-five men.
You were saying --?
All I know is he did it.
This is water?
All of you!
I got a deal for you.
You should live so long.
And I will go back!
Some are not bad at all.
You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
I want to draw.
You want to go?
I've seen every picture you've ever made six times.
So go away!
I'll open mine too.
I'll open mine now.
Got a little something for you!
You hold him.
I'll get him yet.
This is a good one!
Shut up everybody!
' What do you know!
So it's better than no letter at all.
What do they always say?
I'll get you over there!
Cut it out.
Not for me!
There's other women!
The top of your head.
Who wants to eat?
I'm your baby!
I said say it again.
You can say that again!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
You will not get them.
Why is this man being taken out?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Is that asking too much?
I said we're all in on it.
I want everybody out of here.
Let's get it over with.
Come on everybody!
You must get out.
For your own good you must get out.
We got them last year.
You could use a new one yourself.
When I go I want you to give me five minutes.
It's our only chance to cut through.
How do they know?
You starting that again?
Sure I heard it.
We did it.
I'll say it is.
What's the matter boys?
You take it out.
I was having dinner.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Maybe just one word?
Stop that will you!
So what good is it?
How long can he last?
I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
I never did and I never will.
I thought that's what you said.
What about the radio?
I'd worry more about the radio.
I'll tell you how come.
That's how come.
Just one little thing.
Now you've done it.
We have no radio.
Give me the radio.
Let us see.
Such nice boys.
I'd better not talk about it.
How many do you want?
I do not know anything!
I'll make it five hundred!
The one you work with.
You should go and see the doctor.
How do you look?
That's why I like you!
And how's Mrs.
It is not me.
I am your friend.
I am your best friend here.
That is my wife.
Tell you what to do.
Then get yourself another face.
You heard him.
Have a nice time over there?
Twelve years sir.
Can you project its course?
This is its current position.
But I did not deal with it sir.
It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
I think something is wrong
I just got it.
It was very funny.
You get what?
What do you feel?
But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I am quite...
We're within range sir.
I'm already there remember?
I'll need help.
Together we could-
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I know exactly where I want to go and when.
I have to stop him.
If you leave you can go anywhere any time.
Yes where would you go?
Why would you want to leave?
These are my children...
I am also here.
A part she left behind.
But I never had a wife children a home like this.
This is where you wanted to be.
But I do remember how it felt.
It's important that you tell me what you know.
It might give him enough power to-
Do you remember him?
That might break them free.
Well may we have a look around?
Did we do it?
Did we make a difference?
She's not real either is she?
Nothing here is.
No no it's not.
And in the end what did it get me?
As I said this is some kind of-
Yes yes it is.
I always do.
Keep her together until I get back.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough you make the time.
When did he find the time for a family?
And what would that be sir?
You should have a doctor take a look at it.
I told you everything.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.
Yeah they're full of great ideas.
What has she told you about me?
You have information and I need it.
Normal is what everyone else is and what you are not.
You may still.
Maybe they're not out there.
Sir is there anything wrong?
That will be all.
Thank you Number One.
Make it so.
Imagine what it was like Will.
Aye aye sir.
Let's see what's out there.
In a way he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
I know exactly when I'm needed.
Actually I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
This is the only one.
Of course you could always come with me.
We're doing the best we can.
Nothing for me.
I do not see how.
It looks like we're too late.
When do we get paid off...?
He has been here for some time.
Where the hell is he!
Will they join us or fire on us...?
Continue on course...
No one has time for those who only stand...
Wait a minute...!
I'll put you down next time around.
Not from here no.
It has to be.
I went wrong.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come...
It's David.
I'll go...
How many have died?
And what is yet to come?
My mother knew nothing about it.
That may be difficult...
My god what happened to them?
Coming up on sector three...
There's only one thing it could be...
Like your father...
I know but -- let's do it by the book.
What would you ah like to do next?
Come in please...
Everyone else find a station!
Just him sir!
How many more?
I've got no control over anything!
The rest of you do not.
Eight weeks sir.
I'm almost done sir.
But that may not be possible.
Only one thing Sir...
He gave his life to save us.
That is all I know.
And someone else.
David with you?
Why would you do this...?
You would have done the same for me.
My father says you have been my friend...
You came back for me.
And I know you.
I know you...
Do I not?
It's been a while sir.
Tell him we're coming in.
If I read this right sir we have full power.
The word is no.
The word sir?
Oh I'll have ""Mr.
That's the good news.
Would you look at that?
I just had to try.
Then let me speak to the Council!
Out of the question!
As surely as if it were my own!
I'm not even sure I believe.
You are my best officer and if I had a best friend you'd be that too.
May I ask why...?
That's out of the question.
We think her day is over...
Ah too bad...
Give me your hand and we both live.
That's the way it shall be!...
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
I'm looking forward to meeting you.
You have one minute.
Give me a chance --
I meant what I said.
Who I am is not important.
That I have them is.
I will let you speak to them.
Who is this?!
But at what cost?
What I have done I had to do.
Only time will answer.
I thank you.
What you have done is --
What you ask is difficult.
What must I do?
Surely he would have found a way!
and I understand.
Then everything that he was...
Everything that he knew...
It is not here.
and always shall be...
Or the one.
The needs of the few...
May I join your mind?
Your son meant more to me than you can know.
Yes I was...
You missed the point then and now...
And you were the last one to be with him.
I -- saw no future --
Met his death""?
I have been to your Government.
I give two minutes.
How can you tell that?
Sir may I suggest --
If it works.
Perhaps their information --
Sir may I --
Yes my lord!
Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
How is that...?
Now you can do both at the same time!
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I feel young Doctor.
You okay Jim?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Do you have anything to eat?
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
There may still be time...
you gave as good as you got.
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend Jim.
What DO you want?
You know this has nothing to do with age.
Now look at me over the top.
For your eyes.
Four hundred years old.
I'm almost afraid to.
Twenty-two eighty-three...
They'll learn.
I'm sorry you feel that way Doctor.
Who gave the order?
All went well.
Nothing has happened.
Has something happened?
Do you read us?
come in please.
On my birthday.
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before...
You did this -- in a day?!
How can you ask me that?
You had your world and I had mine.
It's just to keep them busy.
Please help us Jim...
what's wrong?
Can you read me?
What we did in there -- we did in a day.
So are we it looks like.
Mother go back!
We must have order here.
Does that about do it?
That's exactly the --
I know I know...
Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today.
But maybe it IS something they can...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you?
But the child --
What's the matter --?
I told you I saw a --
I saw it --!
You know what she'll say...
I would think so sir.
OUT OF LOVE.
Is that what you came here to say?
I was wrong about you.
I'm trying David.
But good words.
Maybe you should listen to them.
It was just words.
Not like this -- no.
I know nothing.
That makes two of us.
I suppose I was.
Would you like it?
Are you running away from me?
She's making it up!
Oh I believe it.
Only half of you would get there.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Sir we must!
Careful: Not all at once.
It is very cold in space.
I take your point.
Of course I remember you.
All is well sir.
We're waiting.
Do you mean he...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
I never forget a face.
I never thought to see your face again.
I say again.
Do it while we have time.
I'm trying sir.
On your way.
I seem to remember it myself.
You're well?
It's two hours.
Are you about ready?
Not at present.
Let's have it.
Is the word given?
Oh do you?
And who is this?
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend...
the good of the few...
But from where...?
Best we could do in two hours.
What IS working around here?
Be careful Jim...
All right join the party.
Who knew just where to hit us?
They knew just where to hit us.
It would explain a great many things --
What's she doing here?
The tape was made a year ago.
What in God's name does that mean?
I'd best talk with Mr.
Yes we've been through death and life together.
Certainly they have come to know you.
and where are you off to now?
By the way thank you for this.
So you said at the time.
All is well.
As you were Mr.
Time from my mark...
All stop sir.
Hold your course.
That was close --
I changed the conditions of the test.
On the test sir will you tell me what you did?
I'd really like to know.
As your teacher Mr.
Stage Two of what?
Take the test again.
I did not think so.
May I speak sir?
Then you have something new to think about.
It has not.
there was no way to win.
Fire when ready.
Sir you did it.
I've looked forward to this for a long time.
I really must thank you.
By the book...
Take her out Mr.
Very well Mr.
They do indeed.
Where must you go?
But as my son you have them.
The Computer knows that.
I do not understand the final question...
You -- sent them away.
You gave me things to think about.
I feel the same thing.
I've known you too long.
How're you doing?
What did you have in mind...?
They did it.
What did you say she was getting?
Jim you've got to let me go in there!
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
-- That's the general idea.
Take us home...
It'll come back to him.
You're saying...
So what is your problem?
That is what I said Doctor.
You really have gone where no man has gone before.
Life Death Life...
Things of that nature?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It gives me a great sense of history.
May I go now?
I do not know your name.
The top of what?
Let's take it from the top.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
What is your plan?
That's odd.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
The hell they did.
I suppose they told you that...?
They like you very much.
You have no right to be here!
How will I find you?
You have a point...
Oh my God we're too late!
Or even tell you how much you've meant to us...
They were taken last night.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you.
It's all real.
Is any of this real?
what you said...
In the park?
If you change your mind this is where I'll be.
and better for them.
There we are.
Now will you tell me something?
Okay, your friend was right.
Well, I was close.
What are you, a doctor?
So that, as they say, is that.
What do you mean now?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Where could you take them?
And that's the last you'll see of them?
How will that be done, exactly?
Nobody knows that.
See you later, old friend.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Please, just -- let me finish.
I want to know how you know that.
Well, that's something.
What does that mean, exactly?
Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there?
You've already been that.
I buy that.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We were only trying to help...
You mean man...
So I will...
Will you help us?
We've been so lucky.
We can only wait for their call.
What about team two?
They have a right to be...
Do you think they'll help us?
You've done it before.
And another thing...
That's simply the way they talk here.
Now what's your question?
How do you know this...?
That one should do.
Surely you can be more specific...
Earth of the past.
The sounds but not the language.
To the on-board computer room.
Let's see what she's got Mr.
I have no control sir!
Hang on sir...
Nine point seven...
Nine point two...
Nine point three...
Continue on course.
You'll find him...
I should never have left him...
Now look: I want you all to be very careful.
From a city?
It's under water!
On my way...!
You better get up there sir.
Full power sir.
Stand by sir.
I'll try sir.
You've got to do better!
It'll be well into tomorrow.
I thought I told you never to call me --
Give me a round figure Mr.
They're giving out.
And remember: two of them.
That should be enough.
We're ready sir.
Give me one more day sir.
I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.
I thought you should know.
You will be in good hands here.
would that be worth something to you eh?
Ah what else indeed?
What else would I be working with?
Well that's different.
Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
All right then this is old stuff to you.
Oh here and there.
Tell her I feel fine...
Yes of course...
They are my friends.
Most kind Father.
You are my son.
I wanted to take my leave of you.
Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Wait my son.
Yes this must be true.
You talk funny.
I'm sorry my son.
I'll be here.
I plan on using them.
Mother and son.
We can hold them off a long time...
once we get there...
But they will not make it easy to get there...
For someone so young.
In three hundred years...
When time seemed to stop...
and you could almost live in that moment...
stop planning for tomorrow...
until you find...
If you stay long enough that'll change.
This is a school...
There are days.
Not just from you but from my people as well.
I suppose you're seventy-five.
I understand how you feel.
I have to go home now.
I want to stay with you...
No one's ever asked me that before.
then I'm it.
Sometimes I do.
Perhaps that is true.
Do you like being a machine?
I am better.
And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Very good Doctor.
in fact they're better than fine.
We should all be so lucky.
And our people?
Will he live?
I believe the boy is...
that looks like them.
It is over.
It is not over.
Do you really believe he'll listen?
need I go on?
Take me down.
The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Six hundred people.
How many people would it take...
You know what that makes us?
There are six hundred people down there.
You're not finished here?
I wish I had better news.
That's probably not a good idea.
we'll need their help...
What you're asking me to do...
We've come a long way together.
Moving them is one thing.
that would take time...
We're not waiting until morning...
It may not last after we leave.
If not I just wanted before we go...
There was something right with my eyes.
In a sense that's all he knew.
So you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
you could hear that?
but then again it might not.
If it works you mean.
There'll be no cover-up of this.
Not after I get...
There's a short letter I left you all just some...
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
A small group of us set off to find a new home...
That was three hundred and nine years ago.
No we're here to...
Would you like something to eat?
We're trying to get to you sir...
can hear you...
I'm on my way...
We're on our way.
We'll take an hour.
Oh it's just something my mother used to...
Take us in.
That's not in here...
And usually does.
I believe you...
Got a minute?
Why would we be involved with these people?
You should feel right at home with them.
What are they interested in...?
We're fine sir.
It will take some...
time to explain.
and only lost fifteen of our own.
You want some advice?
You know exactly what I mean.
Nothing can change that.
That might not be so bad...
If they're not...
You think they're still up there?
But I had a little help.
It was an experience.
He's a different story.
That'll be interesting.
But until then you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Let's hope so.
There must be some good people...
even in this time.
You have to remember...
It may not be that simple.
What are we waiting for?
They might have a hospital...
But he's been dead for three hundred...
Why the hell are we --
We have two...
Do you have one?
Let me into your mind.
no it's so...
give it back...
I need it...
is to yourself.
and we can be together...
Have you ever know a woman?
I wish to...
go back to the way I was.
do not want this...
Have they given you what I have given you?
Did they even try?
That is not true.
They have tried to help me.
They're not your friends...
they've held you back...
How does it feel?
What year is it?
Bring us about.
I am the beginning...
I am the one who is many.
are you sure you're all right?
I found her to be a most...
Outside around back.
I told you there's no --
"" What the hell are you talking about?
what the hell are they doing?
Well I feel a whole lot better with them out there.
We may need some help.
I'm on it...
As they used to say...
What's still there?
She's a very...
let her in.
Ready to make a little history?
I think I may know how to find them.
so far nothing.
if I knew what it looked like.
This must be it.
We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight.
and Earth will never be the same again.
I am a space-man.
And you know all this...
who are they?
Where do they come from?
Something wrong with that?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Lucky for him you came by when you did.
He might be dead now.
I wanted to see how he was doing.
There's a few of us left.
Used to be anyway.
Where are you from most recently?
here and there.
And you are?
This may be hard for you to understand...
any more than is absolutely necessary.
just take me with you.
It's a lot further than that.
That would take five minutes.
Why are you being so difficult?
It'll take five minutes.
I believe that one.
That's one.
Okay let's hear it.
I'd say you already have.
But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
How did you know about that?
Were the two of you...
I'm an old friend...
for a straight answer.
but sometimes I feel that way.
You'd have to try real hard.
There were three of them...
Did you need something?
I'm very sorry.
Take care of him.
He's a very special man.
We have to follow them back...
We'll cover them.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Then make it so.
Normally I would agree.
They did it...
They must've done it in the past...
they went back and changed history...
I'll keep that in mind.
It would be...
I remember it made me sick.
We just lost main power...
I'm not sure what's --
we have a problem.
I think that's all.
That's the question -
Or not to be -
Jim she's ready!
They may need a doctor.
If they're even looking for us...
You see this?
Jim leave me - I'm finished...
More than ever.
Still think we're finished?
What is it with you anyway?
Somebody felt much worse.
And I'm starting to understand why.
We're not finished.
What a way to finish.
We've been set up all along.
He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Like this one.
I tried to save him!
Then let me help!
Are those your words?
And what did they tell you?
Would you have known if she had?
Take them away.
He just tried to save him!
He's a DOCTOR!
My God what happened here?
I'm not sure how to take that.
She's here - somewhere.
Where IS the conference?
I know what you mean...
Just the size of my head -
Quite right Mr.
I mean given their situation -  Aye sir.
Do we report this sir?
We must do this again soon.
The evening has been most...
you have my thanks..
I shall look forward to it.
He's the one!!
I like it here...
They'll be here...
Your friends are late...
Where do we come in?
It IS possible.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Anyway somebody up there wants you out of the way.
How did you know...?
Stand DOWN Mr.
Win lose or draw it will be on your record.
Who is ""US?
I hope you're happy.
I always wanted to try that.
As you were.
When does this conference start?
How many of those things are there?
I'm afraid we may need more than that.
I know I was.
What's she waiting for?
I am only -
I SHOULD have been -
I knew about HER - and I did nothing.
You might have died.
Why would they give them to us?
I've been dead before.
So that's it..
Perhaps you're right.
I will go.
Never been this close.
I believe you.
For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Not as yet sir.
Such things have happened before sir.
Her own father...?
How did you -?
I do not think so.
Three years is...
- could take weeks sir.
I believe I am.
This one can.
Too far off.
Very near us.
Not from us!
And if they're still in place?
That could take hours!
We'll have to check every one of them Mr.
I think  not.
It's as I said Mr.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
And they'd be right.
What exactly does that mean?
We've been at war a long time.
How long is that?
Can I move now?
Can you remember our father?
I am in a room with lights.
Do you know where you are?
I am your brother.
You are me.
I was in space for a long time.
They asked me where I came from.
Yes please continue.
Not tonight I have work here.
Nothing but question day and night...
They're kids!
How far we've come.
Let me know if you need anything.
That was another time.
He might come after you first.
How long does he have?
I wish I could believe that Doctor.
Right now you're the man you've made yourself.
He's someone else.
Is he very much like you were?
He turned out all right.
You're working late.
Keep on it.
About twenty-five years ago.
When was he...
You are needed here.
To be better than I am.
How can you be sure?
No sir it is not possible.
But even if they were he would not be me.
But so much is the same.
and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do.
I do not agree.
We're about to find out...
only one way to go.
Would you like me to drive?
What do you imagine this is?
We'll find a way off together.
It'll only work for one of us.
Let's see what she can do.
If I were...
I would ""miss you.
This is the only home I have ever known.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
You do not look like me.
You are looking at me.
Why am I looking at me?
No I do not mind.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you.
Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
An individual more like you you mean.
Do you have a name sir?
I would like to pick you up now.
May I do that?
Why is it moving?
But how can he?
I know how he thinks.
How can you be certain?
I need you at my side.
Now more than ever I...
and he is me!
He very much wants to know you.
The same way you want to know him.
Of course sit down.
Do you have a moment sir?
The hell you will.
You know too much about me as it is...
To leave all of this behind and be with me.
You're not here.
I'll always be with you now.
Can you feel my hands...
are they real?
He can never know you as I know you...
This is so good.
All of this I knew...
Do you have life support?
I'll take care of it sir.
How long until he can fire?
Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
If it happens again we want to be ready.
There'll be another after me.
And another after that.
That will never happen.
To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Your new chair sir.
To find the head sir?
What are you afraid of?
We can only hope so.
Can anything be done for him?
They must be behind him.
Thank you sir...
I think it's worth a look.
Still well on our side...
You can still make a choice!
Make the right one now!
That's your life...
But you want to.
So if I gave you my life what would you do with it?
Or could you change?
A father's words you never heard?
Could you do that?
He is what his life has made him!
He is better than that!
I see more than what you are.
I'm what you see now.
Your hands your eyes your nature are the same as mine.
You know that's not possible.
Had you lived my life you'd be doing exactly as I am.
Oh but it does.
If your issues are with me...
I see the man I will never be.
So what am I?
What's this all about?
You may go.
I'm trying to believe you.
There is that.
With a full head of hair.
But I had spent my whole life...
I want to know  where I come from.
You can tell me about my past.
But I'm trying to understand them now.
To live up to them.
To live up to you.
I have no reason to.
The eyes have it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Or just the one of us.
We need to talk just you and I.
You know I do.
No one knew what to do.
I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
There's so much we have to talk about.
On the world I come from there's no light.
Then set a course for Earth.
She is here.
FULL STOP AND FIRE!
A matter of hours now.
Do as I tell you!
Find her again.
We should act.
I have some personal business.
We should have.
It's still the full price.
I'll have to run your card off now.
Fill this out.
I'll take that.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person forty-nine fifty for two.
You speak better than a lot of people I know.
Well here we are...
It is beautiful.
Do you have children?
Make any money?
Hey that sounds interesting.
That's how I make money.
About five miles back.
What was your last stop?
Stay right there...
Where did you stop last?
They must have picked it up in space.
Do you hear me George?
You're talking about taking a life.
I think we're better than that.
You'll be in the air with us.
That's the chance we have to take.
We'll do that.
He can change himself into a man.
Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I'm taking over.
What's all this for?
We'll make the policy.
All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
look this is just something to think about...
George listen to what you're saying.
This thing's changed itself into a man.
I'll make this as simple as I can George.
' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Earlier you were asking for help.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
It's too important.
Not necessarily bad!
I'll try and get you everything you need.
We'll need a lot of help George.
Get the body out of there.
They'll take it from there...
I saw it with my own eyes.
You're absolutely sure?
It's real George.
They're coming out.
You can speak to me Mrs.
If you want to ask me any questions call me at home in a couple of days.
I'm sorry what was your name again?
He let me go.
I'm on my way home.
Look I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Where are you Mrs.
Tell the baby about me.
What do I do now?
You are good.
How long will it take you to get home?
If you want to keep it you can.
This is yours...
I will say that we can be friends.
What will you say about us?
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible.
I will be asked a lot of questions.
This is very interesting.
We have other books.
But not a book like this.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
I want to get money for you and the baby.
You lose it.
You will have this baby.
If you want it.
But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know.
You said you wanted a baby so I gave you one.
They are beautiful.
I gave you a baby last night.
Oh you're pretty...
We talk to them.
Do they talk?!
How are you this morning?
I do not get cold.
You are cold.
We're too far away to walk.
You can stop.
There are no cars on this road.
We still have another day.
I feel better if I move.
I'll decide if I go or not.
We have to go another way.
You have to go back.
You can have one.
The machine gave me two.
Should I put one back?
On the radio they say it's good.
But I have never seen this before.
Put that back.
That was beautiful.
I'd really like to hear it.
I do not want to.
Do you have music up there?
Do you understand what they're saying?
I like this music.
Are you my friend?
What is hell?
He was a good friend...
A friend is a person that is good to you...
someone you like to be with...
Oh that's terrible.
Was he a good friend?
Just to look from up there.
We came and...
This was very important.
I was afraid.
Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Not every car but...
a car will stop...
Maybe not the first car...
maybe number eight number fifteen...
The car will stop?
You keep this.
Will you please do it my way?
I'll explain that in a minute.
But I must go here.
Forget the baby.
I'd love to have a baby.
Do you have a baby?
A baby is a new person?
Is that a baby?
When we get here.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
You can keep the car.
That should be enough for gas from here to there.
But he's dead.
Then let me go.
You'll keep the car.
I'll take a bus...
You'll keep...
That's not much time.
How will I do this one?...
When do you have to be here?
car will take me...
What is here?
I will see it next time.
That was a red light!!
I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I want to try it.
You want to try it?
Now get out.
He'll give us gas.
I am husband?
But that's the only place you could be from.
Are you from up there?
That's a big help.
What is for things.
For people you use who.
We need one that's open.
We need gas.
Which way do you want to go?
I'll give you whatever...
just walk away...
Oh God man...
let her go...
Call the police!!
I have nothing to do.
I'd like to help you.
I've got to get back there.
The five-fifty.
But it'll take him way out of his way.
They after you?
In the cars too?!
I told you I'm looking for someone.
You sure this is your car?
Tell him I'm not here.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them.
Is it for real?
Are you too stupid to see that?
Save us all a lot of trouble.
It was the husband.
Nothing up there...
It was a man though...
I tried it once...
Fourteen years ago...
The only thing I'm good at is this...
To the same woman?
Twenty-eight years.
There's nothing...
We better get it into the box.
This one's real.
It could have been anything.
Wait'll you see it.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Very beautiful country up here...
He died about three months ago.
I know what I saw.
I've seen him enough times.
Hold on a minute...
Let's take the chance George.
We'd like to talk to you.
Just not the eyes.
I already got a real one.
It's not personal.
Here's everything I have on me what do you say?
Come on let's go I got to get back.
But I could pay you more not to.
See what I mean?
I could write you a check right now--
I saw you play man.
You were good.
Just forget the thing is on.
what I'm putting on your head...
I live for the moment.
I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
And you keep talking to him.
Stand by your man"".
I was moved.
You were very good.
How'd you get up here?
I'd even do it for free.
Look baby it's now of never...
It's the only way we can be together.
You know it's true.
Come on quick.
I was trying to keep you out of this.
It's under my bed.
Come with me right now.
"" You always know when it's over.
It's over!
Now please leave.
I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
Yeah for about a month now.
And stay away from me.
Those days are over.
I'm a big girl now.
give up on me.
You have to get out of here.
It's you up on that stage not him.
That's a good one coming from you.
It'll take care of itself.
You're afraid of something.
Just answer one question.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
Make me forget it baby.
Forget it's there.
Is it on?
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Watch and see.
Talk to me about costs here.
I can get you what you want.
You just have to talk to me.
You say it you even think it you can have it.
You want a girl you want two girls?
you want a guy?
You want to be a girl...
What kind of things exactly?
Look I want you to know what we're talking about here.
This is life.
It's a piece of somebody's life.
You're there.
Just what I've read.
And now it's gone black market.
So what do you know about this?
Save us some time...
' And she says...
nothing means nothing.
So I say to myself if I turn the job down he just gets somebody else.
I figure it's him or me...
Was I a really busy guy?
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Shit being number one.
I sent her to the party.
I'll have that.
Stay on her.
Give him the tape.
It's fucking brilliant!
I know he'll go for it.
I can set it up.
And he's still working the party...
I say we work a trade.
All I'm saying...
I've heard stuff.
Is he dead?
Hey the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
But this is a bad one.
So've I.
while he's in her.
Wants to see it again.
Then he does her...
You used to be good at this stuff.
Play it down.
Let's work it.
I'm on her.
Watch her for me.
Do us both good.
You should feel like shit.
Hey it's just a job.
I feel like shit about it.
I'm telling ya it's over.
We used it all up--
It was funny.
But it cost me money.
She never gave me a tape.
Yeah she came by last night.
wait a minute.
Who was just here?
I mean she was just here.
What else you got?
That's for fucking sure.
I said that?
Bring me street life.
I always bring you choice.
Yeah well the first part's okay.
Look at it...
Yeah when did that start?
It's what people want to see and you know it.
It's policy.
The last part's the best.
Yeah but how'd it get to you?
How'd you get the tape?
I do mean it.
And I mean this...
He means it.
You'll make out.
I already got everything I need from you.
See you there.
They just have to ask us a few questions...
for about six hours.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
What if you're wrong?
Take it to him.
That's why it's a make- able deal.
and I've got what he wants...
And do what?
you're a girl.
But she was different.
There was a light in her eyes...
It's not about what's in her head.
It's what's in mine.
it's all I have left.
You never told me.
It's a set-up.
Save himself that way.
I know this guy.
The only card we have to play is the tape.
How long does it last?
There's a plus side?
Well look at the plus side.
But tonight is probably not the best night.
Maybe they ought to see.
I've got a good idea yeah.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Little life insurance.
But I'm asking you to do this.
It's that important.
You've got to see.
It's the walk.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
It's in my case.
Something in your car...
She wanted to go out to my car something about my car...
Think back about what she said.
Exactly what she said.
In my living room.
There's nobody back there.
We'll talk about it in the car.
I know you still love me.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.
It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Somebody wanted to shut her up.
She said ""If they get me"".
See it's all about what they see walking in.
She came to me for help.
I should have read it better...
I need to see more...
It gives me...
maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
So that gives you something.
Never really thought about it.
And gives it to you.
Are you sure it's real?
She said she needed my help and I...
What I'm saying.
You're some piece of work you know that.
that's football right?
Will that help?
It's on your way.
No you're just trying to get off.
Just trying to get by.
Well I'm out.
I'm just trying to hold on here.
I thought we were friends.
That would be no.
I need my case.
It's still in the back.
I've had enough of this shit.
Let's talk in the car.
Are we having a bad night?
You will not live to see the morning.
Coming with you.
Yeah but that was for love.
Just a couple of hours.
Well give me some then...
Did you meet a guy?
You really want that on your head?
Yeah well maybe it's time for a war!
It'll be all- out war and you know it.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
How do you like it now?
Oh one other thing.
Said I had very pretty feet.
He knew the guy's name.
he was older.
Was this him?
It went against everything we knew.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Anybody talk to the press?
You have the body?
Her body turned up.
They brought her back.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Show's over boys.
What does the Manager say?
Want to take a look?
No bad news.
Happens a lot around here.
You're thinking...?
I got something in the car to show you.
right across the state line.
Turn the body over.
The family has gone through a lot.
That's the thing.
Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in.
Should have cut it off.
Not as much as you'd think.
Oh yes I see.
You must get asked this a lot.
What do you want from me!?
You're a...
you're sick.
Tell me if you see anything you want.
You ever think of fucking other women?
You know you ever think about other women?
You ever think about you know...
About your being away all the time.
How does your wife feel about it?
I've seen you in here.
What's in the case?
He was sitting here?
What did he look like?
Just hospital talk.
At the field office.
We got box loads of evidence.
We have another one.
He's right!
We'll wait.
As far as the public knows Richard Low is dead.
I felt I needed to get away for a day.
You keep at it.
We'll find him we'll find him in our own way.
That's why I brought you back here.
Both in the last year.
How long ago?
I can imagine what he said.
"" It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
Nothing I'd...
They like the way I think.
I turn them on.
I always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special?
What were you doing?
He knew who I was of course.
He got away.
I had him.
I think I talked to him.
This better be important.
You have to save this boy.
It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Listen to this guy?
He'll never change.
When I was at the rest stop there was a young boy maybe ten and his mother.
I tried to stop him.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?
Miss me Dave?
Yeah of course.
A girl on Low's list.
I'd like you to come and look at it.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
It's too late for that.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
And you're working with him?
He found me.
I met with Richard Low.
Everybody says so.
You want to get him?
Find something he wants.
Get him to come to you.
There's been another one.
Everybody's looking for you.
It's not the other way around.
Not the way I can.
And nobody else can do that?
You need time to think.
About the case about you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
I had no right to speak to you like that.
I should have called.
He is very good.
This time they're waiting for you.
You found the body.
We did find these however.
Find the feet?
Not about this either.
He's called a couple times.
I've been thinking about this.
It's a no-no.
Of course he did.
Did he come on to you?
Did he hit on you?
Nobody knows this stuff better.
The girl in my story was fifteen years-old.
My parents took me home.
That's what I want to do.
I want to save her.
Take it to the next level.
What is he thinking?
What's this country coming to?
He thinks he looks young.
Does he really think he looks good?
or this one.
And one other thing.
They sort of came together.
This seems to be the best of both.
You got a point there.
This is some serious shit.
You want to have dinner?
The other reason?
I need to learn this stuff.
"" Come Tuesday twelve a.
Where's my watch?
So what do we have?
Why did he come out here?
I read your white paper.
I've got to watch what I say.
The boy's okay.
I saw him...
You went by the book?
Maybe you should back off.
Who told you about her?
Be my man.
You knew it was me all along?
And who else did I find?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Two hundred and eighty-five names.
Tell me what it says.
It was an opportunity to back off think things through.
Better to get rid of me.
Then he could be Mr.
I'm not sure exactly.
I saw it the first time I met him.
This is Richard Low.
Stay on the phone.
I'm watching you.
We want the same thing.
I want to go live with you.
[You tell me.
Did you know there was one?
[Not the heart the watch.
How's the watch?
Eight days from tonight exactly one a.
[Not this way.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.
He wants us to know he's out there what he's doing.
I talked to him.
Eight nine months ago.
I'd talked to him before.
It's the same guy.
Hope you never do.
It's all I care about.
This is a first.
Four hundred and sixty sir.
I see that.
That's why they're here.
What they got you doing?
What did you do to end up here?
It's over for you.
He had the best stuff.
He's a brilliant man.
You may know Low by another name.
You're money baby.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Stop come on.
I've got to use the phone.
You really should.
I'll think about that.
You has control over you're situation.
Ever since I've known you.
You've been through worse.
Well thank you...?
You better pay the man.
I'd say about two weeks.
Boy that must've been a while ago.
You asked me for an application?
and the money's really good.
I've seen you somewhere...
Where have I seen you?
Let me make it up to you.
What kind of car do you drive?
What do you drive?
Maybe that's not the case.
I mean no.
I can do that?
That's two more than me.
Tell me it gets better.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Well I left someone very special behind.
How was it hard?
You're not a real man?
Is that ""the money""?
then ask where you met her...
This place is dead anyway.
you might get cut out.
and even then...
not until you book it...
piece of shit.
I know what you're saying man.
He's in good hands.
Let me just check on my boy.
It's like you looked at my tape.
You saw my picture.
Why did you call me in?
You knew I was twenty-four.
So I check the time and place.
I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I'm sorry I never got your names...
Oh are we late?
I believe it too.
He really just wants her to be happy.
He really said that?
The poor thing.
I'll make some coffee.
And she's with someone else.
No matter what...
Can I get you something else?
I just wanted to order it.
Could you believe it?
Sure that'll be fine.
You're not allowed to hand me money sir.
On the table.
Sorry it's just that...
The phone's in the back.
You poor thing.
I know but she did.
She's with someone else now...
I'm sure she'll call.
Six years is a long time.
Actually it's funny you...
it's hard to explain...
Well I'm afraid it's not that easy...
I just wanted to ask you one thing.
It's just that it's tonight only...
Anyway I'm so bad at this if you're not busy I thought you might...
I would've called you back.
I can call back...
Yeah hold on.
Are you on the other line?
The red piece of shit over there...
I'm right across the street...
It's getting late.
It's really getting late.
Well I should be getting...
Not if you're serious about it.
Can I have one of these?
Do you have something to write on?
I had a great time.
I'll talk with you when you get back in town.
Listen can I call you right back?
I heard you might be moving back...
No he's not...
That's his name?
Do you know how hard it's been not to call you?
I pick up the phone every night.
I think about you every day.
I thought you met someone else.
You know us.
What kind of things?
I think about things.
It's been a while...
You always know the right thing to say.
for the same reason you miss her.
You lived with it so long.
You know how it is man.
I mean each day you think about it less and less.
How did you get over it?
She's got her own world to deal with in New York.
The future is so beautiful.
I mean we made it.
All that shit.
You'll get over it.
That's your problem man.
You are ""money"".
See it's all how you look at it.
I thought if you could make it maybe I could too...
They turned you down?
How am I doing well?
How good am I doing?
Well you're doing so well...
It's been two days.
You want to talk about it?
I had no idea...
You eat anything today?
Go for it man.
There are so many beautiful women here.
He's a nice guy though.
I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
What's that guy's name?
Well let's hit that party.
yeah a month ago.
Wait till summer.
It's like every day I see a beautiful woman.
I'm not used to that.
The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there.
You have to have someone come before.
It's one of these.
What'd you get?
I'll give you an eight.
Eight or Nine.
What do you have?
You want to hit the town tonight?
I've decided to get out there.
Play it out.
Good for you man.
Well until now.
Send more money.
I mean I need the money.
It's just that you've been there.
Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Ah see that's the thing.
Unless she comes back first.
Wait what do you mean?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back.
You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
So what's the difference?
Believe me I know what that's like.
Yo Double Down!
We're better friends for it.
But most important man I'm sorry about what I said.
That boy can talk.
What are they doing here?
I'm so sorry man.
You were so right.
Hey man you're not from here.
Give me the money.
You should play another team.
Did you just walk in or were you listening all along?
I think you're great but maybe we should just take some time off from each other.
It's not you really.
It's only been six months...
Could you just call me when you get in?
I just wanted to leave my number.
I mean you know we should just hang out.
Just you know hang out.
Anyway my number is...
So call me tomorrow or like in two days whatever.
Are you ready to order?
There you two are.
He's got it under control...
I got it under control.
I mean it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
It's not like that...
So two days?
How long do I wait to call?
You're not just like fucking with me?
What'd I do wrong?
Was I money?
You looked right at her baby.
It's on.
It looked money.
through the kitchen...
You met him once.
It starts at eight...
What time's this party tonight?
He got away?
That was the best part of the old game.
Baby she's the one who should be thinking about you.
And what does this guy she's with do?
It's work.
You're doing what you love.
Now look at you.
Look how far you've come in just a few months.
You've come so far.
Remember the first week?
After she told you?
I just need some time...
But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad.
It's no good man.
It was college.
That was different.
Baby you take yourself out of the game.
Yeah a good friend.
I heard them talking.
They both thought you were money.
She thought you were money.
You're money.
She was hot.
I just wanted you to have a good time.
She asked me what I was thinking about?
What should I have done?
I have to use the phone.
Baby you'll check them tomorrow.
I need to use the phone.
So what'd you say to him?
Then he says it's just that I'm a little old.
I'm like ""How old is the Brother?
So I go in.
""Big Brother"" ""Little Brother""?
""I love you...
The role is Brother.
What was the part?
Baby we're money.
It's just down the hall.
we'll be fine.
You did fine.
Baby you did fine.
It went over her head.
They know what you want believe me.
That's what I'm telling you baby.
They know what you want.
You think I give a shit?
It's hard I know.
Not for six years but I know.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long.
It's time to move on.
We'll both get one.
Baby this is what we came for.
Baby did you hear her?
"" She wants to party baby.
You think she's coming back?
That was money.
Baby you're money.
Let's just leave.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I should be sorry.
You know exactly how much you lost.
Thirty Forty maybe.
Hey man I'm down too you know.
But I lost!
How can you say always?!?
I'm just saying not in this particular case.
Well obviously not always!
I'm telling you baby you always double down on an eleven.
Double down baby.
Oh they're watching all right.
They're watching.
You think they're watching?
Well you look money baby.
We both look money.
Who's fucking around?
Let's do it baby.
I'm telling you they love that shit.
That's New York baby.
This place is dead.
Look at it baby.
This is how you do it.
Just bring your card.
Shut up -- yes you are.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
You got it bad baby.
I got shit to do tomorrow...
Wait three days...
it is so on.
It is on.
it's definitely on.
it's on.
It's on...
Things are different here.
What'd you want me to do?
I used to wait two days.
Tomorrow then a day.
you're money...
we're not...
That's what I keep trying to tell him.
Baby I know it is.
What was cold about it?
Yes she did.
She's not looking at you.
Will you stop asking if...
Wait she just looked.
Is she looking now?
Is she looking at me baby?
Oh it's on baby...
against the computer.
I'll be back with the coffee.
What time are you off...
One fifty-nine Two minutes.
Yes I understand I'm listening.
I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
What do you wish me to do?
Be my friend.
You think it's enough to be an American.
How much shall I pay you.
You ask for too much.
What do you want of me?
I'll give you anything you want but do what I ask!
Go back to your house and wait for me...
I'll come to you when I need you.
I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Like hell I will.
Eat it it's on the table.
The food is on the table.
Your girl friend.
Pick him up yourself and bring him to my father's house.
Maybe three four times.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
he was home.
You heard about your father?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now this minute.
But it's alright.
These things have to happen once every ten years or so...
How bad will it be?
You think we'll go for that last place?
Good for ten men...
see everything is okay.
how a man makes his living is none of my business.
Why do you come to me?
I want you to eat well to rest.
And spend time with your family.
You take care of your family?
Can I do something for you still?
Now you've had your drink.
But you needed a drink first.
No give him a living.
But never let him know the family's business.
leave right after that.
Your new son-in-law do we give him something important?
It's been two years.
He's probably in trouble again.
Let the people enjoy him.
Should I bring him in.
On a day like this.
Write that down before you forget it.
When did he call?
You understand him better than anyone.
Is it necessary?
Your wife and children...
you're happy with them?
I think you have done the same with this man.
I'll need him.
How did you find out?
What else do you believe in?
Then why have I become a man like you?
You wanted me to be your son.
No I wanted other things for you.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it but that I never had a choice.
Accept what's happened Michael.
I want children I want a family.
I understand Michael.
But you must make a family you know.
Have you thought about a wife?
When you are finished come and talk to me.
What was this for?
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
An Act of Congress!
You want him to stay in this country.
You must go right away.
but Michael use this car.
I should see this place.
There is nothing there.
Michael why must you do this.
She'll join me in a few weeks...
Is your wife coming with you?
Get the car.
Hey beautiful girls!
You take me I'll be the best man you got.
Beautiful all over eh?
I know about what you mean!
I'm running the Family business now.
So anything you have to say say it to me.
Get rid of them...
Give them some money and send them home.
That's for you to find out.
Who are those girls?
The party starting!
Ever seen anything like that before?
You look good too.
That doctor did some job on your face.
Well it's war!
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.
Anyone know it.
You just help me win.
This is not a personal thing this is Business.
If not it's all out war.
We should hear what they have to say.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
He always goes home when he's through.
What about the hit list.
he's got a problem.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Will you give this to him.
Nobody knows where he is.
We know he's all right but that's all.
You should call...
then you can go...
I'll try...
Now he's dead nothing can bring him back.
it's good business.
And I'll tell you why.
But he should try me again on anything else.
A week from tonight.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
I know now.
How will they come at you?
I needed another four months and I would have had them all.
I really needed him.
They get a little more money than the job's worth.
What could be more important than that.
Anything I can do for you.
He's been asking for you.
Michael it's not true.
Let HER ask.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
No you eat...
When will I see you again?
think things over.
I'm sure most of it's not true.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Please say it.
Tell me you love me.
Can you say it?
I LOVE YOU.
How is your father?
I'm thinking about it.
Michael what are you doing?
Then we can have dinner see a show and spend one more night.
What time do they expect us?
What will your father say?
And what do you want for Christmas?
If he's your brother why does he have a different name?
He's coming over here!
Michael I love you.
You really want to know?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
They're talking to themselves.
They're waiting to see my father.
Michael what are those men doing?
I've never seen anything like it.
Believe me and help me.
to another room on another floor...
You just stand here one minute...
The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.
I look in on him.
Probably a year...
How long do you think before I can come back?
A million times.
Set up the meeting for two days from now.
I came down late.
Also I got other things.
To the city.
Is it like they say?
Is he that good?
I know I'm not the man he was.
But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.
We got people in the phone company.
I can help you out...
She's been through it before.
You were too young to know about it.
I've missed my chance.
Just keep an open mind when we talk.
All this is terrible it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all.
It should never have happened.
And all his works?
He talked to you?
The two  go hand in hand.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.
Think of your price.
This is for business; name your price.
Maybe we can do better.
I buy you out.
Buy me out?...
Got everything you want?
Find out anything you can...
I'll try to find out more.
and especially you of course...
and that's only the boys.
Alright bar's open.
Oh it was.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
It's not love it's the coffee machine.
No I like him.
You'd say if you mind?
It'll just be for a little while.
He can be...
It's great.
Did you speak to my father?
I'll come down.
Did you forget where I live?
Sorry sorry sorry.
And be careful in the sun.
I'm absolutely honest with you.
I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
I thought I might come back.
In the New Year.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
If you knew my life back home in New York...
I'm always planning.
It's time we all moved on.
Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North.
But it would be great though if you came with me.
I thought you might write again.
You've been so good to me.
You're the brother I never had.
I'm the brother you never had.
Do you know what that means in a place like this?
Why are you asking me?
I thought you'd missed the train.
The most important question is where to eat.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
You must be sick of the same clothes.
I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Okay you get in.
Can I get in?
All only children -- what does that mean?
Well we certainly know that's true.
I write like a child.
How do I look.
She can do that stuff for you.
Thank you Dad.
A few places -- that's a few jobs.
That's one job you told me a lot of jobs.
What were you actually doing in New York?
That's the next thing to deal with.
Have you ever known such low class?
You're doing really well.
Your parents met her.
This is so good of you.
You're upstairs at the back.
Do you always type your letters?
This is the best.
It's got nothing to do with my mother!
HE wants me back!
-- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I'd pay you.
You've got to hear this!
I met him in New York.
I feel like he's here.
That's brilliant!
How do you know him?
It's too much!
That's three.
No still here.
You're so white.
Well I knew you so I suppose you must have known me.
And did we know each other?
There's this great new club.
Listen just take one of mine when we get back.
Hey if I'm late think what her husband's saying!
I think I'm saying it.
Have you done something to your hair?
You should watch that!
Are you living here?
How did you find him?
Have you heard him play that thing?
What about Christmas?
He's gone to dinner!
If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you.
Yes I'm good thank you.
Do you know it?
Let me in.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
You've been a great friend to my son.
Somebody's got to -- what's the word?
I'll try my best sir.
I'm well thank you.
You look well.
Now you can go for a reason.
I've always wanted to go to Europe sir but...
Thanks yes I think we did.
I'm sure we've met.
I hope she never knows.
He really does.
We hope she never knows.
I could probably see my bedroom from here.
I can see my house.
I know it was you.
He gave them to me.
So many things.
Or I do.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
He's having an early night.
Look at me what?
He's American.
I'm sure of that.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Hello Peter so good to see you.
I'll take you to him.
There was an argument.
Are you getting on?
I tried again waiting here watching for him.
He was there with someone.
Is he really not here?
Did he say why?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
He's not even aware of it.
Perhaps you can help me?
I bought it for him for his birthday.
That ring's so great.
The green one.
Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
He's not a man he's a god.
I never said that!
You're off?
There are no lines there's some problem.
He told me everything.
I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago so I...
How would you know that?
He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
And now look at you.
What's funny?
Who's paying for this?
Is this you?
He's not coming till the morning.
I think we sort of found each other.
So you found Peter...
We think he's had a change of heart.
No we're meeting another friend.
I bet you are.
You know what -- I am.
Which is why the get-up.
I've thought about you.
Oh God I've thought about you so much.
Of course I'll meet you.
Will you meet me tomorrow?
So it's not just this it's too...
No I absolutely understand.
I'll take them both.
Show me the other one again.
I like them both.
As in the...?
My father wants me in New York.
I thought I saw you there.
Trying not to be.
Where have you been since then?
Could take some time!...
Just tell me some nice things.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody!
That's the last thing you are.
I'm lost too.
Sorry I'm completely lost.
She thought she'd seen you.
Come back though.
What are you up to?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
You try talking to her.
Or I could come back.
Do you want me to stick around?
starting with myself...
the thing is Peter if...
In my case it's probably a whole building.
I knew that one.
I was sure that was the --
Not the best way to spend your first day.
Peter I'm really sorry to put you through this.
Have you been waiting long?
It's really good to meet you.
Tomorrow's possible.
Will we see you later?
Yes what happened?
Yes -- you're right.
You have yes.
I think I just said.
May I ask...
Let her in what's the difference?
Let her in.
No actually no I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Does he stay with you here?
A few days ago.
That was months ago.
Can we go up?
I went to bed.
Who found him?
They'd never get me to go back.
You got anything to carry these in?
It's hell out there all right.
I was all around.
One hospital then the next.
Sure here take this card go to this place and give 'em the card.
Well you're talking big money now.
How much for everything.
I want a.
You got a.
No no please.
Oh I got over that.
It was nothing really.
That'll go away.
What about the record?
You go your way I'll go mine.
There's plenty...
This is sort of high class...
I've seen them.
I'd like to though.
I live on music.
He'll what else can I do with it all?
Who was that again?
Eighty miles a day a hundred miles a night.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Six to six sometimes eight.
Seventy-two hours a week.
What hours do you work?
They got to talking.
They do more or less the same things every day.
That's the law.
Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Now I remember!
Three in the morning?
I have to go to bed early.
I work days.
It must have been somebody else.
Late one night.
I could have picked you up.
It's not that bad.
That's really something.
They took him.
Just people people you know.
Had a dead man once.
What kind of people?
I can believe that.
I've got the same problems.
Little things I mean.
Nothing can happen.
She needs a friend.
Well then what is it you exactly want to do?
Well we're all working tonight.
Oh I think he's a wonderful man.
Make a great great President.
That's someone else.
Show me how he did that again.
With the other hand right?
I just wanted to see if you could light it that way.
Oh are you all right?
How long has he been there?
The one that's been sitting here.
Sure we could run him.
That's the last.
Some people can learn.
And you wonder why we never get serious --
It's all the same news.
Same order usually.
What you thought they had good news for people right?
Not the news not the issues the man.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while you'd get somewhere.
More people watch it.
Should we wait for that?
No no it's alright.
That what you want?
No I'm serious really...
That's the guy.
Support my kids.
I never use mine.
But it's a good thing to have.
Look who's talking?
And what happened?
You said that?
Draw you a picture?
Could you see anything?
First she did her make-up.
You know I hate it when they do that.
You carry a piece?
You need one?
Just heard it on the radio.
My work may take me out of New York.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?
You may not see me again -- for a while.
I'll give you the money to go.
Otherwise I would.
I think you should go home but otherwise I think you should go.
It would be great for you.
You have to get away from here.
And they hate it.
So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all.
You're not much with girls are you?
Just should though.
Nobody'd miss 'em.
You should get rid of them.
Just leave'em.
There's plenty of other girls.
What's so important?
I've got something important to do.
I could never go to a place like that.
I can tell you that.
That's why we get along so well.
It's hell.
Girls should live at home.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents?
They hate me.
Where is home?
It's a date.
I'll see you here then.
Well you want to or not?
I got a...
No I mean really.
This is nothing for a person to do.
That's not hard to do.
Can I see you again?
It means something really.
Well I tried.
That's why they stopped me.
But that one night?
Do you understand why I came here?
Oh come off it man.
But you're the one that wanted to get away.
Why should I want to get out of here?
You want to make it like this?
I came here to get you out.
How do you want to make it?
You tried to get away one night.
It's easy to remember.
You see that guy over there?
Go talk to him.
You looking for some action?
Pull over right here.
Have you tried the telephone?
You're a good man sir.
There must be something...
I'm sure you'll win sir.
Well then check back tomorrow.
I tried that.
I got it all.
We'll send you all the stuff all right.
There used to be one standing over there.
Show it to me.
You know anybody by that name?
How are things?
I want some action.
Anything you say officer.
Here officer take me in.
You'll be all right.
I seen enough to know.
You fit in.
But you fit in.
You got no choice.
Look a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it.
What do you know?
You live it.
You see that must be what I am.
Like do anything you know.
Things got ya down?
Well I just you know...
I wanted to ask you something on account you've been around so long.
Look ah we never talked much you and me...
What's the action around?
Shit shit shit what time is it.
do no stop.
Six years Bill.
We've lived together six years.
You think I'm too...
Now there's some good news.
That record company.
Could we change the subject?
You know how I feel about what you do.
Had a close one.
Just come and get me sir.
Get him back!
It's me sir.
All this time?
Man asking me for a break.
So cut me a break.
It's all I could think of.
Where is he sir?
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
HE'S ON THE= PHONE.
You'll be outside.
Well yes I suppose...
Tell me what you really do.
And I love you!
What's the second thing?
Just remember two things.
First the law is a living thing.
Sometimes it takes a while.
thanks thank you.
I'll take good care of this.
Believe it or not I've read this since high school and it got me all the way through law school.
Did you bring along something to read?
I wish you were coming with me.
You've got everything?
You'll stand by me?
I am too.
Forget about all that.
You want to do the right thing?
I know the law and the law's on your side.
But if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care?
Thanks I like it.
It's a nice name.
want a piece of me.
I had it a minute ago...
it's the...
I'll be right down.
You mean  me?
I'm sure it'll all come back to him.
You're sure he's  okay?
That always used to work.
I think  it's worse  now.
That's my girl!
Not as bad as I thought it would.
And I'm not...
It started coming back a couple of days ago.
I remember everything now.
do you remember?
It never used to be.
Now did you remember that or...
And he got good.
That was nice of me.
You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him.
You tried to once.
Well there's got to be a way...
You could go to the bank...?
We've done this before so many times.
Do you feel it?
and It's just...
I'm  fine.
Do you have the...
We were in love...
No you are.
It's that the other person gives something to you...
that you had all the time.
I'm not making sense am I?
For four years.
And we were on the debate team together.
And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
what did I want to be?
Or better in fact.
It ought to be where people can see it.
"" And all the others.
I knew them all.
We went to school with most of them.
You have to help me down.
You must not remember anything.
where can we go?
You can all go home now.
And you've lost weight.
I've seen you before.
Well then as what did you go?
That was what you knew then.
What do you know now?
Well that's what I knew then.
Or who I knew I should say.
We see it.
""  What's the point of this?
Start with what you knew then.
They're two different things?
yes I do.
that was something that just happened.
We never met.
But I'd like to think I know him.
Sir that is true.
I need a drink of water.
I'll do my best Mr.
Well son you're home!
Only one in town.
Get in son.
The young man in there...
That's your father!
Are you saying that he's...
Boy you say you have no idea who you are?
I remember the picture...
""It's a Wonderful Life?
I remember that one.
""It's a Wonderful Life.
You think it over.
I'll come to the point.
I just want the land.
I can only imagine.
Place needs a lot of work.
Good to meet you.
Oh God I love you son.
Anybody take it?
Everyone went home.
Did I what?
I thought we'd get an early start.
what time is it?
You know since you've been back that's the first time you've called me ""Dad.
Oh no I...
Friend of yours from high school.
You've got to remember that.
You've got to.
The war had just started...
you were gone less than a month...
Did I ever keep the books here?
And you'll get one too.
Well yes that she was.
She certainly made this place a home.
But now that you're back well things will be different around here that's for sure.
Nine and-a-half years...
Nine and-a-half years ago.
nineteen forty-two.
When did I leave?
You never came back from the war.
what's my name again?
I'll save you the trouble.
Did it myself.
Everyone's someone else.
Sure I suppose.
You should watch what you say.
You think maybe you've had enough?
That's where you live.
Wish I could say the same thing.
She's very pretty.
It's okay son.
We just need to call you something.
Here one of mine.
Any idea how you got here son?
Can we get him to the hospital?
it seems as though his body is just...
there's a word for it...
Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Thirty a month.
Hey it's the best way to tell.
He must not be dead in here.
They already knew about her.
Oh god oh god no I...
she was a girl I knew in college...
Well that's not what they think.
Her name was right there in front of them.
The more names the better.
That's what I do.
No of course not why should you be sorry?
I'm not sorry for what I said.
That was quite a show you gave them today.
The time after that it might be the President.
But it'll always be someone.
Now if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear they'll clear you.
"" I think it's great.
Peter I believe in you.
Yeah well that's enough.
I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!
You were coming out of a bar.
They know you were at that meeting Peter.
They've been told and they know.
So you're saying that it's true.
Maybe I did.
I was in college.
Who the hell is this ""they?
They say you did.
Some of it might come back to you.
Play with me.
Oh dear yes.
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I forget things sometimes.
We thought you was dead, you know.
It's okay that I live here?
That's simple.
I thought you...
It's Peter.
He died in the war.
He's not coming back and I'm not him.
It's about me.
They'll come back you know.
I'll have to think about this.
I have to get back...
I should go...
But I'm not you know that.
You mean he was...
let go too?
He was but he got sick.
That you got let go.
What exactly did you hear?
Well morning's half-over.
Got any money?
Lost both his boys in the war.
And I know all them.
They all know you?
If she still is...
Oh the poor thing.
Is anyone there?
That's up to you.
Do you think I should go?
This has been a busy day.
I said I would.
It was over and I knew it but I wanted to be near him anyway.
You see I still like him a hell of a lot.
And the second?
Then you know.
Here I have a life.
'  And I'll give them what I have.
To me that's very important.
That's the first reason.
I came up here for two reasons.
well you know you probably went to one yourself.
but we both knew it was finished.
I can understand his position.
Then what was it?
So what was the answer?
And what had you done?
Four years ago.
Things may be different now.
I think I'll have some of that too.
It's over and done with.
How'd you happen to come here?
It takes a while to get used to.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
If you have some I'd...
Is that cut beginning to bother you?
You can have it.
Where's your bag?
In the car?
Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Did you find her all right?
No I'm an open book I'm afraid.
It's a nice drive.
Actually it's none of my business.
something like that.
Just a few hours.
It's a lovely garden.
The man at the post office sent me.
I'm sorry to bother you but...
If your father were here...
Just listen to them!
Six times can you imagine it?
Your brother's practice...
He sold Mr.
Darling of course I do!
I'll be eleven tomorrow you know.
Just a little one.
Oh I suppose so.
Your brother told me.
Well I suppose...
They're beautiful!
They're just what I wanted!
Is there a man and a woman?
do you think they'll be all right?
Is she all right?
I wish I could say.
Why are they doing this?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Could save yourself a lot of trouble.
You head for the school.
That case I tell you what you do.
Now you take a right turn there you got that?
The little girl's name.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Where would I get a boat?
If that's what you wanted to do.
That's the road.
The front door.
How do I get down there?
The two kids?
And the white house?
Yes but where?
Try my best.
I wonder if you could help me.
What good'll that do?
Why not Mrs.
They're back!
She was in a boat.
You cut yourself outside Miss?
You want to sit up here?
Shall I call the doctor?
Here's fine.
You want it at the table?
They could have been after the fish just as you said.
You want more coffee?
Who said anything about war?
I started to say...
What do we have to know Mother?
We're all together we all love each other we all need each other.
What else is there?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
If they are?
If they're already there?
We have to try it.
We'd never make it.
They're probably all over the road.
There's no place to go.
But they'll be back.
I know you can.
But I'd like to.
Oh my God look at her!
I'm trying my best!
When will you know?
When we're all dead?
Where will we go?
We'll see what...
Maybe we ought to leave.
That's a chance we have to take.
If there are...
they'll get into the house.
When do you think they'll come?
I got them all Mother.
Tell him about the party.
well is everyone all right?
I know exactly what I want Mother.
It's none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to...
I know Mother.
Mother where did you go to law school?
We met yesterday.
And certainly pretty.
Never mind the law.
By the way where is she?
Mother I'd like you to meet...
I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?
Did you close the door?
That's the last of it.
I'd feel so much better.
Would you like me to go for her?
Do you think she's all right?
That's the mark of a man.
You see I...
My son is important to me.
Is that so important Mrs.
I'm not quite sure how I feel about it.
like you or not.
I feel as if I...
And I want so much to understand.
Would you like to rest now Mrs.
I miss him.
I get up and there's a...
a very good reason for getting out of bed until...
until of course I remember.
I miss talking to him.
I wish I could be that way.
I'm not this way you know.
You see he knew the children he really knew them.
I lost my husband four years ago you know.
Try not to think of that Mrs.
Yes I'm sure she's fine.
At the school.
What good will they do?
He must have.
Then he saw.
No it's me Mrs.
I thought you might like some tea.
We'll be all right.
Does this room look silly?
How old is she now?
They came in!
Do about what?
About sixty miles north of here.
He goes up there every weekend.
Well where did he go?
He's not home.
If we get through town I think we'll be all right.
Can we turn back?
Almost two a.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
When will they stop?
Have we still got power?
I tried a little while ago.
The phone's dead.
Do you want to try your father again?
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
This could be last week.
The past fifteen minutes.
The town looks clear.
I was just taking her in some tea.
Will you be all right here?
everything I know.
It makes you feel as if they're...
they're waiting or...
It was like that yesterday.
This was a bad summer.
What it was probably...
"" they asked themselves.
Well they'll go along with anything.
Not at first.
So they united.
' he kept saying over and over...
It's so beautiful and still now.
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back.
I'd feel a lot better.
No I have my things in the car.
what's happening?
No tell me.
What'll it say?
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
What do you do then?
things like that.
That's not a job of course.
I do different things on different days.
I have several jobs.
You have a job?
I have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing.
What's in this?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner.
I thought you knew!
But not for me.
It is for me.
But it's not good enough now.
I'd still like to see you.
Do you expect me to believe...?
It said ""Dear Mr.
"" That's what it said.
I wrote the letter.
Did you really write a letter to me?
With all my clothes on!
Anything they said...
Without any clothes on?
We might get along very...
How does Mother know what I like to do?
With a lot of time on my hands.
I'd like to see you.
Will I be seeing you again?
He was watching a ball game on television.
Dinner's just about ready.
Something seems to be wrong with them.
You're sure now?
I'll have to see.
Of course how stupid of me.
A quarter to seven will that be all right?
What time is dinner Mother?
Right next to the one you already had.
But you were coming up anyway remember?
I come all the way up here to...
It was no trouble at all.
I simply called my father's paper.
But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was and where I lived and...
Why would I want to see you of all people?
I think you came up to see me.
Here let me put this on.
Just a few...
just a day or two...
we went to school together.
Well well small world.
To see a friend of mine.
Will you please be careful?
You said it was her birthday.
What kind of law?
Do you practice here?
What made it...
I'll find something else.
See you in court some day.
I saw you in court.
We met in court.
how do you know my name?
Some of them are.
I imagine that's very important.
Yes we call them that too.
No sir those are...
I think so sir.
Now then let me see.
I understand completely sir.
These are for my sister...
her birthday you see.
As she'll be eleven and...
yes sir there are.
Yes what was it you were looking for sir?
I said I wonder if you could help me.
That would be just fine.
No this is a small one.
No I'll stop up there in a little while.
Is daddy in his office?
Just tell him I'll see him later.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning.
Would that be all right?
well how soon would you want them?
No not in the shop.
But I can order them for you.
No you'd better send him.
May I use your phone?
If you'd care to come back...
who was that?
There we are!
Well all right but...
I'm sure they're on the way though.
Could I just call?
Oh well all right.
Oh my I suppose I should call them again.
Maybe it's the traffic.
Would you mind waiting?
Well yes he'll talk.
Well no no.
And he'll talk?
Oh you have no idea.
What do you suppose it is?
No one called it a war!
I think they were after the children.
What do you think they were after Miss...?
Yes all right I'll wait for you.
Yes I'll wait.
They're different Daddy.
Well all right but you act as if I'm...
all right all right.
How is it there?
But no trouble.
Well I hope...
Tell Mother not to worry.
All right Daddy good-by.
There is very definitely a difference Miss.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
How do you plan to do that?
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
I'm not sure but...
You're an important man in this town.
If you'll help the rest will.
If I thought...
I think we're in trouble.
They were gone the next morning just as if nothing at all had happened.
We're better off without them.
Get rid of them.
Not if they're starting a war.
We need them.
Who needs them?
Of course it does.
Makes a lot more sense than...
Take it easy lady.
Then let's go.
You can follow me.
Maybe He knows best.
I want you to help my little girl.
I can be there in an hour.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it.
Please -- tell me where he is.
Your news will keep until I tell him.
Where can I find him?
But that's long since.
If he were only that.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
You must leave this house.
It was a woman when we put her in.
This is not a woman!
No room there.
We'll have to set it between us.
Where shall we put it?
In the back?
It's the only way you can learn.
They'll be thinking of that too.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What's that you say?
I'll have no more to do with it.
Child I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
But she must want to stand.
She must want to walk.
I know it's all right.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
I've just been to see Mrs.
Wait Doctor -- wait!
Who would believe that?
I am sure.
I mean to report it.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs.
You see it is completely out of the question.
But I -- well you see sir I met Mrs.
So she told me.
She came again today.
And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor you'll see it as I see it.
But this woman -- and her son --
Come along now --
I'm afraid I have to sir.
You're made for a doctor young man!
Take a look at the child.
But Doctor I only wanted to speak to you --
Come in boy -- come in.
I wanted to see the white horse --
I left last night.
I thought this was a school day.
You have to walk and run to find him.
Do you want it that much?
I want it --
Aye but I still wonder how much.
You want to walk and run and play.
I try to make myself used to it.
Maybe there's another reason.
He was a nice horse.
The white horse.
You'll be a good doctor.
Are you a doctor too?
He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
We have never been friends.
Have I not told you --
Why should I be afraid of you?
I am a doctor - a good doctor.
But what makes a thought start?
I am a doctor.
It's only the dead ones that you know.
I know the body.
I know how it works.
I've had some experience.
More like the old days.
Well come in.
It might be an interesting case.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.
Say that you'll do it for me and my friend Mr.
Oh yes you will.
I am the best man for the job.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Afraid of what?
You're a teacher eh?
You will not have it?
I will not have you use that name to me.
That'll keep.
Sit down here with me.
But when he had them there then what?
But where did they get those people?
But what did they do?
You and I should work together.
You say you've come here on your own account?
No one knows you are here?
Can anyone hear what we say?
That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
What did you hear?
I saw something.
I can do nothing for her.
She would if she could.
But she must be able to move.
Everything is in place.
I'm sorry Doctor.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But Doctor surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But can anything be done for her?
Nearly a year.
You can get out.
No great lady will ever take my place?
Was that it?
But when she did you lost it.
You think the world did you wrong?!
You did the world wrong.
You sent them.
I'm looking for my friends.
around or whatever the hell you're doing here.
I hate that picture.
Call the police?
I think we should get some support?
We're getting there.
I sure will.
Two to go.
we'll get him.
And I'll be seeing her again soon.
Only what will I say?
This is not just some ""thing.
Keep that thing away from me.
Twelve an hour.
What did they give you?
Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head ""yes.
You said you saw me with this.
I never held it until today.
I said what I saw.
A guy and a girl.
Good thing in a situation like this.
You're him!
You're dead man!
That's not how we play the game.
I was talking about you.
You're him.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Which of you has it?
Why's anything happen?
It's all money man.
The girl just got in the way.
I want my life back.
to know why.
What you fucking want?
I heard you were looking for this.
I'll always be with you.
My big deal daddy.
Have to find him first.
Left me with nothing.
Here's where it happened.
Yes I do I really do.
I wish I were dead.
is that I sent them here.
I told them she came here sometimes.
That's exactly what I said.
They said they were looking for her right?
This is where it happened.
Right over here.
And you need...
to be careful.
My dad was right!
But what you're doing now does.
And another one.
Took a wrong turn.
I told you I knew your sister.
Stay away from me!
I know everything about your sister.
Someone else did it.
And he's right over there by the way.
What did you do to your face?
Your father gave them to both of you.
You have one just like it.
I know her friends.
I was a friend of your sister's.
Maybe we had a case of that here.
He's looking for something.
Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Could say that.
You do know something.
Yeah we do.
I know how her mind worked.
She was eighteen years old!
There were four of them.
Where is it?!
I want you...
You want me to walk a straight line?
But you you've had them.
What's with your friend there?
Let's hope not.
It's not what you think.
You're in with them.
Looks like you have them both on.
No one knew but us.
He was right here.
now that he's gone I think it's time.
I know you think she's been talking to you.
Stay in the car.
I'll only take a second.
She'd want it.
Just hold on to me.
Why are there so many?
Yes sir -- it certainly does!
Did you speak to our friend Mr.
I talked to most of them this morning...
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight?
What a brilliant idea.
I never would have thought of it.
The whole city has stopped.
You should go out and see it for yourself!
It's quite an interesting problem.
Would day after tomorrow be all right?
I'll think of something.
Yes -- of course.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this.
One thing Mr.
I leave that in your hands.
We must get important men from every field.
That's what I came to see you about.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned.
Would you care to be more specific?
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
Yes -- that is true.
That was my first question.
Sit down please.
I have several thousand questions to ask you.
But what about the effect of the other terms?
That's why I wanted to see you.
You wrote this?
He gave these to you?
You just thought you did.
Yes I have!
Now think back hard.
I had to tell you!
What are you doing up at this hour?
No dear of course not.
He's a very nice man.
Now you get to bed and forget about it.
What do you mean dear?
Sure we did!
Did you and Mr.
He's my best friend...
Go to bed darling.
You can finish that in the morning.
Of course dear.
Did you have a nice day dear?
I think it's time you went to bed.
Can I help you look for the space man?
I know what he looks like!
Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Why -- the light in my room went out.
What do you want it for Mr.
We'll finish it tomorrow...
We certainly did.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this Mr.
Well sure but--
Some places that's what people use for money.
Do you think they'd accept these?
I've got some money.
But not like this one...
Is it different where you've been?
Very far away.
No -- I'm afraid not.
And he'll never get it that way.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
You think they'll ever find him?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour.
Yes -- I think so.
It's for a lot of other things too.
What do you think makes it go?
Boy I'll bet he's strong.
She's a secretary.
My mother's a real secretary.
Right near where my mother works.
I was speaking of earth men.
He was very nice about it.
How does he explain that?
He's seventy-eight.
Oh I'd say forty-five.
How old do you think he is?
I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
It's not your government I'm thinking about.
I tried to make you understand.
Not very good news I'm afraid.
""  Well -- there you have it.
Have you any news?
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I am not concerned Mr.
I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Surely you would agree--
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
This is not a personal matter Mr.
Would you care to talk about it?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
The present situation?
I'm afraid in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
You must have come a long way.
About five months -- your months.
Sit down Mr.
We all feel--
You wait and see.
I feel different right now.
The rest of the world is involved!
Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Is that what you're thinking about?
He told you...
You realize what this'd mean for us?
He told me what he came here for.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Of course it's important.
The point is we can do something about it.
After what happened today?
Never mind about that.
I know it's true.
Why is it nobody knows anything about him?
Can I talk to you later?.
Yes that'll be fine.
I thought we might have lunch together.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I wonder if we ought to--
Looks real to me.
Is it real?
But look what I found in his room
After all what do you know about him?
I hope Mr.
I was talking to Mr.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I will be in just a minute.
I just want to think it over.
It was a wonderful day.
Well we could--
We're all set.
I think I'm very lucky.
That's all finished.
How long will I live?
That no one can say.
But how -- how long--?
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I -- I thought you were--
Remember those words.
I mean -- without you what could he do?
I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
No wait a minute -- there's someone else.
He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Yes -- Just exactly.
It must be twelve-thirty.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
Before I ask you to be honest with me perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
Did you believe what he told you?
I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
I want to know what he told you last night.
May I walk out with you?
May I see you for a minute?
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions.
He's a fine boy Mrs.
Everyone seems so--
You might keep this.
Well he's not here.
I think you'd better leave now.
And what do you want?
I'd give you a very good price.
No -- no thanks.
Would you like to sell it?
You sure about that?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
Will you please tell me where it came from?
Is it worth anything?
They can tell right away.
How long will that take?
Well how do I know who you are?
It's really quite simple...
The three- body problem you know.
But I suppose you know the answer.
We lost it!
This one could save your life.
Those two we brought back with us.
Two down and two to go.
That's just the way we like it.
They're looking at us.
I've only got one question for you and I want an honest answer.
Should I run him through?
What is this David?
Hey take it easy.
I'm my own man.
Just try to keep up.
Put it down.
I will David!
You're almost one of us now Michael.
I want to go.
And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
That's exactly what this place is.
Hit the lights again.
How do you know they're not?
Now I get it...
This is just our cover.
I'll take you there.
I'll take mine to go.
You men we're having company again?
When do we eat?
We've all been through enough.
Thanks for having us Dad.
She said not to be late.
Did we have a date tonight?
That's about as close to town as I like to get.
for about ten years.
Lots more where he came from.
You better not like him too much.
I like Michael.
You like Michael.
I can still remember too.
You can still remember home.
and had red hair.
I was there too.
They were watching me.
This is Michael.
There's only three weeks left of summer Michael.
I'd like you to meet him.
-- If there's a girl we could talk about her.
Then let's act like friends.
Let's talk.
I know this is a new place and --
Michael I want you to do this.
You come home late.
You do exactly what you want...
tonight do what I want for a change.
I watch him all day.
The only time I have more myself is at night.
I'm up.
Michael are you still in bed?
I'll pass.
I get off in another twenty minutes.
Why do we have to go home?
He looks dead.
Is everybody all right?!
Not another word!
Stop it right now!
They know that we know about them.
You've got to tell the police!
They'll listen to you.
They'll believe you...
there's plenty for everybody...
He's already gone to bed.
Where's Michael?
I thought I saw something out the window.
I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
He met a girl.
So many times I'm starting to think it happened to me.
You've heard this story before?
Not that poor.
I thought we were poor.
Tell them to get something to eat.
We're getting close...
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
One big happy family.
what are you talking about?
what do I know?
Let me tell you something about boys.
Let's give it one more try.
Dinner at my house tomorrow night.
He's just not like this.
They come from all over.
listen I know I have no right to ask you this...
Work with kids in some way.
I'm not looking for a tape.
What I need is --
We've got it all.
I like that in a person.
Did you know that!?
I just want to be your friend.
I feel it!
You've got to put this on.
David's looking for me...
I know I've felt it...
but each night...
Then it's not too late for us...
You were supposed to be mine...
I'm just like them!
Can I come up?
no everything's different now...
Let's go see them.
They've made me one of them but I miss my family.
Now you and David...
Michael's great.
I'm Michael.
I just wanted to...
Did you want to talk to me?
Is she one of them?
Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
You've got to help me.
What did you to do him Michael?
What happened Michael!?
It's not happening.
It's just not happening.
On the phone.
Do I have to do this?
Just five minutes okay?
I was here first.
This room is mine.
I can see it later.
What do you want from us?
Sixteen for how long?!
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
hour and a half...
How long were you with the dog?
Well where was he?
Well after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.
When I came back he was gone.
Just anything at all?
Any little thing?
What do you mean ""got"" to the dog?
So what's our problem?
Look I know it's hard to believe...
Okay with you?
It was just a dog.
I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Now why'd you go and...
Well who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Nobody's getting in here.
You can tell them all that!
I think the whole process would have taken an hour...
And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
We got to it before it had time to finish or...
You must let me back in...
I've changed my mind...
I hear funny things out here.
Watch him close.
We've got to talk this over.
Nothing could stop it!
It wanted to become us!
He's so close.
Let's open it.
If it did get to him.
Now who'd go and do...
Happens all the time man.
Government knows all about it...
find a light...
I said where?
Where'd you go?!
I found this...
Somebody's taken it.
I'm working it!
Nothing's happening!
What's taking you?!
could be one of them.
Then we'll never make it.
try and get some help.
Not the only one.
What do you mean ""you think so?
He put it together piece by piece.
For your health.
Where is everybody?!
you stay here...
Well hang on!
What do we do about those three?
He's gone already!
Where's the other half?
That's good enough.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What do you want from me anyway.
Well go on.
Now hold him.
Would that test have worked?
Could be important work.
Might as well bring it back.
My God what in hell happened here?
A couple of hours.
Could be anything...
got out of hand...
I'd like to go up.
Nothing we can do about that.
A day or so ago...
When was the last time you used it?
Can there be...
some kind of test?
To find out who's what?
Started with six.
There'd be four others left.
How many in their party?
How far's that?
I'll put this right through your head.
Put that down!
Well stick with it.
We got to get help in here...
Well stick to it.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else man.
Little over two hours.
How long's it been?
Should be enough.
we'll do you last...
We're on fire!
What are you talking?!
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Another ten fifteen minutes.
Would I be asking if it were there?
And that was enough?
I though we stopped it in time.
Then get a move on.
Oh I got you.
Not too long.
What is it out there anyway?
He might just wait us out.
It needs us.
If he's one of those Things we've got to get to him before he changes...
you know who's who?
Bet the last place you ever go.
Then we go after him.
And it's like all over the place...
Chance we got to take.
He's over.
Where was he trying to go?
Just keep looking.
Well let's get down there.
What's happened?!
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
So what do you make of it?
It's in between us and them!!
When do you think it got to him?
He's one of them.
But there's nothing here.
Just about here.
Well you wanted to see it.
I'll be all right...
You go back to the village and light the fire.
So we can find our way home.
Please just listen to me...
I think we should go on by ourselves.
He never talked about it after that.
I had a friend who came here once.
No one ever comes here.
They tell all the children.
You have books?!
There might be history.
The Hall of Books.
There's a place that might help...
We're not supposed to think about it.
Do you have any idea where they take them?
What else can they do?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
Exactly like you.
And everyone looks like us?
I should hope not...
Make them read my books.
Tell them who they are.
Who they could be.
I'll never forget this.
Go back to the light.
I was made for this moment.
Good to have someone to talk to for a change...
But you need to go.
Take her out of here...
Nothing to do I'm afraid.
For a while anyway.
This has to end.
Listen to me it was wrong to bring you.
Why did they built it?
What's it all for?
Do you know which way?
Do you know that saying?
But you've done enough.
Thank you for your help...
Are you sure you want to do this?
This is the way in?
It's what they want you to see.
So do we go on?
It was meant to.
I saw this.
hold on a minute.
Send him home.
Send him away.
When was his mother taken?
I'm used to that.
You were meant to help.
To be with people.
Why should I help you?
Can you show us where they live?
I was lucky.
They used us much as your people did.
Do you know where they live?
You know of them?
Please we need your help.
have you a name?
Well what's left of one.
What's left of all of them actually.
I am the last...
How did you know?!
You are from the past yes?
I think you should become.
You'll like it here.
If I can only find the right door...
Now will you go?
After all you've seen...
you still believe that?
A man can change his history.
None of them will.
That is how history works.
But you should be happy for her.
So you take their best...
I could tell them.
Why would you come back to this?
Say I just come back again?
And you are the past.
Why would you let me go back?
Go back to where you came from.
This is the world now.
I am fact.
Have you completely lost all sense of --
It's just how we live now.
You did that.
We make them see what we wish.
You have my word...
Next time then.
Tell you all about her.
How did you know to do that?
I was getting to that...
Can I tell you more?
I -- what are you?!
I have something for you...
It's only a machine.
Never like this.
And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
We took a walk three days ago.
Just walking down the street with you again.
I hope you're not coming down with something.
I want to get into the light that's all.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
let's walk through the city.
Let's walk through the park...
to talk to you.
Got here as soon as I could.
I know I have it...
All right what is it now?
talk to you.
Well there's something new.
was my home.
Good night David.
In a week...
we will never have had this conversation.
I'll come for dinner.
Get on one of them.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I'm working on something now.
That's where you're wrong.
I will change it.
Do you find her?
I have to make the decision.
And I just stand there...
I know that --
I live with it every minute of every day.
It's part of you now and it always will be.
But you have to learn to live with it...
I care more about my life.
You used to care about your work.
You know that's what it is.
You care for me.
And you're concerned.
And I have to start living my life again.
I hear it from Mrs.
There are some things I need to say to you.
He's nine years old.
I told him no.
I'm sorry David.
And then every week.
Then every other month.
Then I stopped coming.
I've been working.
She's a fine girl and she's done wonderful things for you.
At that moment -- I just knew.
In the future we'll be better.
God and I'm running late --
Tonight's the night?
All right all right -- here -- everything --
Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.
I wish you the very best.
but yes this is about the kitchen.
Take him away from here --
Take him back to your time.
Go back to your own time?
So you can use it now?
Good -- it looks fine.
I know what it is to lose someone.
When my husband was taken from us...
I thank you for that.
If you only knew...
The future had to be better.
You lost someone.
You know this?
they're the same...
I suppose it was.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Oh it was...
Most of the time.
Night and day.
Oh very much...
It was a great city.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.
I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them...
our place in the world.
How do you decide?
It's all the same here.
Everyone has an important job to do.
It's always been this way here.
It's just beautiful...
I mean why do you do it?
It's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be beautiful.
And this is your ""work""?
All of you?
Good night then.
Not like this...
You can see so many here.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You're still not well.
I'll take you tomorrow...
Or forward into the future.
Can you go back?
I know it's hard to believe but it's true.
Now where do you come from?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.
Where I come from there's so much...
He's gone to a better place.
Your husband is dead?
it's just his way.
It's rather hard to explain.
You're up!
That'll be all.
May I get you some --
All right Mrs.
You can go.
Tell him to go away --
Yes sir he --
Now that's more like it.
What's the matter with --?
-- What would I do without you Mrs.
Do you have it?!
Of seeing our place in it!
Might I ask why?
Well just as I thought.
Exactly correct sir.
This is the world.
We are what we are.
Then it's time to change that --
It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
How can you just do nothing!?
They're your friends your family.
They've gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
We have to go after them find where --!
Where do they take them?!
My father has gone to a better place.
Your father perhaps?
To live in.
There's a lot of us...
Oh very different.
What are your people called?
Well we're happy you're here.
If I might explain sir --
Young man we have a way of doing things here.
Sir if I may --
There's no one here but us.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
I want to see your home.
Will you take me?
What's it like where you come from?
What did you do at night?
I found you.
I think I might be.
But there'll be some changes made.
And you've no idea where he went?
He's been gone this whole week.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
We never should have done this to him...
Should we be what?
Trying to change him any way we can?
Should we be...
I'm in it as we speak.
You just told me.
How did you come to know their names?
Of people like you.
People I was just trying to help.
Years ago in the hospital.
how are you here?
I'm not his son.
I'm him.
I'm the real thing.
Your eyes say you do.
You in here.
And what does that mean?
You sure you know where to find one?
Getting away with things.
I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour.
And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
All I know is that you left me in there.
It's not my job to believe you.
Depends on what you're seeing.
I'm just looking at you.
Someone had to have given him it.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
Oh yeah what'd he say?
My father used to talk about you.
Did you know my father?
I'll tell you about it later.
What should they be looking for?
they might care about what we're doing wrong.
It's already been decided.
I need to get this letter to someone.
You done with your small talk?
You look like you've lost some weight.
If she was here at the time your father was then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I wish I knew more.
It's just a cut.
But we need to get you to the hospital now.
Get me something to take to her.
To the hospital.
Why are you saying that?
That's all you got from him?
It's Sunday.
Of course he will.
I'm real and so is where we are.
How can you have a street with no cars on it?
There're no cars on this street.
They're not here.
I called the number yesterday to make sure.
Here drink this.
There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
I might not be able to.
You've got to get yourself out of that place.
He never told them what happened to you over there.
How long do we have?
Did they figure it out after I died?
We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you.
It's the only thing we can do.
Do you really believe me?
But no one knew until after...
That's what they call it right?
But look at me.
I met you and your mother.
I know what this is...
But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink.
Right now I do though.
And I want you out.
I looked it up.
You had no right to go through anything.
I think I can remember what's on them.
What're those?
And things are different.
He just said...
How did he help?
A little far out there but easy enough.
You know how to get there?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
You did in the future.
That's how it works.
Who told you this?
Listen to me...
I do believe you...
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
You or me?
You told me this was how it happened.
how do you know?
I know it all.
You told me about him.
I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him.
So you told me.
I only saw it as part of my own life.
What about the world?
Not for people like me.
Tell me about the future.
Well what time is it?
Tell me what you do know.
This has nothing to do with that.
Then help me understand.
That's what I'm saying to you.
Why would we do that?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
How'd he get it?
At the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Yeah I did.
I never knew my father.
My God you look exactly like him.
You should be careful.
I could try to...
make it stop.
Why what would you do?
Not my mind.
You may never remember at all.
So what am I supposed to do?
Oh no you're pretty young.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Yeah you were.
What were you talking about the other day?
Great get in.
Can you drive?
It's worse than war.
It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Never knew my father.
She was great though.
I mean the way she was with her friends...
But as of now I never knew either.
So you never knew your mother?
May be easy to remember but not easy to get.
you tell me if that's simple.
But hey who can forget those words?
How hard can that be to remember?
You remember it?
Well good for you.
Shit happens and your life changes.
This is pretty good.
I'm sorry if...
Well how'd you get here?
It'd be too simple.
Well where are you from?
Let me ask you that again.
You'll be back today.
only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
I may not even make it home for dinner.
You want anything special for dinner?
Have a good day at work today.
That's what everybody says.
Yeah I could too.
If just one person would say...
There's two girls out there that had a chance they had a chance...!
How do you know I took it?
He also says that at that time he met a man.
He also told us that you and Mrs.
"" Is that true?
Do you know her too?
She did good!
Has anybody asked his wife?
She's the one I hope did it.
Who do you think did it?
Let us think about that.
You want to come on in?
I do believe you.
That's what I want everybody to believe.
I need you to help me here.
You're still with us though.
You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
I'll buy.
We're both fine.
You girls are in some hot water.
I have no problem with that.
That's certainly possible.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Well you'd best get something.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
I'd tell you if I knew!
I'm trying to remember everything!
He probably knows something.
This is serious son.
A man is dead.
Just some young guy.
Around twenty years old.
Tell us about him.
Get a hold of yourself!
He already got all their money.
It's just not working like this.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.
We want to try and find out where they are.
Are you close with her?
Someone will be here until we find them.
Just take the money.
No I mean how would you do it?
What did ya do?
I'm just some guy.
You all take care.
I always knew that.
Same goes double for me.
I'll say I never found you.
I'll say anything you want.
We'll find a way to get you out of this whatever it is.
I just want you to be happy...
I'm the one...
I never made it work.
I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought...
get a job.
Of some kind.
it's beautiful!
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Does it have something to do with another guy?
Are you in love with him?
But can I ask you one thing?
Okay okay just tell me what's the trouble.
Tell Daddy everything.
Can we get another room?
It's under your name.
Where do I go?
What is it for?
You'd know him if you saw him.
His brother was in your class.
I was afraid I'd missed you.
It's Saturday.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Call me back.
In an hour.
Tell me now.
No for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.
I need that money.
I need you to help me.
I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.
I come back nobody knows where you are.
No I'm out of town.
I'm in...
Are you in town?
I am funny.
I'm real funny.
Am I in trouble?
Walk around and get in the car please.
Is this your car?
You're a good friend.
All this for us?
What in the hell is it?!
What in the hell is that up there?
How do you stay so positive?
I know it is.
Did you see that guy?!
He was right in the middle of the road!
How long do you think that'll take?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
You were right about what happened to me there.
What's that supposed to mean exactly?
I mean really!
See if that's him!
We should head a little further in.
It'd have to be pretty good.
We can change our names.
Everything looks different.
I know you know what I mean.
Everything looks new.
Do you feel like that?
Like you've got something to look forward to?
You could call it that.
My eyes are open.
Well let me know when you figure it out.
I mean in a way you've got something to go back for.
I said all the rest.
I said all that?
I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.
Nobody would believe us.
We'd still get in trouble.
What'd I say again?
You know why.
You already said.
Yeah you want it?
You just keep that shit away from me now I mean it.
But if you ever met my husband you'd know why I just can...
I am really sorry about this.
He may not know.
What do you want to do?!
That's what happened...
Just the look on his face when you...
it's not funny.
What about him?!
I hate this guy.
Well you got it now.
I just never got the opportunity.
This is so beautiful.
I mean look how different he looks just since high school.
You mean now or before?
No matter what happens.
Now what what?
What's he got to lose?
I asked him not to tell.
Fill her up.
There's a phone right over there.
It was just you and me there.
We got away!
To find out if he knows anything.
They think we like it.
Why do they have to do that?
I believe I am!
Nobody would ever believe it.
Well I just...
I mean what did you say?
Well we need the money.
Now we have it.
You want anything?
Do I seem different?
What happened to your hair?
It's hard enough as it is.
Just let me get this part over with.
He is a lucky man.
The boy has got it bad.
I love to watch him go.
I wish you could meet him.
How come you never said what happened?
I just wanted to know you were alright.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
It's probably not a good idea.
Will I be?
Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Everything's changed now...
Are you coming with me?
Are you up to this?
I mean I have to know.
You talked to him?!
I think better when I drive.
Did you finish thinking?
You care more about that car than you do about most people.
If we just give 'em some time they'll come to us...!
You could help me try and figure it out!
How am I supposed to act?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.
How much money do you have with you?
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Our next move?
I sure am having a good time.
We have to think this through.
Nobody saw it.
Nobody knows it was us.
We're still okay.
Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Just tell 'em what happened.
Tell them what?!
What do you think we should tell them?
I mean I think we should tell the police.
Just shut up a minute so I can think.
I which way?
Get the car!
Ready when you are.
So let's have some!
So what if he was?
Then what difference does it make if we stop?
I never get to do stuff like this.
I'll never make it...
Another hour of so.
We've got enough food for a month.
Well he has never let me go.
All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
How come he let you go?
We'd have to.
In case of what?
I will too.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I'll be there around two or three.
I'll call you right back.
Are you at work?
It's just two days.
Well wait now.
Say you're sorry.
I hate that!
We're fine!
No I just meant...
The thing's kind of heavy.
I'll try to be more careful.
How many we talking?
I did it and we all know it.
Just one pair!
Somebody help me!!!!!
Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
I'm asking you to leave.
That's what I want to tell ya.
You were right -- I needed help.
You sent that?
You have kids a great wife.
Now I want her back.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You're actually thinking like a girl.
They love that.
Okay sounds like you're all set.
Plenty of gas?
She's even more beautiful than I remember.
You've gone through way too much to back down now.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Well then you've got to call her man.
No You mean...?
Never met him.
On your day off?
Do you even know the guy?
I mean I've still got my health...
I'm out of here.
I've got to get up at six a.
Wait a second I never told you that.
Life is too fucking short.
He'll do better than that.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Look maybe they're right it's been a long time.
So that was it?
A few years ago.
I mean since then.
Each day is better than the next.
Have you ever been you know...
in love with someone?
It must be great with a wife like that.
They're all good looking.
Yeah that's more or less what the others said too.
Out getting coffee...
supposed to meet him here...
Out getting coffee.
I see you made the news.
who love him a lot too...
and so on.
especially after what I did.
You found my car?!
Jesus you know what?
Here just have one of these then.
Take it easy that's Bill.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find.
You hot shit.
Why would I pick you?
and I'm really happy.
see you tonight right?
I feel like a dog.
No forget it it was stupid.
Well I'll see ya.
-- Love story of our time.
Try to be.
Ah I'd sell that.
Look at this...
No I mean
The hell with that.
By the way what's your name?
Same here again.
Well it was nice meeting you again.
That's been my experience anyway.
That's a place I've always wanted to go.
You own a home there?
Not in months.
Have you been?
It means he's a guy.
Well I was sick of it man!
No more -- it was my turn.
It was time for me...
time for me...
to be happy.
You're a sick man you know that?
Hey hey hey!
Well they go that way too.
I thought  That's not it anyway.
I still feel something for her.
All the same I still want to call her.
Well I think you're right I should look her up.
You sure big guy?
Anyway the good news is I have all the information you need.
And you were right she's really something.
I think your life's about to change.
I've got some very very good news for you my friend.
You get fifty a day period.
Look let's forget it.
Let's forget the whole thing.
Sure she is.
You're a real piece of work.
She's a friend of mine.
Well I know you're busy...
All you want is a phone number?
She might've moved ten times since then.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Oh that makes a lot of sense.
You probably did it yourself you piece of shit.
Hey this is a pretty nice place.
How many is that?
Why you son of a --
I knew shit.
You know I really should take your card.
Check it out next time you're up there.
Do you know the...
I was there twice last year.
Which building is yours?
You mean him.
That sounds great.
I'd go with the seven.
Two million man.
I'm nothing.
I want someone who will enjoy him the way I do.
Ah she's okay.
He was a god.
What about what's-his-name...
You'll probably need it before I will.
Oh yeah of course dear.
This one's almost thirty years old.
So who's the lucky guy?
Have you been up all night again?
Okay I think I know what to do.
I'll call him right now.
I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
I think you'd better sit down.
I just think you should be careful with this guy.
Anyway I called some friends back east.
Not long at all but I really like him.
He's a guy.
A real guy.
And that's okay with me.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out.
How long have you known him?
No no the bigger the better.
Did you do something with your hair?
Where would I have seen your work?
Get over here.
What what are you doing here?
really go for?
I just thought --
to be honest...
and then it was all over.
I did come close once -- just last year in fact.
And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
I bet it works out for you.
Trying to be.
We've got a lot in common.
You know what I'd like to see?
I agree there should be more.
Okay sometimes I'm a nineteen.
We should play some time...
I mean if you can afford to lose some money.
No short game.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Well lucky for me I found out.
Let's talk about you.
How about tomorrow night?
that sounds awful.
Well you look great.
No it was a good thing.
I mean good in that it was very quick.
By the way how's he doing?
You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
And did everything --?
Oh he can hold you.
Oh are you on the team?
You're looking at him.
It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
I think a little of both.
She'll know what to do.
No please sir --
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
All right these things happen let me have a look.
It's not the end of the world.
What seems to be the situation here?
You shit yourself or something?
Jesus Christ guy what the hell were you doing?!
You're about twenty minutes late.
I mean is it...
what exactly are we looking at here?
Oh that's a good one.
Yeah I'll bet you all were.
No no no I'll be fine.
Well there's only one thing to do.
Now I've seen it all.
What the hell were you thinking?
Everything okay here?
So is that a yes or a no?
But that sounds great yeah.
It's no big deal whatever I mean if you want.
If you think he can hold me.
Get out of our way Mr.
We need to be able to do our jobs.
All they say about him today is --
That's all well and good but what do we say to 'em?
We need a little more time to figure this one out.
We've got bigger problems right now.
We have to pull him.
Somebody had to say it.
Then you'll call right?
I need it by Saturday.
Make it happen.
We've got to use it.
Just wanted to see for myself.
We gave so much to get here.
Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
So now you've got to talk him out of it.
So now what?
What does the letter say?
The deal's off.
We've been trying to find you all morning.
-- I'm just trying to make a point.
This idea is that fucking bad.
Something your father would've come up with.
Give it a rest.
The other thing is...
Every day the sun comes up...
says something about us.
But it did.
The sun came up today.
-- You listen to me.
They may be wrong.
But these people are right.
Then they should speak up.
I think it's a bad idea.
We meet them there.
What's it about?
I need to see him now...
How much time?
There are two conditions.
Then we have no choice.
-- I have the authority.
We're looking at another week and a half Mr.
The problem Mr.
I saw you out there.
You want him to call you back need you.
A thing like this...
I think we've won.
What happens to you?
Tomorrow's the big day.
I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow.
You need to do something about this.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me.
You can have him on the way home.
Who was he talking to?
You said to call.
I want an hour with him.
But you've got his heart.
Back to work.
Remember to hit 'em hard.
We give them something.
You're sure...
They know each other!
I've got to move.
And at the end of the day they may end up being right.
They have to go in and they have to do it right.
They're starting in what?
They want this fucking job they can have it.
And he has more experience than anyone.
Then we need to do a few things right away.
He knows the press knows.
George Ball's got a conference room at State.
Should be here any minute.
So what've we got today?
You were in the room.
You've got the most important job in the world right now.
Moving the line.
We'll deal with it.
The press'll be all over it.
Last night's letter was.
That may be what they want us to think.
This could be more of the same.
Just a second Mr.
I'm afraid not Mr.
Bet you had a late night.
I have a number man.
That's not even your name is it?
Just let them go.
Our police are afraid of them.
Please get them out of here.
Oh I'm set Sir.
I'm set.
That's just the way it is.
James Looks Twice?
It's not the first.
There's been several.
Oh yeah -- right.
His mother needs a piece of his hair.
Has to be kept for four days.
What the hell you doing?!
-- did you understand me when I said that --
They done that to one of our girls once.
I know where I am.
It's your call.
Let the press through.
Anyone who was standing in the way of the land.
Never turn your radio off!
Jesus you alright?
This is part of it.
It's the car.
Well she's running now too.
He's out there.
All I could think of was...
And get rid of the dog.
I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure.
When did we get that?
The right man?
A long way from home.
You be careful out there.
I gave it back to her.
She took something from the house.
We're not doing our job.
Some kind of statement.
I got one up on ya.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy that's for sure.
we'll be here.
but you bought her some time.
What about the water...
We're in there.
We're in there --
Get us in there we got a chance.
They got him.
You go to the council fire.
What we need...
You better wait here.
Listen to the water...
That's what we're doing here.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
What's with you Man?
You were running with the old ones.
And I was running with other people.
Ya never know when.
So we can do what the old man said.
So you can get rid of me too?
You have to come with me.
Where'd ya take her.
Next time I'll be ready.
You get the word to who ever it is.
Not no more.
Cut the shit.
You're right about the old man.
That's all I'm saying.
What's real to you?
What'd you expect to hear?
It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids.
I'm late.
The old man?
Like a white man.
So did this one.
She's your sister?
Listen to the water.
He also said ""listen to the water.
Why should I tell you.
What was he saying?
He knows me?
He sent me to find ya.
He says he's got information.
I'm giving you a break.
-- his mother never lived here.
His mother's place is --
You got no know-how.
Whether you get him or I get him I just want him.
-- Well maybe two-seventeen.
I'd say he goes two-ten two-fifteen --
Hey you listen up --
Said it meant...
In your eyes that's power.
And left it for me...
Now I know he is.
All over again.
I'm on my way back in.
Somebody took it down.
If he starts to leave the area move in.
And hold him.
I see what you're saying...
But --  I am not an...
Father's side.
I'm not that sure.
Yeah I think --
Do you want a coffee?
All I know...
is I did what I did...
Take me back.
What's with you man?
I took him out before he got the chance.
It's out and it knows.
Were you there?
who were they?
Maybe I can talk to them.
How the hell do you know?
What do you people want?
Your word against my word.
I really got a chance man right?
What's with you people?
I came through man.
Get up out of the chair Richard.
Not for long Richard.
Richard do you know why I'm here?
What ya want?
How long you been in it?
I live here remember?
I'll think of something...
I think I have...
I could be wrong.
I have been before.
Just remember one thing.
I hope you find him.
I just get happy being with the right man.
"" That about it?
I mean I did...
I was later.
We'll say it together.
And that's one!
You'd do anything to take it back.
It was a question.
Off me or off you?
Take something off.
The one that's most on your mind.
How does it go?
Want to play the game?
Not as silly as some.
that we can turn back time...
That's a pretty silly game.
How do you play that?
What do you do when you come here?
nothing really changes.
You look way out there.
Out past the date line.
or tomorrow I forget which.
I'm not good company.
Do what show you a good time?
You know where we are.
I come here sometimes...
You knew it.
You all do.
It's part of it.
Maybe the most important part.
He was a friend of mine.
A good guy...
You knew about it of course.
This is it then.
they say you're alright.
Where'd you get it.
What do you take me for?
I'm still second best.
In that order?
You always get what you want?
And now I want you.
It's just as I thought.
She had a long time to think about it.
Think of everything you'll miss.
All you've got is one life.
You ever see an old woman after her husband has died?
That's your whole future.
That's as far as it goes.
What he said...
That's it of course.
Living too long.
That's why you're up there.
It's him or me.
You're part of it.
It's more honest this way.
You're horrible
Let's make it at eight.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Used to what?
A walk in the park.
How about anything anything you want to do.
How about what?
Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for.
Well how about it?
And probably never again.
What if he's not?
Some one comes up hot on your six what do you do?
I thought there was something...
That night in the club...
Give me a break I'm asking you out.
I'll give you that!
I'm special.
I work here.
I was out of line.
Well what you need...
what you have to keep looking for...
Then you've got something.
It never came up.
On his six.
Not in this case.
It's what?
Where did you see that?
I saw one.
And I asked someone.
That's all!
How did you know this was my car?
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I thought he'd never leave.
I'm with someone.
Can I walk you out?
I heard of one once.
Yeah most likely.
And on to a bigger one with you?
I could be too.
It is that too.
Now I know why all the girls come here.
Anything I can do for you?
I'll bet!
Remember one thing.
But you have to be ready.
What do you...
I do Sir.
What   is   it?
I KNOW IT.
ON THE LEVEL.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
It'll be where your head used to be.
AND I LIVE.
TELL HIM WILL YOU TELL HIM?
We're not!
We're okay.
We're level.
Something's wrong!
Bring it left.
Bring it left You're high.
Hey if it was easy everybody would want to come up here and do it.....
What is he doing?
Let's hope you're right!
Let me do the talking.
Anything we want.
I'm right behind you.
But I have to!
You're not supposed to...
We did it...
We sure did it!
Is it you?
Is there something I should know?
I've got it -- hold on!
Now have you got it?
Have you still got it?
You've GOT it!!?
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Whatever it is you've got it!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
Why do you all have such funny names?
Got you here.
What do you think it was?
It's the house drink.
I think yeah we'll show you a thing or two.
You think you can stay up with us.
Time to go.
Where do you find the time?
under the pressure.
Having a woman here is asking for it.
What what are you doing?
We're cover!
I want him!
STAY WITH HIM!
I've had enough...
It's double or nothing..
Come on we're next.
How ya doing in there?
It's more like...
He should've had me.
Call for a draw.
On your six -- coming hard.
I've lost him -- where is he?
You ever done this before?
Look at the weather!
They'll never find us!
I died enough for one night.
Well you'll just have to make do with him.
He's the best of the best!
The fact is he's lost it.
He knows it.
You were up there you know it too.
He's the best you have.
I'll talk to him.
He won again.
Until last night.
You can be mine!
We're on the same team.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
IT MIGHT GET YOU.
NO I GOT HIM.
I CAN TAKE HIM.
NO NO NO HE'S MINE.
I'M IN.
STAY OUT OF IT.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT.
I'M ON MY WAY IN.
GET OUT OF THERE.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
HE'S MINE.
I've heard of you too.
I've heard that about you.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Who is the best.
Who's the hell is that?
It's only been a week.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Tell me one thing.
What makes you think we can get back in?
What the hell you doing?
Ya think he knows it was me?
You are maybe...
So this is your chance.
They are better than you.
Now you are.
I talked a man back once.
Three months later we lost him.
It's his decision.
Only he knows.
I'll have to think about it.
We'd hate to lose it.
Would you take me back?
a better man.
You and I know what really happened.
You know what I'll carry it too.
It's no trade-off.
It's not one for one.
But maybe there is some value in it.
Now the question is what will you do with it.
that's good.
That's one good thing.
How can I go on?
I feel so...
I never heard that.
He thought he knew better.
He was by the book all the way.
You may not think so but you are.
I'm nothing like him.
You're just like he was only better...
They need to know you're all right...
Every second Sunday.
My wife's house.
I called your house.
That's all I want to do.
It's what I do best.
I am real good.
For the same reason you are.
It's my own way.
It works for me.
Do it our way.
We've worked these things out.
Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
I just did it.
I took it.
Is that how you remember it?
I had him in view.
A good man.
Now put your fucking hands in the air!
What happened to number five?
Well actually no...
You're getting off to an early start.
So where to?
Over there man.
What's wrong with this one?
How could you do this?
But maybe you can change all that.
Shut up and drive!
There you go Mr.
Get it please.
Nice to have you back with us Mr.
You're nobody!
Who gives a shit what you believe?
Do you expect me to believe you?
Turn it on.
You got what you want.
Give these people air!
Not true he's one of my best friends...
--That's right.
Who is it this time--my mother?
All of that was set up by us.
We gave you lots of help.
Get your story straight.
That's what we wanted you to think.
Now let's get down to business.
Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.
--Do you think you can play along?
Who told you to think?!
You do what you're told!!
That's what you do!
He had help.
From our side sir.
Have you got that?
That's now.
He knows too much.
put his head in place.
Around the corner.
And if anybody comes asking...
I've been trying to tell you.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
He's really been there.
I'm with an very important client.
You better get down here.
And how do you like your women?
Suppose I do...
You open it.
She's real.
What about the girl?
I'm sorry to tell you this Mr.
I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
everybody pull out!
Pull them out.
Not since you lost him.
They found us!
That's why we brought you here.
On his way.
Hey hey Tony.
Give the big guy a break.
Come on let's go have that drink.
What are you my father?
Yeah you did.
I told you not to but you did anyway.
Look at this shit.
He's not at ground level.
I've got him.
Up to the right.
Just go -- OH SHIT!!
Where can I...?
I want you to come back to me.
I suppose you're not here either.
After all we've been through?
It's time you found out.
There's something I want you to know.
I just work here.
If I'm not me then who the hell am I?
The job's real.
I never saw you before six weeks ago!
The hell you're not.
I'm not your wife.
I said TALK!!
What did they do to you?
Let me finish!
Tell me exactly what happened?
You are somebody.
You're the man I love.
I feel I was meant for something more than this.
I want to do something with my life.
--I want to be somebody.
All right forget about it.
And you believe him?
Just think about it.
You mean it?
But I'm always home by morning.
The one you told me about.
They'll be here any minute!
How much is that?
I'm not interested in that.
You're the same.
No matter where you go there you are.
Always the same old you.
Whatever you say...
How real does it seem?
That a problem?
Good to see ya.
Right this way.
I just has a terrible thought...
You sure about this?
We've got to get air!!
The one in the mine!
I'm not sure dear?
Are you still you?
Oh since when?
All sorts of things.
That's my cover.
By the way...
I said get out!
I think you better leave.
Let's forget everything!
Forget I said wife.
How stupid of me...
Wait did you say wife?...
There's something I have to tell you...
So here I am good-bye.
Come get it and keep moving.
I gave you?
What the hell is that anyway?
They're pretty quick...
How much you think?
We had food water...
That's four.
Yeah like they got a plan...
Ready as we'll ever be.
""Sorry time to move.
Phone's out.
Road's out.
If we're not ready...
Let's go you two.
We know what they are!
They're big things under the ground!
Much bigger than we thought!
They're coming after you!
They're coming right now!
What's under the ground?
They're under the ground!
What the hell you doing back already?
Take your radio!
Then we'll talk okay?!
I'm on forty-nine.
we were on it not two hours ago...
well it's completely...
Where the hell are they?
We go straight.
THEY'RE COMING!
He'll never make it!
For a whole year.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
I might have an idea...
No way those are local boys.
and we've just never seen one till now.
This is important you know.
Anyway sorry to bother you.
Well we'll ask around.
Let you know if we hear of anything.
You are so full of shit...
I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
What the hell is wrong?!
Somebody paying you to do this?
Road's in!
Not yet not yet...
Light it man!
What the hell are you doing?!!
I want to live for the three days.
It's out last one.
they're trying to make us move!
that's it.
What the hell are they doing?
They're up to something.
Only if something happens to me.
Like hell you are.
We got a plan!
we could pull something!
No way they could stop it.
Could we take the Cat?
We need another plan.
Shut it up!
You go north I'll go south.
Run for it?
Running's not a plan.
You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
It's been listening to us.
It's got no eyes.
Been waiting there all this time.
How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Maybe it's long gone.
I think we wait right here.
We'll take your word for it.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...
Come on nobody's ever seen one of these!
This is one big mother!
What the hell are they?
What the hell are those things?
Here's the plan...
Car's gone.
We just missed them that's all.
Well there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.
Brother we decided to leave this place just one day too late you know?
I'll go with that plan.
And then what did they do?
That's him I'm telling you.
You're full of shit.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
She's got us.
Forget it man.
for a year or two.
That's got no future.
So what if we just did it...
Here with you.
They're all the same: dead weight.
But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
The new one!
That's supposed to be a girl!
Must be the new one.
Who the hell's that?
That's not what's his name...
You never take the long view.
Hell here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.
It is Monday right?
Let's do their kitchen today.
I was in one.
Is it like three or more?
Hell you did.
Did it yesterday.
I'd do the same.
Just tell us what you need.
Let's change that plan.
Get away from it!
Am I sure?!
It was right there.
You sure this is where it was?
Well what's wrong with it?
Let's finish in the morning.
I've got a plan.
Get us some help.
The phone is out!
LET'S DO IT!
There they go!
I think we do it.
Something to keep them busy.
They're working together too.
Why do you all keep asking me?
What's it doing?
One two three...
Listen got a question for you.
I've heard all about you.
That-a-boy.
We're both dead.
And one good guy.
For three years...
Where did you go with the body?
An hour after you picked it up!
I brought it...
In other words seven times out of a hundred you're wrong!
No more than seven percent.
It most certainly is.
No it is not Mr.
Straight up First --
Let go of my hair.
The hell you do.
At this hour?
I have to talk to your brother.
If it please the court I'd like to call Mr.
And we look out for each other.
No it's not the only issue.
No further questions.
Not the whole time of course.
How can you remember that?
Not at all --
I've seen this picture before.
She just about told me...!
Hey -- you believe what you want.
A dead end.
Believe me I'm sorry too but...
He called and...
I feel much better now.
There's no one else to talk to.
Are you sure we want that?
You really think that's what happened?
Eight years ago.
What other case?
We're taking the other case.
Just ask 'em...
Ten years is a long time.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
I have no more questions for you.
For ten years now.
You're doing good work.
Particularly at this hour...
He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Right out of here.
And now I'd like to hear everything.
-- How could I help you?
I told you what you needed to know.
So tell me what you do know -- say it!
You tell me, man.
What went down?
What went down.
wanted you to think he was...
But why would a guy would do that?
Exactly what happened then?
Want to tell me what went down here?
My mother find you?
You left your telephone number?
That person will ask you lots of questions.
To all of us?
Then what did he say?
I hope so Mr.
In those days they often worked as a team.
-- that I'll see him in court.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
What does it take to make you go away?
You're the one talking deal.
Yes but that's not the issue.
What're you looking for here?
This and that.
So what've you been up to since then?
what's the man's name?
No -- leave him be.
It's better for everyone.
It was always like that.
You getting this?
So what'd this guy do?
What were you...
You mean to say Mr.
Yeah, we do some of that.
Do you remember talking to the police?
What is she doing right now?
She's in high school.
Tell me some other things about her.
Let's test it for the record.
Either right now or right when I thought of it.
Who are you REALLY?
That's not important.
I will tell you what is important.
I am not talking to you.
You used to not let me talk to you.
No go away.
And my little round friends too.
We can do it right here.
Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
The stuff we got last night.
I'm nearly out.
WHERE WERE YOU?
WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Where were you for the last hour?
We got a phone here that's got a little ring.
Any idea what happened to it?
Maybe not a thing but maybe two things.
What the hell is that thing doing out there?
You're not taking that body anywhere.
We close at five.
Where's the body?
My boys have been all over this.
It's a dead end.
Yep it sure is.
Can you tell me what their names were?
What was here Mr.
After that I never saw him again.
Not a lot around here no.
Was there an argument?
She had a friend with her.
The friend took off.
Did she have someone with her?
I could ask you the same question.
Maybe I just live here what do you think about that?
Okay that's it.
I've had enough of the waiting room now.
I heard about that.
SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU.
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
HE'S GONE.
No sir we did not.
And no one found the ring?
Tell me about the letter.
Which we did.
You are here and there is no place to go...
And how can I leave?
Someone else has it now.
Where is the ring?
Ever see her with someone else?
Sorry to hear it.
He's dead -- good and dead.
I just thought I ought to tell you.
He's with me.
No I do not.
There was only one job.
Never saw her again.
What happened to her?
Could've been her sister.
She only worked here a month.
Never seemed to get here on time though.
Ask me she had a little problem with --
Say no more.
Take a good look around.
If you ever need me.
I give it.
She must have known someone.
I think that's a good idea.
It's not late it's early.
There's something up there.
Sure but let's finish up with this first.
Maybe later we could take a look.
And no one had a machine like this.
That's what I heard.
I'll explain it to you.
That was really something.
What did it mean?
And I love you too.
All my things have me in them.
How did I get in the house?
How did I get into my bed?
WE got it back that's all.
How did the car get back here?
I feel so bad.
They all knew you at that place.
No you should forget about last night.
Is there something I should remember?
I'm your best friend.
And you're not coming.
Do you want to talk?
I am your friend...
I hate it...
I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Yes that's what I want.
I just want a friend.
Just one friend for just one minute...
What do you want me to call you?
Okay I suppose I should go home.
James is the one.
You know I think you're right.
No and yes.
I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
He probably wanted to drive over.
James called me last night looking for you.
Tell me right before the test.
You remember the...
look in here.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.
What about James?
You two are so in love.
I hate him I hate it.
Sometimes I love it.
But now I'm afraid.
I am so afraid.
He wants to be me...
He's the only one who could know where it was.
He's getting to know me now.
That's real.
Who would do that?
Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow.
Did you make me a tape?
I told you not to call me here.
Let's go all the way.
We're on our way Baby.
Right on time baby.
She asked about my father?
She called me.
I am the Great Went.
Baby you know why?
Open your eyes James.
It's just me now.
You want to see...
Let's get lost together.
Say anything you want...
I know you love me and I love you.
Everything but everything.
What is wrong with us?...
We have everything.
You know it and I know it.
There's no place left to go is there James?
What about tonight?
I've got to see you.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
We were supposed to be together.
You were supposed to show up.
We were supposed to get together.
I'm gone...
It does matter.
We're in love.
Yes I love you.
You'd think so.
We throw away the whole head.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong it's just the way I feel.
What people think?
It's a school night...
back by nine.
Where's Dad?
Sure you do it's good for you.
Did you take it again?
You can tell me anything.
I'll understand.
Where did you go?
What were you doing in my room?
I found them upstairs on your bed.
Can I take the car?
I always thought you knew it was me.
Stay away from me.
What's wrong this morning?
I was down the street.
You know I did come home come to think of it on Thursday.
Oh I thought I saw you.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Are you sure you're okay?
what is this world coming to?
Just sit here for a moment.
We're late to get to your mother.
Have you met him?
Have I met him?
A special friend?
A friend from school.
school's fine...
So you can talk to them.
And look at this.
I'm late for work...
There is no easy way.
Come back as soon as you can.
Yeah sure take a look around.
There's no one here anyway.
She asked me to do the run today.
Should I do it?
As far as we know nothing.
What did he find?
I know that answer.
But let's keep the price down.
So what I want to do is stop it here.
I want to do it myself.
I want it to come from me.
He's looking for small change.
tell me about this case.
Four cases in three years...
Since then he's been on his own.
He lost them all.
We have been paid to look the other way.
I came in here to take your money.
So I could get your money.
If I take it.
If I take that money I'm lost.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
It would be.
Two Hundred Ten Thousand.
That would mean I keep seventy.
You thought it was just.
We thought it was just.
nothing can make the woman well...
It means a lot of money.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
You know what that would mean?
It looks that way.
You meet him at the hospital.
Get her on the phone...
And he told me to change the form.
He told me to change the one to a nine.
Or else or else he said...
He said he'd fire me.
He said I'd never work again...
Who were these men...?
And why please tell us would you think that?
I thought I would need it.
This is a...
I have it right here.
And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
They wanted to clear their names.
Then please which is correct?
No less important than that which you took today.
You would not...?
Do you indeed.
We'll save the court the time.
When a thing is wrong...
as in this case I am available.
Yes we've heard that.
You you're available for that?
When you're paid to be there?
I'm on the staff of...
I am seventy-four years old.
What book is that?
Through through his book.
I know of him.
No I am not.
It's quite common in New York State...
Just as you are Sir...
For a price.
You're being paid to be here today?
almost nine minutes...
one moment Mr.
I agree with them.
For today only.
As long as you understand that.
It's got to be that way.
My God we tried to save her...
to save her and to save the baby.
We did everything we could...
And what did your team do...
Tell me one?
Well many reasons actually...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Anything special about the case?
Were you not?
I was one of a group of...
I was her doctor.
You were her doctor.
They took it back.
What you thought!?
What you thought...
Me and my wife...
You know what you did?
Do you know what you did?
Hold on a second.
Who do you think you are...?
I completely understand...
I was telling your wife we have a very good case here.
that's all right.
I told your wife.
I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.
I'm afraid that's not true.
Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No you did fine.
That is why she's in the state she's in today.
There's nothing they can do to me.
What difference would...
I'm putting you up at my...
From what I've seen Mr.
It was good of you to meet...
It's by no means bad I...
She getting good care over there?
Men who are known not only in this city but the world were trying to save a woman's life.
They were there and here you are four years later read some hospital report and say...
I am on the staff of...
Is that what a good doctor would do?
How old are you please?
that's what the sister said.
But that was not the case.
the type you gave her...
And you wrote that...
To do right.
the case with anyone.
We have to...
I thought that you wanted to do something.
I know who they were.
I'm sorry...?
I read the hospital report on your client.
Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
A single hour.
What did you do stop?
You're really...
You're great with these kids.
How old is he?
Are you done?
You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.
No no you listen to me.
I said the hell with it.
The hell with it.
My client do you understand?
Now this is it today.
I'd just like to get to the point Mr.
Answer the question Mr.
I believe that's the law...
is it not Mr.
Do we have time this morning to...
You know better.
That's it...?
life is too short...
and that's a lot of money...
You follow me?
See my point?
Let's talk a minute.
I was held up.
Call the A.
We've all got to let go.
What would you like it to be to me...?
What is that to you...?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You told me so.
You came to the wrong place.
It probably is.
You do what you want.
You want to leave...
do you want me to leave?
Well then what are you doing here?
And it's over...?
That's not the question.
If I'd...
if I'd...
I never should have taken it.
You get in bed.
I'll stay here with you.
I've got to work.
No no I'm just...
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work...
and is that serious?
I have some work to do...
Is this a bad time.
Would you like me to leave...?
Is this a bad time --?
Maybe I can do something right.
That's the point...
is that they might...
I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.
I think I will.
You just got lucky.
And I'll take your word for it.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Oh actually it was.
Then why'd you call it off?
It was actually.
How wonderful for you.
And what are you?
I changed my life today.
Look call me Monday hey?
Yes we know that you do.
We get it at work.
Would you would you call him up.
I'll give you my number and ask him...
I'm sorry Sir we're not allowed...
Could you give me his home number?
Business hours are over Sir.
Well maybe you better do that then.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
And ask me what?
I can get you up there on the stand.
I've got nothing to say to you.
It's just a matter of how big...
Why do you need me?
What went on in there?
That's what we'd like to know.
And you know what it was.
I'll just take a minute.
They they present their side and I get the same chance.
This is our chance to get away.
and they called him up and said to come out.
He's only trying to do what's right.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West...
You know how beautiful she was?
Her husband left her and he took her kids...
They'd take her in.
They'd take her.
You saw her?
But what can we do?
I'm sure you do...
It's not a good case.
It's a very good case.
He'll be back in a week...
I have to talk to him.
If I can only call him...
If I can call him...
He's not in Sir.
We had a meeting...
Well well well.
I want to buy you a drink.
Have you been in this bar?
Buy yourself one too.
Come on we'll get a cup of coffee...
What are you doing in New York...?
We got to talk.
four years ago...
How old are you how many children...
when did you last eat...
What did she do?
What difference can that make...?
Read me what she said.
I think we tried that.
The case is over.
Today is Tuesday.
Oh shit what's today?
What I'm saying they're getting some help.
The best is yet to come.
I tried her at the hospital.
I'm getting it back.
I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I had a good teacher.
' Can you get out tomorrow?
I saw them walk on water...
We've got her sister.
This is the point.
Who have we got?
I have to try this case.
I've got to stand up for that girl.
Will you help me...?
But you go call 'em back.
I have to stand up for her...
he's a good man...?
he's a good man...
I know what I said but not now.
You won it.
When they give you the money that means that you won.
Let them buy it.
We let them buy the case.
That's what I took it for.
And they're trying to buy it...
To do what...?
To help her to do what?
You need my help...?
Are you out of your mind...?
now who is that...?
What the hell do you think you're doing...?
or is she in town?
Is she in town...?
In New York?
I just saw her.
She told me.
I what are you talking about?
I talked to her this morning and she said...
What happened in those three minutes...?
What happened in those three...
they start again three minutes earlier...
As I've said we had some more...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.
We we were rather busy...
Yes that's correct.
You like that story?
The Big Boy did...?
So far you're great.
How'm I doing so far?
Come on out!
We're friends!
Hey there - open up!
Hey how about that!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!....
We might's well go home.
We'll clear the area all around.
After that we'll hit them all over the world.
Now there's no choice.
All right - I've seen enough!
Anything from them yet?
Nothing more coming through.
But I think I know where she'll be....
There was a girl with them...
If I could find her....
We had a chance...
We could have stopped them!
There's nobody left around here now.
You'll be all right with us....
for as long as anybody's got!
Here this way...!
I've got to get a look at them.
one of them!
Nothing there now.
You're not the kind.
You've been up all night.
But you want to know something?
I feel like I did one time when I was small.
They found me in a church.
I was afraid to go in any place else.
I've been as close to them as anyone.
Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I come from a big one.
Nine of us.
It looks so good....
Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
It's gone now.
And there they are!
You'll hit something!
Would you like some coffee General?
Good to see you General.
I just told them the local situation.
How does it happen cars are running?
They've all stopped at the same time.
When I want to look at something close...
I take them off.
But I am happy to meet you anyway.
I do know him...
You've got to rate to get that!
Why sure -- I got it!
Did it do you any good?
You seem to know a lot about him.
Oh - there were three of us.
Did you see it come down?
Is that it over there?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I'll get them!
I thought you had them.
The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
It might give us something.
Thought you might be interested...
There's one - there's the other and we're right between them!
Others follow later.
We will sir!
Radio is out.
That's their position?
I've done about all I can do here.
You go back in.
They probably saw it come down.
I'll let 'em know...
What's it look like?
I think somebody ought to check on it.
We're getting this under control.
to number three..
Number three to.
They'll understand us all right!
What'll we say to 'em?
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
How would I know...!
Must be somebody in there.
And since you've been thinking of making it.
Has anything funny happened?
A couple months.
We'll work something out.
I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
You rate right up there.
I've got other things happening.
You mean that was a...
Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Can I read it?
You should be too.
He's got this idea.
I'll be there in three hours.
Answer me did you get another call from that guy or not?
He's had some sort of...
Back before you know it.
Just be careful okay?
You want me not to go on this job?
It was nothing.
You were almost...
You were even cut.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.
Every once in a while we get a few.
He thinks I've gone home...
DO you mind...
Everything is not fine!
We took him.
Believe me everything is fine.
He was just here!
I suggest you go home and get some rest.
Your son is fine.
Get her back!
I've got to go in!
It happened just fifteen minutes ago.
You must've felt it.
What did you say you cut yourself on?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Read me some?
It's a story.
Coming for you...
The bad man's getting awful close.
Home that's right.
Why does God let there be bad things?
You just have to...
Trying to get up...
trying to get into our world.
what's the man doing?
the mean man...
In my bed.
What're you doing out of bed?
He's on his way.
Say how they find their way back home.
I like this story.
Someone's coming.
Just for a few hours.
When do you think it'll be done?
how'd you know?
That's the last thing you need right now I'm sure.
He's started again.
You doing okay?
Everything went great I thought.
Will you please just look for him around the hospital?
Will you help me John?
Do you have any idea what time it is?
I've never mentioned it to him.
It's in my family you know.
Seemed not was.
And it seemed absolutely real.
You'll see everything's fine.
I want to see for myself.
I want to see the body.
The car's no there yet?
Just give them the time he called.
Little one but...
What kind of choice?
But when that time comes...
How can we stop him?
So to get out he has to come through you.
Then what is he doing?
That's what I'm writing.
In the story.
They're about this...
Whatever you want to call it.
I'm working in television now.
The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Coffee'd be nice.
Can I get you something to drink?
Just take a minute.
No time like the present.
The car will bring you.
Well he better learn to own it.
They've become what you wanted.
That's why he came.
You may not like what you hear.
I am about this.
You miss him.
Looks like weather.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Did we lose anybody?
She said ""None the better you all go to hell...
North north-east.
ON THE DOUBLE!!
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Well that's all part of it.
It's your job to know.
George will show you what to do.
How old are you son?
There's still a way.
You came back.
Look meet us out front when you're through.
I feel like...
we can do anything.
You know I never had friends like this.
I'll tell you who you are.
Who I am outside of this boat.
What the hell I'm doing here.
It's what they expect.
Yes you could.
This is all you.
It's a ninety-one!
How'd you do.
I walked in on my parents one time.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
I'm just not like you.
Or are you just having a last look?
Like you really care.
Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Yeah but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Hey shut up will ya?
That is the point...
But that's not the point...
Look there's nothing they can do to me right?
We all have problems.
Listen man I think I have a problem.
Sorry to here it.
I know you will.
Look I just better go.
Jesus you never told them?
That's how he died you know.
Only good advice he ever gave me.
You'll be out of it.
It was so real...
Where are you from any way?
That's why they sent me here.
They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
I said ""Sorry wrong room"" and walked away.
Come on man what'd they look like?
Who wants to know?
But it's not is it?
I feel like I got you into this.
I just brought you something to eat.
You should tell him.
That's something he can take with him.
What right did then have to show up here?
It's his father sir.
We've all seen it...
Close the door.
The fact is...
we all have to face it.
Speak up boy!
I want to know that you've heard and understand.
We'll have to take him with us.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
What is it we can do for you today?
Well you never can tell these days can you?
And of course we are.
He's a big boy.
We'll do our best.
Take good care of my son.
This was his mother's idea.
As you can see there's a lot to do.
I'll be in in a minute.
Look what do you want?
Look it's me okay?
Well what does it have to do with?
It has nothing to do with him.
Look you put me on this boat in the first place.
Eat it anyway.
They'll know about it in the morning.
That's being sixteen too.
And being sixteen.
We're short one long boat too.
You're officer of the watch George.
What's happening?!!
It's all my responsibility.
We'll get along that way.
We've got to bring them together.
What the hell happened to him.
Everything is under control.
We'll think of something.
Will you shut up?
Oh Jesus oh Jesus.
I tried to tell you.
You made me come!!
They tell you that?
I've seen 'em.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I'll read it.
Read on young John.
If it were only that simple my young friend.
What is it...
You know what he is talking about here?
Look save it for somebody else will ya.
We've got a problem.
Might get interesting.
What's wrong Mr.
It's just a fish.
Let's just talk about it.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
What are we supposed to talk about?
How long you been standing there?
You already have.
Now go on.
Bill find Mr.
Do you have something to say?
You're a day late.
Hate it away.
Do it right now!!
Look in my eyes!
We'll do it together.
Up you go.
Lost everyone on board.
In fair weather no less.
Do you think this is funny?
You lost six people out there.
They are much more than that sir.
What makes you so sure it was one?
Then what are you trying to say then?
Turn it in we forget the whole thing.
May I ask you something?
Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
What's that supposed to mean?!
Easy for you to say.
I'm fine thank you.
I've never felt better.
But of course I know exactly where they are.
This be it?
Then I'll leave...
Say it - Say it - Say it...
Can I use your head there?
Hey pretty woman...
Take one of these.
She's my girl...
That bother you?
Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
You had enough?
You in or out on this deal?
Talked to her this afternoon...
While you was out.
Need me a good boy for back-up.
Then you're a member...
Thought you said this was a private club.
We was just there.
Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
This your car?
Come on I'll drive.
You been there yet?
Need a hand?
I'm from all over.
or after a hold-up...
No of course.
Told ya I would.
What's the name of it?
Got enough thanks.
Anything like that around here?
Was real nice to see.
Can I help ya?
Set one up.
How are you my man.
has always been a good town to sit around in.
Or Takes-us as they say in these parts.
He wants to take Mr.
Only if necessary of course and only in my own country.
But I am also with the government.
Oh many things...
You seen it.
So I used the.
I'm seventy-six was only seventy- three then.
Bet you've heard of me.
You love her...
are you in on this?...
The same to you.
Yes that's so.
Here on business.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
That's the past...
Hell no baby...
Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight?
We've got to find them kids.
Who was that?...
Who know's your here?
No you wait right there for me...
and I'll tell you then.
so they left the city.
Try to take it easy.
I want what's best for her too - like I said I'll do what I can to bring her home.
You ought to know just exactly what happened.
You remember that night...
Sit back a minute.
Now look what you made me do.
How'll he know what we look like?
What makes sense is all.
That's your son in there.
You two go on.
You must be my son.
If you live to.
I mean tomorrow.
Let's leave here.
So where'd you say you was?
Where'd you go?
Love you too.
I'll come along.
Come sit by me.
A little I think...
You find any work?
Not quite as bad as the weather though...
She died right in front of me.
I'm afraid she is baby.
Looks like clothes.
How'd you know my daddy?
That's the night my daddy died.
I sure did...
You knew my daddy?
Well there's a good side as well as a bad side to it...
I tried to tell you this before...
Sure is a big deal round here...
Some things you wish you could forget...
I hate to tell ya.
I MEAN IT!!
Give you a chance to rest.
We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
See if we can get some work?
Under a hundred.
Leave me be for a minute?
Come on and get up and we'll take off.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay.
That we're okay.
You think she's pretty?
What you make of that?
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music.
We could ask someone.
Makes no difference anyway...
Do you think he saw us?
Who knows baby?
You think he saw us?
Never mind where...
Sometimes not by half.
Oh baby what an idea.
I'd always be happy to see you no matter what.
' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
What was this one?
You think so baby?
Long as you got the other?
Just talked is all.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
I know that night by heart.
I think it's the best night of my life.
You get right on me.
How they used to do it.
Yeah well listen to this...
Come look at this.
How about that one?
I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Thank the Lord.
What do you mean by necessary?
What'd she do?
That's just what she said.
What a bad boy you are!
Told her my name.
What'd you say to her?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you baby...
You up for that?
Yeah I suppose.
He's twenty-four now?
A year older than you?
"" Nobody's seen him since.
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.
Six months ago.
I just think about things as they come up.
And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Twenty-three months eighteen days is all.
What you have to get personal about so quick?
All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
Here she goes again...
And another thing baby...
And he never did anything else to me.
And you never told nobody about it?
We did it there on an old bed.
No he picked me up.
Right there in the kitchen?
He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away.
Did I ever tell you how he died?
When I got old enough to buy my own I bought those.
The rest of you too of course.
What if I told you not to?
What if I asked you not to?
Call me again soon?
That's why I called to let you know.
I love you baby.
I just want you to be all right.
Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you.
How could you do that?
Just a place.
I can hear music behind you.
I need you here.
Why how could I not worry?
Are you with that boy?
I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
That's the last thing we need...
I'm afraid his car is gone Mrs.
You're my girl now...
I'll look after her now...
That's just another part of the price to pay.
I knew you had it all under control.
What little I'm sure he has.
But where in the head?
Now I'm beginning to get it...
In the head.
That's your business...
As simple as that.
You need to explain it.
Just tell me what you want.
How would I do that?
Get rid of him.
Get rid of him?
You know what take care of him means.
What does take care of him mean?
Take care of him?
What do you want me to do about it?
Have it your way...
But you want it.
Oh yeah - sure...
That's not why I called.
I knew you'd want it again...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire...
Yes you heard me...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Is there a contract?...
But I did...
And I told you all about it...
Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
You heard right.
I really need to know.
I'll tell you the problem.
There's your fucking problem.
He's right you look horrible.
Oh well that's just it.
She's been coming down here every half hour or so to sort of check on me.
If I'm not here she might...
call the police or...
He's great.
I like what you've done with it.
Only we might not make it in time.
No one your age just wants to go home.
You're good at that.
In a sense.
You'll be all right then.
We just made it up.
In fact we made the whole guy up.
We find the car...
Want some help with that?
Exactly how do we do that?
So -- what do we do now?
I've got to.
I think they'll let me.
There is no problem.
Did I say there was a problem?
Shut up James.
I know that's always been real important to you.
Okay check this out...
That's why we're here.
How are we supposed to find his?
Plenty I'm sure.
But for what it's worth...
What's to tell?
How bad is it for you?
Only one problem.
Does James have any friends.
You stay there.
Go out the other way.
Just go around him.
He heard everything we were saying.
Shut up and drink.
did something stupid tonight.
I'm not even sure if he's --
Is he any good?
He has a book.
Oh I'm sure you'll find another.
I lost a wife today.
I thought you were Mrs.
I mean what are we doing here?
She left me.
He said something about being between things.
Forget I asked.
I get pressure.
I just mean...
Think that might be possible?
I'm just sort of...
Well then shall we?
I'll be...
I have to see her.
As soon as possible.
So is my friend...
Actually it was her husband's dog...
Her dog yes.
She told you about...
You need to see a doctor Mr.
You're lucky she came along when she did.
And your wife left you.
I've been trying to finish a book...
That's probably not the problem then.
Any major changes recently?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been having them?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...
Boy or girl?
Who the hell is that?
Actually I'm wrong.
But that's not why I called...
Thank God you're there.
Well let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Does she mean -- does she know about...
I'm fine right.
And we both thank you for that but we're...
Ah wear whatever you want.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again.
I'm sorry about all that.
My parents left it to me.
Five or six years ago.
They're not my parents.
My parents are dead.
James like it or not they're your parents.
That's why I need you to go home.
You just sit here and...
You just worry about yourself James.
When nobody's looking.
What would you call them then?
That's why you're having them.
Get us a table.
Not to anybody.
My wife had left me.
But last night...
""Is he any good?
"" I heard you myself.
You said so yourself.
The hell I am.
So why did you take me up there?
' So you did.
Well let's try not to think about that.
She came here.
We'll just wait.
The one that left you?
Unless I miss my bet...
And what's here?
This is so nice.
What's it called again?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
And he should know.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
My parents live in a small town.
It's my father.
He gets it from his doctor.
I've got a thing about places like this.
I know what those houses are like.
I know what the people are like.
Yeah well actually...
She seemed to take it pretty well.
What do you think's the matter with you?
Jesus James you should've told someone.
A couple weeks.
That's why...
The bus station.
There is but it's not that interesting.
I was asked to leave.
Well done James.
and before that.
Did I do anything?
No one seems to know where you live James.
How did I get here last night?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
That's a big book you're writing.
What'd you tell him?
The guy on the phone.
Want me to get that?
I just write in it.
I put you on the floor.
I'm fine without them.
our old friend Mr.
Most of the time he is James.
Now what do we have here?
Can I ask you something about her?
He's dead James.
Believe me I know a dead dog when I see one.
I think we should go now.
It just looks...
So I'm told.
That's really it.
This is worth it.
I'll miss my bus.
There's something I think you ought to see.
So I thought...
I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it.
So what are you doing out here?
You cold James?
It only took me an hour to write.
Listen James about this afternoon.
It's not bad.
Sounds like a good one.
She's in it too.
I'm not her father.
It was my mother's.
No it's not that it's...
to your book.
I need the street.
Where did you take James that day?
The one in your office?
Take him to my place.
Last time I saw it was...
James is odd.
He said she worked there.
But I've never seen it.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
When you get him home...
make sure he's all right.
Before you leave.
The answer's yes.
Where are they exactly?
By the way his friend...?
And his friend.
Thanks for that.
I know but sometimes...
In the hospital.
Did you just make that up?
Does he still love you?
And you're old.
I lost it all.
Did you lose it all?
Did that nice doctor let you out?
And what did you say?
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
And what do you think you might have said?
I think I might have.
It's all my --
I tried to call but apparently there's something wrong...
What's he doing out there?
Who's that sitting in your car?
About the baby.
I believe you want to be with me.
Well actually yes.
Oh well that's part of what I need to...
Listen about last night.
There is something I need to tell...
A lot was happening this morning.
for saying there's just no way.
And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
There's no way.
Not have it.
to not have this baby.
And you need to stay with her.
Want to sit up?
Is the thing -- is it over?
First thing Monday morning.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
She's left the room before.
She always came back.
She's left before...
I'd better show you.
I need to talk to you too.
What she's standing under.
Is that what he told you?
He's writing his name in water.
I should've known better.
Now that I'm home.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I'm your man.
It's Mrs.
It was all so interesting.
I'm in love with her.
I'm in love with your wife.
That's not right is it?
Only when I'm working.
Taking the long way home.
Who's that guy?
Yeah that's true.
How the hell should I know?
It might be...
Is it good?
I want you to know that.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Where you stand?
want to know where I stand.
Maybe I should read it.
It's a young man's book.
I was thinking of you.
What made you pull out that old thing?
One other thing.
No the dog.
What happened anyway?
You mean like --
There was one guy.
In a car.
Just a few then.
The big ones.
There's so many...
If he's happy...
You want to keep him happy.
Ask me anything.
Why she do that?
I'm just saying I understand.
I'm just talking man.
Maybe I'm not a good man.
She needs to see you and you need to see her.
The week after?
I've got some good news.
Ah come on.
Want to see?
It was great man.
The birthday party.
How was the party?
I know man.
I love this table too.
But I also love my wife.
I put a lot of love into it.
I thought you might like it.
You need a table.
It was a beautiful present.
It's really nice.
It's a nice table.
She'll be twelve next week.
Wish I could ask you to come...
When can I see her?
She's good...
Make a bet?
One hundred and twenty feet.
I was just thinking of...
Hey is that a school?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
You tell me your name I'll tell you mine.
not in the common way.
I'm not pretty.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
What are you writing in that book?
See anything interesting?
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Do you come here often?
Were you watching me?
Not too far.
I'd love to hear it.
I bet you can.
I like that one.
It's just a city park.
It's why I like coming here.
You always carry these?
The mother sure has her hands full.
You want to see?
I'd say you're moving.
Probably not too many men fit that bill.
I went to bed around seven.
You said last night.
I went to bed pretty early.
You know anything about that?
I'll be asking the questions.
You knew her?
Do you believe in them?
Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.
Or what's left of it.
You walked home.
Too much sun.
Like a piece of shit?
In my eyes you are a piece of shit.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
If you could you would have brought one today.
You are in.
But you are taking it?
People have the right to know.
The new man.
I'd keep away from him if I were you.
I'd keep away from him.
You should go home.
it's just something I know.
Your daddy will always love you.
But will he...
Someone will talk to your daddy.
And then he'll stop doing those things...
What will happen if I do?
But you did.
Would you like me to take you there?
Thank you all the same.
A long time ago I was sent far away.
When they let me come back all my friends were gone.
Do you have many friends?
I will be in three months.
I hate being eleven.
I'm twelve.
Can I ask how old you are?
if she will ever...
I just hope...
I just want her to...
A small house...
It was a small house.
When the two of you held each other.
When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine.
I meant later...
I was six years old!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!
I'm only asking questions.
Did you take off her clothes?
Did you take off your clothes?
I want you back in your chair!
What the hell are you doing there?
Kids do that.
And what are you doing?
I'm maybe about six...
which would make her four.
We're little kids.
How old are you and your sister?
In my bed too.
I see my sister.
Can I open my eyes?
I'm all yours.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
That's my answer.
You mean my problem?
When did it all start?
I said I was sorry.
You're very late.
Now I know.
It's when I can see a girl be near a girl even talk to a girl...
and walk away.
That's my idea of being normal.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of ""normal"" was?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
I want to talk about it now.
Of course it is!
That's why I'm telling you!
Is this the first one?
What did you want to happen?
What did you think would happen?
I want to be normal!
What is your idea of being normal?
They usually tell me.
Do you know what ""normal"" is?
Will I ever be normal?
We have a lot of work to do.
I mean when will I be normal.
We have a few more minutes.
Why do you think you're here?
If I'm not then what the hell am I doing here?
I'm not afraid.
What are you afraid will happen?
Have to talk about something.
Then why are you talking about this?
She was born after they put me away.
Maybe it's the way I look.
That's an honest answer.
I wish you'd give it a try.
I'm still thinking about it.
Then think about it.
It's very good indeed.
It was just an idea.
No need to call me doctor.
I'm not running for Mr.
That's right you did.
Have you made any friends there?
I said the job is okay.
Do I take ""okay"" to mean you feel good about working there?
The job's okay.
And how's your job?
Do you want to talk about it?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
That's not what I meant.
I've got problems.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
It's a bad idea.
Move in with me.
We should live together.
Us seeing each other.
You never asked them about it?
I love all of them.
Which brother did this?
Why not tell me now?
Well most people are stupid.
For men like me.
They say most of us end up back...
Being here with me.
And what do you tell yourself now?
That's what I used to tell myself.
I've changed.
Sounds like a special guy.
I did those things.
No one else did.
You think time you feel time you hear time.
Hey I'm not --
Or do you get off on this shit?
Between ten and twelve.
Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven.
Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve.
I always asked how old they were.
What did you do to them?
Look you can go now.
Did I say something wrong?
I thought I'd stay the night.
How about in the morning.
It's been a while since...
You think I have a problem?
You're still here.
Hey that was...
Something happened to you.
Yeah they could.
They could eat you.
You must hate it.
Is that a school?
You should buy several.
Light's important but it's not everything.
People without cars.
I'm talking about you.
There's something wrong with this picture.
She went front-office on you.
It was alright for a while you know.
Okay good reason.
we're living together.
So there you were--
Where're you?
Do you read over?
You got it?!
Now you know exactly as much as I do.
You stay right here.
I have to go there to the end...
you'll see my lights.
Five more minutes.
I'm okay now.
I'm taking you back out.
They're all dead.
some of them...
Hey you okay?
Okay so far.
That new company man.
Next time it's your turn okay?
You're never wrong are you?
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
will you listen to me for a second!?
So I got a plan...
You got it on keep it on.
Alright put this on.
not enough time.
Time I get back you'll be--
But we better come up with something.
You see where it's coming in?
They'll come out after us.
There's some light from somewhere...
Well that's that.
Not in this thing.
You did okay back there.
Wait a second--
We all see what we want to see...
You know me better than anybody in the world.
I saw these things.
It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I saw something!
I'm just trying to hold this situation together.
I'm telling you what is there.
There's something down there.
look this is the little one right here.
Talk to me...
But you think it's something else.
One of ours?
Look forget it.
Video or anything?
It was just that simple.
You should get your own show...
I'll tell you what happened...
It's not part of you life any more.
So what about ""Michael"" then...
You still seeing him?
Do you always have to call him that?
His name is Michael.
Oh yeah right...
and you only had three years with me.
No I think you were.
That must be it.
What would have you done?
Not even when it meant something.
You never did like being called that did you?
They bought you...
I'm not interested in your way of doing things.
we have a certain way of doing things here.
Look it's three AM.
it looks right.
Is this right?
You got all that?
you see his hands?
Why bring it here?
Yeah for now.
Do we just leave him there?
No I mean it.
go on to...
We're here now.
Let's get her done.
We should be dead.
Some place that has similar conditions...
You better not say you missed that.
You watch yourself.
Okay here we go.
Give me that!!
Hey no really!
I just need to know that this thing is out of here!
How many are there?
Just hold your water okay?
Let's go for it.
We could get lucky.
Although that works too...
Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here man.
Better you than me know what I mean?
We just got them.
Through three miles of water?
What kind of light?
He can still make it.
Talk to him.
Keep him with us.
There you go...
And what about yesterday...
at my house...
And I feel awful.
But you just said that a month was too...
It's not enough...
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.
That way we'll have more time...
But I think we should talk about it.
A little more so this time.
You'll get over it soon.
A month is too long a time.
I have become used to being without you.
Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
I'd like to try...
What a question...
Then how come you're not with him?
When do you have to go back?
She'll wait.
Which one shall I wear?
Yes fairly well.
But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things...
After giving us such a run around...
You know I could just as well go without seeing him today.
It's the same thing.
You already know what they are.
But how could you say such a thing?
Oh very well.
I should be used to it by now.
Four or five days.
And how long will you be away?
Well as a matter of fact I was right...
The woman was found two days later.
I understand very well.
But you must understand sir that I...
In other words something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what...
But how could we...
at a time like this when we just...
Could be that something might turn up there.
It's the first time that ever happened.
It's already two hours...
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Somebody must live here!
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Have you decided?
What is that one over there called?
Tell me once more.
Tell me that you love me.
Good night my love.
Late very late.
What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Who knows where he is?
If we had to listen to everybody...
I want everything you do.
No reason why...
In a few minutes.
Then I'll see you later.
So you wonder why?
But you know it already.
Why must I tell you?
Yes yes yes yes...
That's a very lovely size.
That's why I asked you...
Are you really sure...
at a time like this...
Oh but why did you have to ask me?
You know I had many ideas...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times...
maybe even just before we left while I was waiting outside your place...
That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Then why do you say them?
Does it please you to say such things?
I feel so small...
I hate myself...
Who knows why they all left...
Move over there.
Let's make believe nothing happened.
And when we get to the next station, get off.
I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it...
It takes even less.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago...
My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But she's not...
And it's better to do it right now.
How can I make it clear to you?...
Why did you come?
But then when will we see each other?
Yes, you should go.
Have you read it?...
Then I'll go with you.
Yes, maybe that is better.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Yes, very much so.
I'm sorry about last night.
nothing at all!
And how do you explain that?
And why do you tell us this only now?
Why, even this morning...
And that's what I say, too.
But of course...
How should I be...
Yes, you're right.
Go to your room and get back into bed.
We would have known.
I feel she's back, and that they're together.
More or less, we are all afraid.
He's not in his room.
It means being without money.
Actually, I'm used to it by now.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm not coming.
We went all over.
Shall we go out?
Have you ever been in love?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
He's really just a child.
if he wants me.
Please, do come...
But for what reason should I come there?
Please, you come too...
Who are you talking to?
We, too, you know.
How did you spend the night?...
And what did you have to eat?
I'll stay here also.
Does that please you?
Who's moving?
Then let's get started...
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun.
Now look here.
Look at this structure...
I think it's possible.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
I was saying...
We'll try again.
Yes yes of course.
And you expect to find him in here?
Nothing nothing  at all.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
You've never met my husband have you?
I know we are.
But as the years go by we become even worse.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you that's all.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
But why me?...
Oh there are as many as one wants.
He's eighteen years old the lucky boy.
What have you got to say about that?
What other boat?
Now we're getting somewhere!
And what about the other boat?
You need the money.
Now I can help you.
Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch...
My sister is sick...
and my father too.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home.
For me love comes first.
I'm a man and I know what's what: first love and then music.
Music of course.
But for you what comes first: music or love?
It's especially useful for...
No not like this one.
We have a radio like this too.
They told me that you were a very nice girl that you always mind your business...
In other words things of that sort.
And what did they say about me?
Yes she takes care of the garden.
And who is she?
Pleased to be of service any time.
And do you remember where she got off?
Is four in the morning early for you?
And how come you're up so early?
Just a moment ago...
But where did you come from?
Yes even I had a mother.
Oh no not at all.
Yes we will.
Then I'll meet you there.
But we'll do something.
He wants to send one of his men over to have a look...
One never knows...
I'm always here.
Unless you happen to love children.
But I already told you...
But after all what can you do...
Why have we stopped?
But right away tomorrow morning...
About fifty miles or so.
Is that far from here?
Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Why do you think she does all this?
But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Wait a moment.
I would like to ask you something.
Should you see a doctor?
It's not my time of month.
It's not that...
it's not that...
Then tell me.
Yes of God.
Oh my dear child.
I mean look at these.
That's not what he meant.
Through someone else?
He talked to you Himself?
Why is this?
what did she do?
It was dead.
It's alright to hate him.
It was God.
For what he made me go through.
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him...
Tell us who he is so we can find him.
Stop him from doing this to other women.
He did a terrible thing to you do you understand?
Stay away from me...
Let go of me I wish you were dead.
So she sent you?
She'd seen him too.
How did she know about him?
So I could go to him.
What did she mean?
She said Michael.
The night Sister Paul died.
Do you remember.
Do you feel well enough to stand?
Do you remember what just happened?
it's alright.
It's alright...
Is someone in the room with you?
it's all water...
I have to throw up...
For me to get sick in.
What do you think it's there for?
Do you know who put it there?
What do you you see something different?
I hate them.
What did you have for dinner?
I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Let's go to your room.
It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Would you like to tell me?
How did the baby get into you?
May I open my eyes now?
To be a mother?
Why were you afraid?
Did you want it to come out?
It came out of me.
How did you have a baby?
I had a baby.
But it's easy.
Of telling you.
Would you like to tell me why you're here?
To help me.
And why am I here?
Can you hear me.
I really love you.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Are you pretty?
what do you say?
How does she know that?
And that you're stupid?
take off my clothes and then...
You can tell me.
What did your mother do to you?
did she hit you?
What did she make you you do?
I'm always bad.
You never answer me.
If you go away then I'll forget.
What the child?
Is that what she said?
If you did want one how'd you go about getting one?
I could never be a mother.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
No but I can never tell her that.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Who told her?
Somebody told her.
How did she know that?
She knew things that nobody else knew.
There is nothing else.
Oh no place as wonderful as this.
Oh it's even more wonderful then.
No only when she felt like it.
What else did she tell you?
She was kind to me.
She told me I was beautiful.
Well I think they come from...
Before that I...
Do you have any more questions?
Would you like some?
Do you have any children?
Not at the moment no.
Would you like to be?
you ask and I'll answer.
Would you like to ask them?
Then let's talk about something else...
you want to talk about the baby...
everybody wants to talk about the baby but...
Yes I do  but I want you to...
Where'd it come from before that?
Is that where they say it came from...
The baby they made up.
Where did the baby come from?
I went to my room.
And what did you do?
How were you sick?
I was sick.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
I never saw any baby...
I think they made it up.
Would you like to talk about it?
Where do you meet?
And you like that?
when I look into his eyes I can tell.
He's told you?
Oh I know he does.
Well do you love...
Oh there are so many.
other than Jesus Christ?
Well who in particular?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
But there's nothing to say about God.
First thing that comes to your mind?
may I sit down?
What would you like to talk about.
I just heard you.
I've been asked to talk to you.
I've been watching.
As quickly as I see fit.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Jesus look at you.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
tomorrow I'll get it by tomorrow.
I can get you new evidence next week.
I'll have it.
It's gone on long enough.
I'll have a decision by next week.
All I want is one more week.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
He's free.
after all the things she said to me.
Not any more...
Shut up I'm trying to watch this.
brought you something.
The one up on the third floor?
Oh that one there in the corner.
Well that's a lot of land.
You must have help.
Do you have field hands that help you?
Oh we own the land around here.
Not many of us left...
Look Father ah...
What business is it of yours..?
Do you still go to church?
What does this have to do with..?
Well you're probably right about that.
What happened to the baby?
I left it with her and I went for help.
And the baby.
You wanted that child out of the way.
too late to stop it.
Too late for what?
Was it you?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Who was that person Mother?
I'm concerned about her health.
How could she find out about it?
Did you know about that?
There's an answer Mother.
That's how she got out.
You're thinking about her all the time.
That's what I have to believe...
That's what you believe she is?
One two three right down the line.
But I want the opportunity to believe.
I want the choice to believe.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But how did it happen?
You're saying God did it?
Why must he be anybody?
For the Church?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
we'll find our own thank you.
We're taking you off the case.
May I be present?
Would it stop you if I did?
Do you want to become one?
Oh you've come a long way baby.
And of course
I'd love one.
Would you like one?
She was the pretty one.
She died why not me?
And what has that to do with it?
She was a beautiful little girl.
and that's all?
What did we do?
So what did we do to you eh?
You just said...
I'd like yours too.
I knew that after the fact.
Oh God if only I'd known.
Oh dear God.
Do you know what she did to her?
I was needed in the sick room.
Oh Dear God...
Was the child full term?
Take at look at it.
Do you have a...
All right what do you need.
There's another choice.
What good would it do.
No matter what you decide it's either the...
Let her face the world.
Then help her.
She has a right to know that.
But you and your...
She is not a child.
Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm only interested...
Not simple no.
She has it now.
She had a...
About two years before.
When did you first learn about her...
Oh come on you've talked to her.
Well it's been known to happen in the day too.
I've already told you what I thought.
And in your eyes?
not in the eyes of the police.
So someone else could have done it.
She's never been out there Doctor.
She's never even read a book.
From other people!
what do you think?
I know what you are!
Well I'm the doctor.
Why do you think that?
Yes but that was some ten months ago.
Look someone gave her the baby.
Obviously there was.
Could there have been anyone else?
Yes but I...
None as far as I know.
Who was the father?
You can call me Sister.
Well I let...
Do go on...
Of course John.
you're bank.
What they like?
Are you now?
Well that's lovely talk that is.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Bet you're only eight and a half.
How old are you anyway?
The police station.
What about all these letters?
They'll be here.
Well that's it two minutes to the final run-through...
Please do I'll not need them for fifteen minutes.
We're nearly there sir.
I see you go to the night court.
Ever seen one of these before?
Oh yes now I'm with you.
we're doing a hundred now...
Well that's the wrong line for a start.
You never know you might be lucky this time.
Get him out of here.
Get him out of here!!
You'll have to love her.
Now you'll like these.
It'll be written out and you'll learn it.
Can he read?
Oh you can come off it with us.
Did you look in here?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
No straight up.
Hello I've got one...
oh I think so...
yes he can talk...
I think you ought to see him.
Of course right away.
Oh there you are!
I'll look in here again.
You're getting out of hand.
Should I say it?
He comes from a large family.
Eh there's only three of them.
Hello he's not talking to me.
Well what happened?
Oh aye but I thought...
Who's that little old man?
Aye it is but as long as you get by it's all right you know...
And what do you do about it?
How would you do those lines of mine?
When I'd done she said to me ""Go and give some to the other kids.
that's why you need other people...
I hate it when other people are let in.
We do you know.
I'm in a group...
They ought to be.
But that's not like a real person at all.
"" and all that.
Aye I knew you were.
I just felt like doing those lines.
Do you like the play?
is it really?
Oh it's the way you talk.
Are you supposed to be here?
What are they saying?
That's what they want you to think.
Oh they seem all right to me.
I'll get the boys.
Hold on son I'll be back for you.
Where are you off to?
You're only right.
what's in it for me?
And what's it all come to in the end?
you're as bad as the rest of them.
You're living are you?
Books are good!
Any old where...
but not our little Richard...
Can you now?
You learn more by getting out there and living.
You can learn from books.
what's the matter with that?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
What's he on about?
Is there a fire then?
I've never seen them before in my life!
That'll keep you busy.
Come on let's get this coffee.
And we're looking after him are we?
He can talk then?
Why do you always use your left hand?
I mean why do you do these things?
Oh well that's all right.
It's all taken care of.
It's down on our bill.
Oh no you're not.
You've gone too far this time...
and who's paying for all this?
Well what are we waiting for?
Where are your clothes?
Is that yours?
That's all right then.
No that's his other one.
What's old got to do with it?
He's done it son!
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through.
So's mine.
Let's have a little action.
Let's do something then.
Will you stop it!
Give 'em a pull.
Aye that's what I'm afraid of!
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Oh that one.
That little old man.
What little old man?
pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
No you look here John.
I've only one thing to say to you.
John I'm talking to you.
They're nearly ready for you.
I would though.
Sit down the lot of you.
Let's have you.
Aye well now!
Now get on with it.
Paul John George - get at it.
Look as soon as I tell you run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Is it really?
It's all over the place everyone knows.
What have you heard?
That's what you tell me.
Aye but you know him well.
I would have said so.
Oh you do look.
Oh do I?
You're the first one who ever said that.
Well you look like him.
I'm not no.
Oh you are I know you are.
No not me.
He'll get over it.
Since you ask yes.
Oh leave off!!!
It'll only get you into trouble.
I've got the stuff.
Aye I suppose so.
He can look after himself.
You've lost him.
Well look after him.
Look after him.
Someone put it on me.
What do you think are you're up to?
When I tell you to stay put stay put.
That's mine.
None for me then?
Ah well there you go.
as they head up for the show.
I know that's the trouble.
Well give a couple of minutes...
Yeah down the...
Oh down the...
He's been gone a long time.
I've a good mind to...
Well you stick to that story son.
Yeah you want to watch it.
I thought you were looking after the old man.
Oh he's gone to my club has he?
And they want me?
Course he can talk.
Oh anything you say Paul.
I'll set John on you!
Eh what's all this?
I've got a little list here.
You name it he's done it.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Or something will be able to see us.
Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
and let them deal with it.
Yeah it's you all right.
I feel like shit...
am I cold...
Yeah but this is hard work.
Yeah I'm okay.
Are you okay in there?
No I want to go in.
No it's too small only room enough for one person.
Can we come up?
You want to try?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
No you'll follow me.
I'll go first.
Close enough to walk to!
Then take her down.
I want to see what this place looks like.
Face it we're out of range.
Point eight six.
We can walk on it.
Computer what language was that?
Play it for us please.
What conditions are you talking about?
Where does that go?
What happened to the lights?
Where's it coming from?
Yes I know what they make it out of so what?
It's food now.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
You like this shit?
I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  ""...
Why what's wrong?
Talk to you.
Well get started.
What the Christ was that?
Boy do I feel a lot better.
Oh -- God -- oh --
And be right back.
I'll go get it.
Well we better do something.
It's clear.
I kind of like it.
Just hold us together till we're in space that's all!
Here let me try.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
And when will you be ready to do that?
It makes me sick to see him like that.
I never saw anything like that in my life...
Yeah but how?
Where did it come from?
well maybe he should have.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
It must have stopped moving.
I'm not getting anything.
It will be.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Let's get moving.
That's good!
There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
Does anybody know what happened?
We've got six hours left.
Got a better idea?
Can you do anything for him?
Well what the hell good can we do in here?
It must still be in here.
Now we're in for it.
The rest of you continue.
Should be coming through about there.
Hey now what is this?
Thanks for the thought.
I should hope so!
This should do it.
That's the only reason we came out here.
Is that what you mean?
It was horrible -- horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
what about the film?
This is horrible.
What's happening up here?
They're coming this way!
I've got 'em!
I think we should go after them.
Can you get them back?
Now what's wrong?
They're getting pretty close now.
They're on the next level up.
Are they close?
and something else as well in front of him.
We came out there we'll go back.
I thought I'd find you here.
And what do we do when we find it?
We've got about a week left right?
Maybe we could write it together.
God knows how long they've been here.
No thank God...
just missed him.
It's stopped?
Let's let the machine work on him.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Come on give me a hand let's get him out of there!
Oh God oh God no.
Can you see anything?
No it's coming.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Here's his line.
Sun will be down in a minute.
We should be almost on top of it.
It's close real close.
I've got it.
We do know that.
About four hours.
I feel like we've been here for days but it's only been how long?
This is an opportunity which may never come again.
I'll get you out of there.
What did it do to you?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Here carry these.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Can we get to him?
His body held it open.
Two down four to go.
Now we go in.
We're coming!
We've got it up here!
These will be very useful.
All right so that's what we've got.
It's plenty of time.
You bet we made it.
Take us up.
We can see what happened to him.
Would somebody fill me in?
I understand why you did that.
We lost you!
Listen there's been a new development --
Yeah we hear you!
We're coming back!
But why draw it on the wall?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
you know me.
Find anything we missed?
I'm getting you clear too.
Let's just keep the line open.
I've got you on my board.
Sorry but we are not home.
have some water?
Let's get back and call this in.
Bloody big if it is.
Top's open.
I told you we...
Yeah it's fine.
Well just keep looking.
believe me you know about it.
Get her on-line.
I found it...
How many of them are there?
We're what!?
It's on the board.
Okay give me the numbers.
No but I got something that might interest you.
About thirty minutes.
How much air-time have I got?
there's got to be a way out of this.
Has anybody talked to them?
It's too late!
Seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour.
No he's stopped; he's totally still.
Nice and easy...
Is it still moving?
Just behind us over to the right.
Hold it hold it...
Still got him?
Hey fair enough.
We can bag it no problem.
Just the two of us?
I know I put it up.
Next time you have a thought like that?
Keep it to yourself.
Listen to what?
One final point.
York just turned up outside.
We had to.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Okay I'm out of here!
Okay we're in business.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
There's still time to back-out.
It's not all good news.
Looks like it.
Already working on it.
What do we tell 'em?
Done it already.
That's what we thought.
You have to...
fit me in here.
remember what happened next.
That's the wrong way!
There's not much we can do out here.
'll throw a fit.
Real man' drink.
There's a lot of talk goes around.
And before that?
How long you been out here for now anyway?
Used to get it pretty bad.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.
wanted to be put on my own for a while.
Clear my head.
That was four months ago.
They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Where'd you leave them?
And what is your name?
How do you know my name?
Will you give it to her?
She asked me to see who it is...
It's for this.
Then say so.
No-no-no...
You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
I had to say something be somebody make her like me!
Answer my question!
It is true that your parents were poor.
They still are.
And they would like to know how you are - and where.
That you and I...
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years.
What have you got to do with it?
- it's important right now that we talk.
It's important that I-
You still do.
Well say something - anything!
There never was there'll never be another like you.
I want a run of the play contract.
You sat and talked until it was light...
we sat and talked until it was light.
He never went home...
We decided the night before last before we came up here...
You have no right to say such things!
But I do know you.
It's nothing of the kind!
When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
That's for tonight.
You know me better than that.
It'll be a night to remember.
It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted.
The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
To come and go...
Just like it.
To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Just like that eh?
Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
Heart to heart?
Woman to woman?
Nothing of the kind.
Just some coffee.
I believe I will.
I can wait.
Where would you like to go?
We'll make this a special night...
by the way what was your husband's name?
- perhaps more than one.
There's so much I want to know.
I've heard your story in bits and pieces...
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I'd love to!
I am somebody.
how would I do it?
I'm less than nobody.
You're more than kind.
That's all television is my dear.
Tell me this.
Go make him happy.
Go do yourself some good.
That's how you met me.
And you come sit by me.
All I want is a drink.
You have a point.
I'm giving her a very high-class party.
In my case it's necessary.
Answer me this.
She may be later than you think...
But she's just as late as the old one.
You were there?
At the play - last night?
Then you've heard too.
How nice for everybody.
In time she'll be what you are.
I take it she read well.
You were one.
Was she that bad?
Of course I knew.
It is now nearly four.
I've come to read with her.
She'll be all right once it starts.
Then you two must have a long talk-
We have that in common.
I do not.
everything's so funny...
We know you, we've seen you before like this.
Is it over - or just beginning?
A minute ago.
You've already met.
that's for me.
And no more make believe!
Off stage or on...
I mean it, now.
Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in...
and a man to go with it.
never have I been so happy.
But not tonight.
there they go.
I may find her...
I was good.
Then it comes up again and everything's fine.
But not this time.
Then what would be enough?
I wish it were.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did.
Were you listening to me?
Just being happy?
The terms are too high.
Come on get up.
I'll buy you a drink.
I've been aware of that for some time.
Now once and for all stop it!
That word again!
No I'll tell it to you!
For the last time I'll tell it to you.
Along with the rest of it...
What fire and music?
What's all over?
We'll put your name on it.
It'll say there.
As a matter of fact you're looking at it.
Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Thirty minutes forty minutes!
So young and so fair...
So she seems.
That never stopped you before.
I had no idea you were even here.
You've heard it.
To put me to bed?
It's a good thought.
Good night darling-
anyway I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
who'll I ask?
Happy birthday darling...
Bill it's your birthday.
When - when are you coming back?
That I am...
Call me when you get in...
As of this moment you're six years old...
And cut that out right now.
Take care of yourself out there...
I told her.
She's quite a girl that what's-her name...
here we go-
The world we live in...
Only in some ways.
Only thing what I go after I want to go after.
You're quite a girl.
- and for you.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
Then face it.
I'm for it.
What about off?
From what would I be running?
The names I've been called.
What have I got to do with it?
And what you want.
Is that what you want me to be?
If that's what you want to be.
To give so much for almost always so little...
Thanks for your help...
I think we'd like very much.
if you'd like.
So few come back...
It's only one picture deal.
I just asked a simple question.
Is it the money?
Why you have to go out there.
You said forty-seven minutes.
Hello what's your name?
She's on her way.
But she just got here...
And he's been here twenty minutes.
Late for what?
where's Bill?
What about the food?
My back's open.
Did the extra help get here?
You all put together?
I'll tell you how.
How do you mean that?
let's say she thinks only about you anyway...
She thinks only for me...
Night an' day.
She works hard.
Now you want an argument.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
See you home...
How do you do my dear.
The same size?
I'll get it...
That's the door.
It's after one now.
How long does it take?
Ours was one of the first.
I'm the president.
I've heard of them.
It was for my report.
You were just looking around...
She knows enough not to be here.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
A part in a play.
You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
it's quite a story.
you'd better sit down.
And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...
Over my dead body...
It could have been - fifteen years ago.
It's my part now.
After all you've said...
If you told him so he'd give me the part.
He said he would.
Something most important you can do.
I think I know...
Give yourself time.
and believe it or not if there's anything I can do-
Yes you will.
I'll never get over it.
More to yourself perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I wish I'd never met him I'd like him to be dead...
I want my friends back.
He can help you.
He's not my friend.
You were my friends...
Oh but there is-
I've got a lot to say.
And none of it is easy.
Just for a minute...
What we talked about before?
Well - if she's got to pick on someone I'd just as soon it was me.
Then - would you talk to Mr.
They'll do as they're told.
The show must go on.
but the other day - when I heard Mr.
Now who's show up at this hour?
Not just that way.
As a friend...
I hope I see you again soon-
I think I'd better.
If I only knew how...
You look just fine...
by the way.
But if I'd known...
maybe some other time...
I mean looking like this.
She's got to meet you-
You see the play?
I see the play.
He'll agree with you.
He's the best.
You and your husband are always with her - and Mr.
what's he like?
Why should you be?
I had to help out.
I found a job.
and I went to see it.
And - well - here I am...
Not at all...
There was just mum and dad - and me.
it started with the play before this one...
Let's get back to this one.
There was an item in the Times.
How'd hear about it?
How are you making out in Mr.
I had no idea you knew each other.
Is there anything else I can do?
If you'd like.
See you at tea time...
Oh come now as though you were an old lady...
Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I can imagine...
It looks better on you than it did on me.
They are lovely.
I made them myself.
Well you've done so much...
what's new?
You certainly can.
Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr.
It was the last week.
I went one night...
the most important night in my life - until this one.
Then when the show went East - I went East.
Did you see it here in New York?
Not with you in them.
Not by Mr.
But not right away?
But now I must.
It get better!
here listen to this- ""...
To so many things I want to be for Bill...
You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman.
Without that you're not woman.
Not to you.
Not to Bill.
I've seen it happen too often.
And what's left will be...
Why should he - and why should you?
More than anything in this world I love Bill.
And I want Bill.
I want him to want me.
He's in love with you.
What about Bill?
So many people - know me.
I wish I did.
I wish someone would tell be about me...
The way you do.
We know you too well...
Do you want it on?
He'll come back - with or without gas.
Three or four miles...
How far to the station?
How much time have we?
That little place just two hours form New York.
It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand.
I'm so happy you're happy.
She's just outside the door.
You've what?
I've brought her back to see you.
What she is what she's done?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Well of all-
You - for one.
Now just a minute!
Now just a minute-
No I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
I'm trying hard to follow you.
That's quite a change of subject.
I wonder why.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
Where'd you get all that information?
Five-fifty-five.
We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two.
It is now five forty-three.
When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Just the four of us.
She knows it.
That's the trouble.
Of course she knew!
And again and again!
Up to here!
That's where I've got it - up to here!
In a minute...
It's about time we did!
I'll make it up to you, believe me.
And a fine play.
You know she probably means well after all...
It's been quite a night.
It's not important whether you do.
I never said it was!
It's right to the point.
To you too?
I thought you knew...
She was put on over a week ago-
But I had no idea...
Just one person.
as young as they want you mean.
Three months ago I was forty years old.
"" She's - still a girl of twenty?
How's the new one coming?
When you do let me in on it.
Who's left out there?
Up in the room.
There you are both of you.
What is he talking about?
What has or is about to happen?
I like that girl.
Would you really?
That was way back...
Call what call?
Then this will be five.
I just played it.
But what could she do?
To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way...
All you got to do is name it.
A couple of weeks.
Well if she can act she might not be bad.
What's-her-name your sister...
And I got friends.
Not with a hit.
How about me what?
Maybe we are...
It's nothing personal though.
I think that's him.
God knows it worked.
You think we're being set up?
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?
I would have been.
What would you have done?
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Call him anyway.
--shit who do we know?
--I know I know--
That happens to people.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
Go on go on--
Did he just say what I think he said?
We understand your problem--
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us that's all.
What else do we know?
Anything you've got.
""  And I said ""Am I supposed to do that?
It was there.
For the paper no; for us plenty.
Christ and I even know somebody at the phone company--
--I'm trying--
The fucking New York Times.
About the past year.
--what do you think?
Were there others?
How would we find out?
You know anyone important?
All right what do we know?
I was sure trying.
They put us both on the break-in thing.
--read 'em both and you'll see--
--mine's better--
--what have you been here nine months?
--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--it was fine the way it was--
Morning or night?
--what time is it?
Sir I'd like to ask you a few--
Think it might be anything?
--yeah that was in The Times this morning.
we know about that.
I'll never get out of here in time.
Just tell him I was here that I'm sorry I missed him--
He is not in the car.
I told you he had to go out on a case.
He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
I'd really like to see Mr.
I'm still here.
Any idea what he did?
Sure--off the record.
But you know who did.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
By ""they"" you mean...?
We've just been talking to Young--
""  I'm still waiting for it.
--what about you?
Put him on.
--if he did it or just said he did it God knows.
--there's nothing new in it--
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Five hundred; six maybe.
Oh they're here.
They control everything; that's how they know it all.
Sometimes it looks that way.
and getting worse...
Who were they?
A lot of it was.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
never in so many words...
--right right I've got to go.
One minute but then--
Which is why you can talk to us.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid.
I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
You've really got to go.
Something maybe big.
What're you onto?
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--this'll only take one second--
I've been looking for a job but it's been...
I'm not thinking of myself.
What happens when the baby comes?
I will not talk about the other two.
But they both worked at the White House?
To cover up?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Try and understand this.
I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife.
Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
--they're worse.
--then again maybe things are even worse than we've written--
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Anything else from Mr.
--I'm sure--
--I saw him.
I have nothing more to say.
It was really nice of you to come since you'd only met him once.
--you have nothing more to say I understand that.
Whatever you want you'll have to get from him I have nothing more to say.
--I'm not here.
What do you mean, where?
you're definitely doing a story...?
The one with your name on it.
--this should take only a minute, Mr.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Yes, yes, everything.
There were more then.
--what were they after?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens?
--who told them not to?
How high up?
My turn to keep you waiting.
And he kept it there.
What I know you'll have to find out on your own.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
I did everything you said but it all seemed--
Always follow the money.
You come up with anything?
--yes yes what is it?
Could you tell me when you expect Mr.
Where in government?
Your name please.
Nobody ever had too much.
I really want to know.
I would if you really ever wanted to know.
You've never told anyone who he is?
But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.
But it's possible.
Would I know him?
It may never come out.
When will you be do you think?
Are we right on this story?
--well what if your boys get it wrong--
--who you got?
It's probably nothing but check it out.
go on go on...
--listen I love this country you think I want to bring it down?
He just did.
--well and good but when will he say it on the record.
What do you think Mrs.
--can we use their names?
What else have you got?
Of course--everything they asked--
No none of those.
A boy or a girl?
Does ""they"" mean the White House?
My wife told me to expect you.
The what to what?
--I already get the Post.
The rest of you okay with that?
Well then keep it coming.
Alright people good work!
It came from the heart.
No it was good.
There are just some things you need to learn that's all.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Behind the bar.
Oh no no date.
I'm so happy for you.
And where might your date be?
For the most part.
What do you suppose they're saying?
You know Jim...
you could go back there...
Whatever you hear about me you agree.
Well that's what your friends call you.
I feel like I'm one of your friends now...
No that's not what I mean.
I mean -- look.
You know what made me leave that game?
I'm not playing.
What about the game?!
it's okay you should do whatever makes you happy.
It's really important it's our last game.
And they're like ""You'll figure it out.
Well you're not.
Oh thank God I thought I was the only one.
I really have no idea.
Well State's got a good business school.
and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
my dad's the manager.
I mean really.
I needed to find you.
You better practice.
Give me a break you're so full of it.
No I like the car.
That was like a bad idea.
I think this'll be really good.
So I had this...
What's your middle name?
Hey what're you doing here?
well that's okay.
I was interested.
Well the same things you do.
Hang out with friends and stuff you know whatever.
I know what people think.
I mean I agree but...
you've got this sort of...
Not bad Chris.
I've never tried it.
Well that's a no.
I think I've had one.
I want the right place the right time the right moment.
We both have cars.
So he did and I did.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
It was my idea.
Well it's up to you.
If I say it I have to be sure I mean it.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.
But that one time --
I'm pretty sure I've --
Ah you'll get her back soon enough.
You're so big!
I do baby I do.
Oh yeah baby I'll give it to you.
Give it to me!
Yeah I'm the best baby.
Oh baby you're so good.
No no that's fine.
So you doing okay?
You afraid or something?
That answer your question?
Let this be it.
Come on Jim.
No you're stupid.
Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
But but -- what would I do?
Did I miss anything?!
Went home to shit.
No -- it's true.
Exactly three weeks to the day.
That gives us...
No money involved.
This is more important than any bet.
Like a bet?
Sorry I thought you were dead.
You know I've never got that shit.
So does my hair look better --  like this or...
You think she was serious?
And you said...
I'll let you hit those books.
This lady's here for you.
Sure you know son but I think you've been having a little problem with it.
It's okay though.
It's like practice.
Dad please stop.
I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
It's not what it looks like!
Thank you dad I got it.
Here's let me show you.
These are for you.
From father to son.
Dad come in.
You're a sure thing!
This'll do.
And then this one time?
Okay I get it.
So the end of the story is...
Well this one time?
Yeah bring it on!
You want a story?
Here's a story.
What was your name again?
I was at this --
Yeah that's pretty much it.
After high school.
I mean after this everything'll be different.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Oh and my date.
I still think you're okay.
Oh -- no way.
So let's say you get there...
I am now a man.
I've got...
I am sorry Jim.
No not again.
Did you see this?
No no I'm not done!
You are done James.
Do you not want to be with me?
No no you must put your whole body into it.
Move with the music.
You have seen me.
Now it is my turn to see you.
So you need to change right?
I suppose that would be okay.
I can change clothes at your place?
You are very good in the world history class yes?
I'll tell you one thing though.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Check-out time!
That was a great night.
I want to hear you say it.
How do you?
So do you want to be -- I mean how do you want to do it?
Yeah right here.
Yeah are you?
About the other day...
It's like a six or seven hour drive.
Did you know that it's...
I'm just not ready yet okay?
you're not your dad.
The two of us we're not your parents.
Do you not love me?
You want to do it?
Well I feel that...
a special moment between them.
Indeed I did.
It's time for us to...
Yeah we have.
But I did pick it up from you.
Just a second!
And I want to try to make it up to you.
You got in.
I got another question for you.
That's good that's what I needed to hear.
Look is that all you're interested in?
To make her you know...
Ready for what?
Well that's not really the name but we always called it that.
Yeah well anyway...
I thought you might have some advice brother to brother.
I mean I think tonight she might we might really there's a chance that -- you know.
Yeah but we'll still see each other.
Now think about it --
This is better.
This is just wrong.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Oh my fucking God.
You actually said that?!
I got an idea for something new.
I'm working on something new.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Either way works for us...
Now give me your hand...
Would you shut up?
Let's face it.
It's a how do you say...
But we're all in it together.
That's why we're trying to help you.
Oh give me a break!
Oh big man.
But I did and now I'm paying the price.
what do you want from me?
You're dead!
This is really happening.
What the hell -
Yeah right white boy!
Ha Ha ha.
Up to there?
Who gives a shit?
Now it's mine too.
Actually I'm waiting for someone.
We'll cut him off.
Seven million people.
No wonder he let her go.
Somewhere where there are no police and plenty to eat.
I know where he'll go.
We have to try.
We'll figure something out.
Cut out my fucking heart.
You fucking shut up!
What the hell do you want?
What was I?
You made me go there.
I tried to stop you!
You did this to me.
are you okay?
I'll meet you out back.
I know what his choice would be.
If you saw his face...
What makes you so sure this will work?
I knew you were full of shit.
He told you?
I'm not alright.
We both know that.
Listen I'm coming over.
Where did you go last night?
There's something wrong with you.
Wait I know this...
just stupid shit.
Like I should talk.
Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change!
I can see fine.
But I'm back in half an hour.
What about food?
Even beautiful women have to eat.
I read it.
A half an hour?
I have to work.
Let's go out.
Hey what more could I want?
I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
you feel okay now?
It's good to be back.
We met at the club then...
Did you cut yourself?
I thought all sorts of horrible things...
You must get out of here.
So you came after all.
Just in time it's getting interesting.
What good can you do?
Why are you being so fucking stupid?
There's nothing for you down there.
It's a bad place.
A stupid party.
some kind of club?
I have work to do.
Hey Sorry if I was out of line.
You must not have known him very well.
He's not like that.
Make sense to you?
I can follow that.
Yeah that's the word.
We'll see who -
There's something down there!
Okay what the hell are you up to?
Ha-ha-ha!
I should've known.
Hey I'm new here what do you want?
If you know about the church why ask such stupid questions?
I'm not the only one.
You'll never get the chance.
Where is it!
Tell me or else!
Goes like this...
If I wanted to I could let them believe that.
I always wanted to do that.
I leave these open.
Maybe something comes back to you.
That's not all...
We know you were with her.
This is power!
If only we could speak with him.
Say this heart thing works.
It's time to go.
We'll talk soon.
Not you too -
But then why did you...
You think it's silly.
Yeah well why did he hang out here?
How do you know about it?
wait a second...
Otherwise it's -
I feel sick.
What a way to go.
Let me write a letter.
You can go to hell!
I'm afraid she's not so lucky.
And so am I.
Thanks for your help.
Not that I know.
Why would he pick this one?
It's no man's land.
Maybe we should go now.
We'll call if any new -
Well here's what I think happened.
Not too well.
How well did er do you know him?
So you're from New York eh?
We have nothing.
Let him go then watch him.
Just let him go.
Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
It's something more.
Still that's not -
It's something much more interesting.
I think he can help you -
Twelve thirty-six a.
Twelve forty a.
There's two of them.
So maybe you were right.
When you're older.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you.
How to read.
Why were you so late tonight
Then come find me.
Then you'll have to make your own home.
Lots of people do.
I have to go now before it gets light.
I'm not sure but look.
Are you running away?
By your leave?
You're my friend!
You must have.
Did I tell you that?
Is everyone all right?
Who did you hear it from?
I'll never let go!
where are we?
Well yes but
It's so beautiful...
Now just get off the train.
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Come on up!
What happened to your parents?
That's quite a hard head you've got there boy.
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that!

Your home is in your heart in the future that you make for yourself.
I came back to my home with you.

You know it's been a long time.

Okay I'm very sorry.
Well stop listening to him.
Oh come on we've seen it.

This is my room.
We can- we can start again.

I was so close.
Oh I'm sorry!
What would they think?
But on the other hand...
There's people out there.
What-what-what?
No well stay there.
Stay there I'll come over right now.
I'll come over right now.
Just stay there I'll come right over.
He's God!
I mean this man is God!
I can think of another word.
That's just great.
so here just let me- I mean all right.
Come over here...
It's a free country!
I never read that.
Probably on their first date right?
well let's put it this way...
You know he really is.
He really is-
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah I love it there.
This is a great house really.
Then you know who lived here?
Sixteen years ago.
What are you making such a big deal about?
You know my girl friend-
And I've...
Have you two met?
He goes with that girl over there.
I just started getting...
Well sit down.
Yeah watch the road!
Everything our parents said was good is bad.
I think of us that way sometimes and I-I live here.
I think I have a few minutes left.
It's a good name for you.
How can we afford it?
On your pay?
All right-so we can afford it.
Who needs his business?!
Well yeah you always look pretty but that guy with you...
I look pretty.
Oh I can imagine.
Oh God you should've seen what I looked like then.
But I should be honest.
Oh yes that's right.
Did you see the new play?
We really had a good time.
And here you just-
Oh and there's another thing about New York.
Well I used to live there.
I used to live there for years.
You can have it to use.
Oh yeah stay here?
that's all you need.
You can come and stay here.
It was a wonderful set.
and we'll meet there.
that's fine too.
And we could just sit and talk...
Well hey that's that's nice.
of possibly working together.
No no no not at all.
I though it was...
Oh yeah really oh!
There were many men interested in you?
You should talk to Mr.
It's the way they do things.
More like a small person.
So is there anyone here for me?
No one looks new.
Would it make a difference?
Ten fifteen minutes ago.
When did you get here?
So who won?
Five years ago I was at the party remember?
I have a small window of time.
Hey listen I love her.
I never said any of this alright.
That is so great.
Maybe that's what this is all about.
And nothing's happening.
Something's gone.
And that's death.
But she's only twenty seven and...
And you've only just met.
one at a time?
Hold it down and one at a time.
I'd rather move actually.
I'm not that good.
It has your ring.
Had a little help?
Give me a minute.
wait what are you talking about?
What what's about?
Things always look much worse in the morning.
You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
It's always not this time.
If you can do it around me you can do it around anyone.
You can cut around it whatever it is.
Oh there you are.
No more work.
Look who's here before me!
So they tell me.
Not soon enough of course.
It changes your life you know.
She already has.
Thank you thank you thank you.
And so fucking...
Why would she care?
I'd say it was down.
Whatever you like.
I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.
I'll change back before we leave.
They must be a foot long.
What a fucking day!
You have to let me give out the number.
Let's get the kids.
You should have brought him.
Like part of the family.
Not for a second.
You think so!?
I've been working out a lot since the baby.
And I've been working.
Take good care of it.
And you're not the wife.
Well you could tell him otherwise.
It was good of you to be all this help.
Can you help me with this stuff?
You just need to get into a car and go.
You need to call your dad.
But she's alright.
Let's go upstairs okay?
And Dad was having a go about the garden.
Oh I'm so sorry.
It's hard to tell with her.
Look again in three months.
That for us?
We've heard lots about you.
You're them.
We live next door.
And you know our friends how?
We should do it again.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Do you want me to save you?
There's a test you know.
Well it's fucking time.
I know we're early we're so early.
I need a minute.
Just do what I say alright?
Before I forget.
And of course they said yes.
Listen I love you.
We've only been over this how many times?
I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
No small doing.
Will you make love with me?
How do you throw all that away?
I want it all.
A lot of bad shit.
All the good shit.
I'll never love anybody else you know.
I'll be with you.
Thanks for your trouble.
I have no idea who you are.
Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I'll never be ready.
I did want it for us.
I wanted you back.
You changed your mind.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.
We talked about it.
Who thinks that?
That's what all our friends think anyway.
Well there you go.
Last birthday was?
Everybody knows that...
It is true.
I talk to her more than you do.
That's how you love people.
And how hard it hit?
DO I want anyone else?
It's not like this all the time.
It's whether we can live together...
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Please let's not do this.
Let's get really clear here.
Yeah let's talk about that.
It was done.
We should have kept him upstairs.
Oh my god oh my god oh my god.
He'll find his way back.
He could be miles away.
Listen to yourself...
I think we should all take it tonight.
You know how he gets.
And that my dear friends is the day...
It's taken care of.
Of course we do.
I'll say as little as possible.
I'm looking forward to meeting you too.
You read the book again?
Well sure we can absolutely look at that again.
No no of course not.
How old is she?
Twenty-fucking-two?
I'm sorry look I meant to tell you.
It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I mean you're really back.
We're great.
I missed all of you.
I missed that.
In the morning after everyone's gone and there's just us.
What did you get me?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Most beautiful woman in the world.
Oh well we'll just have to try again.
She'll never call again.
She called last week to tell me she'll never call again.
Has she called?
Oh you know I am.
He's the best dog in the world.
They're both coming tonight.
Not my idea.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Do I put you off?
But I am right yes?
Thanks I'll take that.
Everyone says that.
good days bad days.
Anything I can do.
I really love you you know.
They gave me a list.
You lose this?
No nothing at all.
But the moment was exactly the same.
You must have been a baby.
Nine years just about.
That's a lot of those.
Eight years though.
It's really not the same thing.
What am I five?
Hold on to this.
You just put one foot in front of the other...
I've never done this before.
Let's go for a walk.
I need to leave you now.
I'll be your best friend.
And you know he really does not.
The wrong word maybe.
But you're very private people.
Very well put.
Yes in fact.
A little on the outside yes.
And it's difficult if I...
It says something about the two of you maybe.
I just put that in a client's home actually but in red.
No he's absolutely right.
it's really good of you to join us.
Can I get you a drink?
I think there are sixteen there.
I'm so happy you like it.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.
Women must tell you that.
How many women must tell you that.
Oh I love that.
I'm just great.
I'm so happy to be here.
And I'm so happy you asked me to.
No it's not...
Of course it's alright.
Let's just go home okay?
Jesus Christ it's a fucking dog!
He could get hit by a car!
You're not serious.
You've got to help me find the dog!
I let their dog out.
We need to find the dog.
Ready to go?
I love you so much...
But I think you're really nice people...
They're nothing like us.
They're like us...
I think you should then.
You'd better drink a lot of water.
I love it here.
And I love tonight.
And I love these people.
Well yes actually.
I'm sure you understand.
How long ago was it?
I so wish I'd known.
It's a beautiful house.
Are you working on a new book?
I'm twenty...
Oh good I'm worse...
Are you really twenty-two?
Oh yes indeed.
Do you need anything else?
Is there space here?
And I hope we can spend time together.
That's not an answer is it?
You're my best friend.
Oh you know.
Happy for you.
It's great okay?
Having the time of my life.
Well something's wrong.
Not something new.
Well that's something new.
I never like to talk about my work.
You're a shit.
"" ""I'd love to thanks.
Like the last time.
No not like the last time.
She was the rest of my life.
Exactly what I mean.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
You see that's worse.
It could be worse.
I want you to play.
You always wonder where your books end up.
I have it on tape.
We keep him in at night.
You've done enough.
Thank you for making me a part of it.
Whatever do you remember?
They said you were too real.
Oh my God sorry.
No you are not.
We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
His sister does.
Hey let's sit down.
Not an issue.
No no not at all...
I mean I've still got plenty of time.
I mean I still have a good six years whatever.
We could have three kids yet if we wanted.
Well are you sure about this baby thing?
What do you mean thank God?
You are not having your baby in London.
You'll hate it in London.
So how much do you hate her?
The both of you.
We're always in here.
It's much more personal in here.
I thought it was okay where it was.
So where should I put it?
Would you like to meet my husband?
Where are my kids?
And here they are!
Break's over.
When's lunch?
Tomorrow or the day after?
he's a...
You know you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be!
The little guy made it!
I'll make myself available...
I'm afraid he got...
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Sorry I got you in trouble.
I'm new...
I was born yesterday.
You're making the rest of us look bad...
You miss him?
I miss him already.
and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
how was your day?
A great life a beautiful wife and a few kids.
You held onto this all that time?
Well ""trouble"" is my middle name.
Actually my  middle name is.
I actually have something of yours...
you left it at the bar that night.
you never did tell me...
I just want you to know....
you were right!
We've found it!
Look at all this food'
What difference does it make...
something between us that first night at the bar.
So what makes you so special?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.
About five thousand four hundred by now.
Out here I'm just what?
Wait I hear something!
Want a list?
why'd I have to go looking for trouble?
Come on -- it's gone!
water -- oh you already said that.
That's not a name!
That's just a letter!
Come back here now!
You go back.
I order you to find out where we are!
OH MY GOD IT'S YOU!
as a matter of fact...
When can I see you again?
Oh that's okay I'll let him off this time.
You -- you think I'm right?
Of course not --
That's where I want to go!
he's wonderful...
your whole life...
was it all...
You can make it!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.
No no you're...
Maybe they went out for the evening.
She's kind of playing hard to get.
He'll watch out for you.
Leave a girl behind?
Make an example of yourself!
No one should have to.
Have him brought to me.
I've never seen anything like it General they're they're...
Fourteen-fifty hours sir.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Or that one.
That's correct sir!
I have no idea sir.
Oh of course --
May I cut in?
Not enough food?
you two are in love?
ONE TO NOTHING!
Alright let's move out!
Very well General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
They should be...
Just make sure you come back in one piece!
Carry on my good man!
Will that be all?
Off you go!
Now -- what were we saying?
Yes what else?
What do you see out there?
You know people ask me ""Doctor why are you always happy?
"" And I tell them it's mind over matter.
Do you get it?
The whole system just...
makes me feel...
Maybe I'll get lucky.
You have to help me.
Think of all the things I've done for you!
Hey did you hear what he said?!
Who said there was a girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.
No I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
I'm telling you he's got something against workers.
You sure this is a good idea?
This the place?
Who are you talking to anyway?
I'll come back for them later.
Who needs it!
Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Oh -- here it is.
Hello there Mrs.
It's a bet.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
All right -- I'll tell him.
Shut up and deal!
What about Mr.
That's funny -- so am I.
I'm fine all over.
You know how people talk.
For that matter you were wrong about me too.
What you said about those who take and those who get took?
I told you all along.
You see you were wrong about Mr.
I never thought he'd do it.
I suppose you heard about Mr.
Nothing's changed.
So I want you to keep a clear head.
I mean after that?
Might as well go all the way.
No -- just come as you are.
So let 'em.
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for one day.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Over a girl?
You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not really.
I went through exactly the same thing myself.
The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I really ought to be getting home.
Some people take some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know so.
You mean to someone like Mr.
What are you doing with that?
In this house you're supposed to.
Are you supposed to?
I think you should.
There's a call for you --
Who'd care?
You sure you want to throw that card?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
That's me with men.
Pick a card.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.
Why do people have to love people anyway?
Give what up?
I'm not very good at it.
You want me to move the television set in here?
Will you see that Mr.
Yes I've got it.
Oh you're wrong.
He told me --
As soon as I can walk.
What's her first name?
What's your friend's name?
And where are you now?
Someone from the office.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
You better figure it out -- exactly.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Oh -- of course.
It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
What kind of talk is that?
We were at the office party together --
Have a nice Christmas.
I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr.
He and I are like this.
Sent me a Christmas card.
Christmas -- family and all that --
This is a bad day for me.
No -- I like it.
There's something I want your advice about anyway.
There are just too many people here.
You're so right.
They may get the wrong idea how you found out.
Oh I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How do you know where I live?
So I see.
How is your cold?
What time does the show go on?
Oh I understand.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
You mean -- like a girl-friend?
I'm meeting somebody.
You mean tonight?
Would you like to?
Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I hope everything goes all right.
I'd love to hear them.
That makes me feel just terrible.
I better not get too close.
What did you do to your hair?
Just waiting for a friend.
Some weather we're having.
That's right Mr.
You realize what you're doing?
Not to me -- but to yourself.
How's that again?
What do you mean sorry?
Oh sure sure.
It's all yours.
You left your wife?
Well if there's anything I can do for you --
No thank you Mr.
Is there anything you need -- money --?
Yes sir -- I understand.
Put me down for Thursday again.
That's the life all right.
I ask you -- is that fair?
I know how it is.
Is she -- the lucky one?
And I want to thank you --
You like your office?
You too sir.
Have a nice time.
It's that cold --
You mean -- you and me?
How would you like to go tonight?
I'm not through with you yet.
But if you'd just let me explain --
What -- what's that got to do with me?
I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
On account of me.
Oh this is Mr.
Okay get your clothes on.
Now will you get out?
What do I --?
The door is always open -- to my office.
Let me check.
I'll get back to you.
They are indeed.
I'll pay you on Friday.
All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Well how about that?
I was just about to call you.
Let me worry about that.
Make it thirty minutes.
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
Well that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Okay you made your point.
We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Just the other day at the staff meeting I was telling Mr.
You know me with girls.
By the way whatever happened to her?
Oh you mean my body.
All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Where are you moving to?
Well I have things to do --
You know where I am if you need me.
So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Live now pay later.
Any of that coffee left?
Just as long as she's okay.
Want to tell me what happened?
Let me get my bag.
Oh that's not me.
It's just that once in a while I have some people in for a drink.
Had a late call?
You bet I will.
Just clear out will you?
Did I do something wrong?
Ask anybody around here.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
You got a girl-friend?
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Talking to himself.
Can we help the man?
It's more like a lost weekend.
Let's get her walking.
Do you know who this is?
And what happened to you?
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Get more coffee.
And I'm a doctor.
But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Well -- thank you.
What's he got against you anyway?
Ring out the old year ring in the new.
All set for what?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone.
But we're all set.
Yes I'm all right.
Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
I just thought as long as it was paid for --
I have a present for you.
Yeah we better.
We better keep it here.
How could I be so stupid?
But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls?
I was never very good at history.
Well that's more like it.
Yeah -- that's me.
"" It's not that easy.
Anyway this is the wrong time.
I love you -- remember?
I have that date -- remember?
If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Are you sure that's what you want?
You had nothing to do with it.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
You're not being funny.
We talked about a lot of things.
Remember what we talked about?
I have a date at eight-thirty.
I'm just beginning to get over it.
It's been hell.
Like old times.
How long has it been -- a month?
It's on the way.
Let me take that.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
It's okay for Thursday.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Like hell you will.
I told you -- with my mother.
You got to watch those things.
Makes a person feel cheap.
It's a quarter to nine!
You were a big help.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
See if they'll what?
It's a thought.
One for all -- all for one --
No -- absolutely not --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
I said I like all of them.
Good -- like I said take your pick.
I like all of them --
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
What's it matter?
Get to the point.
I know I know it's all right.
Come in this way.
How long were you up there?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
Which part is that?
How about a drink?
He was working A.
What are we doing here?
Looks that way.
Yeah it is.
That's a light down there --
But we're running low on the other.
How much is left?
I went into radio school.
It's what we do.
Call me what sir?
Why they call you that?
No I saw another.
Right or left?
Yeah -- like keep out --
When'd you do it?
What the hell is it?
Get in there!
Well get in there.
Who knows what's up there?
I'll go with him --
I brought his body back down.
I never heard about that.
Would he remember you?
Nobody comes in here.
They must have seen the fire.
How did they know?
They're coming again tonight.
What -- happened here.
It happens from time to time.
This is much better.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good.
We took them from the dead.
Yeah -- yeah I can understand how you feel.
They far enough?
Let's get a look at it.
That's right sir.
Six to eight feet.
How big it is?
What about this point here?
You talk like him.
I met him.
When did you hear?
They put out two or three for every one I needed.
You can still live.
I'll tell you what makes sense!
How did we get here?
You know what you're doing?
And do you know why?
Yes you know why.
How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.
I want to think.
Give me water.
My thinking is clear.
Yeah I like it...
And for an idea!
Do you know me?
You know you're right.
What other reason could you have come?
Am I right about these things?
No -- no sir.
You were not coming here to see me?
Why did you come to...
He said his last words to me.
Were you with him when...
His death was -- yes he died as he lived.
Men looked up to him...
He died as he lived...
Both of us...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
You were his friend...
You must have been if he had given you this...
If he sent you to his home.
He was the best this country had -- he was --
You knew him best.
Yes it is true.
That's the hard part for me...
I knew him better than anyone...
I knew him best.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Did you know him very well?
Take us to him.
No -- leave it --
The other one --
I was running.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
But it'll be back.
It'll be back.
You hear it again?
Yeah Jesus Christ!
Then let's get the hell out of here.
We're on his side.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you sir.
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
His name is...
And shut up.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Is that where he is?
I've asked myself that question.
Of love too.
You listen to him.
God these are good.
I kept these people off you you know.
What if I say no.
I know you've heard of him.
What's a big question?
What will you do after the war?
Have you someone there?
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Right now -- I am.
Anyone got a card?
You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
I just want this over with.
I'll get you there all right.
Listen I've got some money put away --
You should know something.
What about you -- why come back?
How did she..?
Had some good years.
No one knew her.
Blue eyes give you away.
My wife had blue eyes.
How long have you been up north?
I have not but I very much want to.
My home is here.
Once I put him on it it's all over.
I'll tell you everything later.
I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I thought you were dead or worse.
That's my line.
Be careful okay?
Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.
Yes I think I do.
But be with what you do and the way you live?
Look why get into this again.
It's been nice so far.
We're together --
It's exactly what you meant.
I'll wear it for you.
And I can wear it when we go home.
Oh I found this at the post office.
Had your name on it.
Was there any trouble?
No way can he get away with this.
I'll be back by tonight.
It's not your business.
I'll go into town with you.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
He still might be around.
He's coming around fine.
Okay by me.
Had no choice...
Given the situation.
Leave it here.
Can you walk?
And no way -more-
Gets along better than ever.
I'm sure she's fine.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
That's why I want to work on the front lines where what I do means something.
That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
What do you know about people?
I've seen plenty like you.
Told that's what our old man was.
That was fine money.
We'd be out of here in a few hours.
You got one?
How many do you see?
Told you I'm fine!
I got money there.
Remember that five thousand?
Take it and walk away.
Those cover most everyone.
I'm here to do my job.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
The People's Friend.
It would take days.
I'll have a little sit-down.
We need to work together.
Send him down to her.
Does he have people?
See you again maybe.
We just got off on the wrong foot.
Bank on it.
If that was all fine.
I got it from here.
But I would.
No I better stay at my post.
Why do this?
And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.
I'm real sorry.
In a while you're gone from this country.
But we live here.
There'll be three four men at the most.
I'm the one should be sorry...
I never should've let him go over there.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Back at my place...
Here this is for you.
It's over here and now.
What does this matter to you?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Any idea who could've done it?
I'm too old for this shit.
We'll go with you.
Have to pass on that lunch.
Bet you're right.
Told you this was trouble.
Who's side are you on anyway?
I just as soon he stay gone.
We do this my way.
Thought that door was open last night...
We got a problem.
They'll have to come right past us.
There's what they're waiting on!
We were just talking about him.
He'll keep.
But now no way.
Bring him in yourself.
Well maybe he has nice friends.
How was it talking to him?
I want us to go out.
Leave me be!
What is it that you want?...
You want what?
Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody.
You ought to get Mr.
I'm on the last page.
Stay out of this...
He's good...
His home number.
My home number is on this card.
And it's not necessary anyway.
How long has he been having problems?
What work do you do?
Tell me how bad it is.
and I let him talk me into it.
Not your name...
what are you telling me your name for!!
It's certainly not.
Just let me talk.
in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm not the answer for you.
It's four in the morning.
Let's take a walk.
I had to see you...
What a break...
Okay to say something now?
There's an example.
The two might go together.
That seems like a good choice.
You have my number.
I'll take you...
I'll take a bus.
If that means anything.
Do it then.
Get the dog picked up.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I'll never forget you said it.
It came out first...
You two hit it off.
That's why you brought me?
Is that really why you brought me...
It's one idea...
There are lots of reason...
If you ask me...
I'll say ""yes.
Tell me why you wanted me here.
that's a personal question.
Tell me why did you bring me?
Here's the trouble with never.
Takes months to know...
They work little by little.
Here I goes...
I have this -- what?
who I used to see all the time...
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Can we order first?
And mean it...
Now or never.
I need one and quick...
just sit down and give it to me.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Just him and that's it.
Okay you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Stop asking everyone.
I never saw him playing ball.
Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow.
Can I have that one?
Just not anybody in this car.
and that's what makes it hard.
really come on.
Hey -- you let him...
Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Let me go in back.
Where should we sit?
Oh my God who did that to you?
Thanks for being on time...
That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Are you still coming?
Is there another way to see it?
I need a hand and where'd she go.
Funny I thought it was a strong point.
You take off when you have to.
Oh I'm sorry...
"" I thought I said ""what?
Now I want you to do something for me.
Nice of you...
I also wrote one part...
I wrote I'm sorry...
when I said I was never...
What you did changed my life.
Hey what I did for you is working out?
So you'll be at work?
You waiting for me to say something?
What sort of thing do you want?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Why did yo do this for me?
That's not why I'm here...
I was working...
I'm sorry about the hour.
any chance you'll get back to work today?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How do you know about my mother?
What about your mother?
My son is sick okay?
Yes I do as a matter of fact...
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home...
You all set here?
I'd say you were kind.
So so much for eyes.
But as long as you bring up age...
how old are you?
You know he's a little dog.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
So what are you doing with a dog?
What's wrong with your son anyway?
Why not try ours...
It sure sounds like your son will.
It's not your table.
It's the place's table.
This once you can sit at someone else's station.
He's just the best.
Will you please take it?
Let him take you home.
One night with me!
I'll take care of myself --
But what about...
I just love her.
We held each other.
What I need he gave me great.
All right cut me a break.
But you're beautiful...
What have you been thinking about?
Was this supposed to be your room?
I really would.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
I'll pay whatever.
Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
but you're not interested in changes in me...
so it's like I always told you...
when it comes to people you...
Two years ago...
You changed the room around...
You must leave.
If you want to see me you will not do this.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
You are very certain my dog is okay...
not a chance.
I own this guy.
There was no one else.
I'm on the move too much.
So what's new anyway?
the hand will come back...
they're sure...
so I'll see you tomorrow.
Do you drive?
Think white and get serious.
So I'm out.
Can you take him?
And now there are other things.
About a dog.
Hey -- you called me...
"" Look at you...
You sense a mark.
It looks like it really went over.
She's nice.
So they need him for a couple of days.
He wants him back.
He'll be by tomorrow.
It's been five weeks...
I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Nobody's ever been in here before.
Thanks for looking after him.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
You're taking him...
you're taking him -- this will clear the books.
You want to say ""no"" to me?
I almost want you to try saying ""no.
I hate doing this.
Hope you find him.
I love that dog.
No it's all right.
I'll just watch.
Shall I get her for you?
Yes we do...
See he's right.
He's given you everything.
How you doing great one?
Is he dead yet?
Oh is he dead?
Just move on.
Here I go.
I think you've got a chance.
You know who you want.
So do something...
go over there.
But you know where you're lucky?
Well if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
It was better than this...
Did you like it that much?
you love her?
Look we both want the dog -- and...
They did a nice job...
I told you to go on in.
Another place where?
You got real problems.
So it's a good five hours back.
It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I'm working again.
You heard me though right?
Good -- take good care.
I give you that one...
You consider your life easy.
Not it at all really.
and she used to...
I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it...
Never a break.
Let's do the small talk in the car.
I almost died.
Got any easier questions?
Okay if I sit here?
Would you leave now please?
Yo yo yo...
Now we'll both call him.
No need to stop being a lady...
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Please just leave.
Thank you for walking him.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Could you take it just a little easy Mr.
Well I work all the time.
I mean never.
not if there's fire.
not on this door.
Not for anything.
Do you realize that I work at him?
do something to him?
Maybe this can wait.
You're talking about your dog.
What's he look like?
How do you write women so well?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...
You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you.
You have no idea what your work means to me.
I just want to tell you...
Just a second -- he has to go.
well there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
is that correct?
Do anything you think of -- try different thing.
Now I'll tell you something.
I'll tell you this.
What I've said only a mark would say.
It makes sense right?
Did you see how I did that?
That sure is a lot of money.
Yeah you are and you hate it.
How do I know this?
What does that fucking mean?
Just tell me that.
How'd you fucking know?
What's okay?
We go around once.
Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm sorry but I just got to ask you.
We both know what you were doing.
Sixty- forty at best.
Two long fucking years.
So get the hell out!
You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
Talking too much again.
right to the chair.
I heard it all.
Yeah it's terrible.
He probably had it coming but all the other people.
It's been all over the radio.
I know just what you mean.
Not too good at small talk eh?
So you're from around here?
I asked you --
Such language in front of a lady.
We believe we will know where and when.
You're too late.
Take us there.
Paid in full.
Who is the mark?
The fucking contract!
How did he know?
I'm done!
Do you fucking hear me!
I'm fucking gone!
It cost us.
I bet you fucking know!
I see it!
Get out now!
I'm not normal.
Was she the only one?
I tried to stop it.
She was taken.
Someone like me like you.
It happened to you before?
It can be.
I'm sure you will.
I'm playing white remember.
Then they went into their room and made up.
Did he explain how this happened?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
It's always been that way.
I mean look at us in this room.
I mean we look like just another couple.
But what are we?
Another man much older.
She has four kids.
The young guy works for her.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.
I wanted to so I did.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Jesus if someone had --
It was no big deal.
I saw them leave I went in.
I went into their room this afternoon.
They're worth less points.
I think I got one today.
Here I am again.
Ten years later here you are again.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.
Ten years ago.
I was here ten years ago I'm here now.
In this city outside that bank?
I mean you're not him.
I told you he will.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
You'll have the money.
He'll have to see with his own eyes whether or not I am there.
He'll come.
Then we wait.
You'll be here.
He'll go up the back too much traffic in the front.
This is the bank.
It's too late now.
We'll have to deal with these.
If I had known we'd be using --
I paid a lot for these.
Cheap as shit.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Not that I would know but you look like you're really good at it.
Where did you learn it?
Just be careful.
Buy a book.
I know what you are thinking.
I got to get out of this room just for a little while.
It's beautiful out here.
What do you think he's doing?
Do you think he's here?
You can have the bed.
The chair is fine for me.
What will you do if this works if we get the money?
What happens if you do?
Do you think about the game?
The things I need to get done.
What do you think about?
I need to think.
That's where he'll be.
Is it as nice as they say?
Hey where are you?
For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you understand what I am saying?
Did it ever bother you?
Just the first one.
Are they usually like that?
My first take?
Tell me about the first time.
The same reason everyone does.
They are very good at what they do.
But you knew what they were training you for?
I was just different.
Some people said that.
I never thought so.
How did you get into the business?
As soon as you get into this business all you can think about is getting to the top.
Until then there is nothing.
You are nothing.
Where you wanted to be?
He was the best.
He was on top.
I never won.
It looks like white's game.
Better than playing with yourself.
It's not the same is it?
How can we possibly help each other?
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this help you unless I know more about you.
He will know everything about you.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.
You think you can do it again.
He'll come for you and he'll find you.
And we will both need money.
And you want to use me to get him?
The nature of the business.
So this is something between you and him?
Who is that other guy?
Until a minute ago.
No stay in the car.
I want you to understand something.
Now you understand why I'm here.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that maybe more.
What in the hell do you know?
I'm part of the game just like you.
I work for the government.
How did you know I had a cat?
One hour per man.
This is not a game.
I thought it was interesting --
The point is they are paying for information.
Is that all you want?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Can you tell me about it?
Do you ever think about starting over?
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Why are you working today?
Whatever you're having.
Did you call --
I used to think about it.
She wanted kids.
I thought about moving somewhere far away like Europe.
' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.
It was something that I could never get away from...
but now I feel it's okay.
I feel good.
Some are ready some are not.
Right now I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
It seems very funny to me.
That's exactly what I told myself.
'  That's nice.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.
I knew this day was coming.
What do you call it anyway?
One hundred thousand?
Is that a lot?
It's a common question.
My wife was always getting on me about that.
'  I never would though.
Hey do you mind if I talk a little?
Just a little ways.
If you could follow me?
I have all day.
This will take some time.
You wish to close this account today?
No better than me.
You know I have many friends you should meet more of them.
I see too much of him and he's changed.
So how's your work?
He'll come through I'm sure.
What do you like about this place these people Chris?
What are you having?
Some deal you did there!
God I think I need a holiday.
Anything else I can do for you?
You're in the clear keep it that way I'll be okay.
Good what's his number?
Do you know someone with a phone?
And if you're wrong.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
You could have a third or so of it there.
Now you're using that word.
I tell you they're one big happy family over there.
He got that one right.
I stopped by your office.
Tell me some bad news?
Tell me some good news.
You got a name for this thing?
Shit no it'll be twice cost.
Sure I'll do it.
Nothing it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
What are you on about?
Come on Chris give me a hand.
Both see you later.
Red or white?
No it could take me hours.
We should have that floor done in a day or so.
Do you think anyone will really come here?
When your ready Son!
Like a hand?
No not if you've got better things to do.
It looks new they might miss one or two.
They'll never get us.
We got a party tomorrow night.
Yeah I'll take some.
Is it gone four-thirty?
Well it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'd love to get in there.
But how did the wall get here?
It must be on the other side of this.
Yeah I'm beginning to see that.
I've been saying that since we met.
I'll try not to I'll leave that to you.
Anyway there's still plenty more of it.
Tell them we're working for the University.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Just two things.
Can you make a start on that?
No he was talking about girls I think.
Yeah that could be job number two.
No I got nothing till Tuesday.
You got my word on it.
Alright I give in.
Do you want to come and look?
We could make a run for it?
Okay it's in here somewhere.
Okay we're listening.
We've got to show them there's more to it.
Maybe but someone's got to make a stand.
No it's the whole idea behind it.
How did they get this place?
Oh yeah what's that?
This place is getting expensive too used to be twelve.
Anything in it?
Yeah let's check out the low-life.
Well this place is too expensive so you've had it.
It is your round though!
And not even then sometimes.
Yeah but it's not just that.
Turn around quick!
Yeah pretty well.
No by road?
Do you know the way?
Sure I'm sure!
Yeah no problem.
Time for lunch I think.
That's my mum's.
We should be done by the weekend.
I've been around.
But I love you!
I'm sorry about what I said really I am.
There's nothing there for me.
But we could go to London and live in England.
If you get out can we be together again.
I hope so!
Will it help to get you out?
Then tell me what will happen?
No I love you really.
That's not true we have a great time together.
I've said I'm sorry.
Let's forget about it and go stop by my place so I can get changed.
I think I'm stupid.....
All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
Do you want another drink?
Yeah you're right....
I've got an idea!
I want you so bad.
Let's have a look anyway.
Everybody is at home it's no good.
No not just yet.
God I love you!
Alright I'm coming.
Come on I've got to go.
Come on Chris!
Look just hear me out okay?
You're everything a guy could want.
Well get me and Chris a drink then.
You used to read.
About forty minutes.
How long will it go for?
Yes it's looks good.....
The others will just be house lights.
Yeah it's a simple piece.
They'll do it.
Yep it's all yours.
I'll do my best.
Is the place open.
It's not so much.
So I hear do you know some of the stage hands?
Do reckon I could fit through here?
Yeah for sure.
I think it will be finished in the morning.
maybe one hour.
It is okay........
What pay-check?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
A month Jesus!
That's only the half of it.
Ah so what?
How do I know what's being said?
You mean it's started?
No it should be over soon.
Will this thing take long?
Will they free me?
Oh shit yeah.
Better than you.
Yeah but it was okay.
Did you take your things over to my place?
I had it coming from someone.
I'll be okay just get me home.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
No just a coffee.
Yeah seems okay.
Why are you doing all this what for?
That's not what you said last night.
I thought I'd help out.
We had a deal!
Good wait here it will not take long and then you may go.
Would you like your things now?
You may use my office.
I'll need to make a phone call.
You have the letter and my word if you wish you may wait upstairs....
I'm not sure it's possible.
Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Not all of them!
Good try Mr.
Why did you break into that particular building?
Yes they had nothing to do with it.
This is your doing?
No way he even gave me back pay.
Come on that shit can wait.
But I have to finish this....
No problem is it at your place?
Okay Okay but I want it right back.
Give me a break will you.
How often do I ask you for something?
Alright I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were okay?
Yes if you can get him free.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You really are a piece of work you know that?
So what have you got to say for yourself?
Was he good in bed?
Can we talk in your office?
Shall I look after the rest?
It's more than what you're worth.
That's my bag.
Yeah so I hear.
Well come on sit down.
Oh that's it?
Maybe it is!
People might think it's about us!
When the hell did you write that?
Then have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
Have you lost all control of this city?
So who is in the building?
We're not sure...
And I have no idea why.
You're with who you should be.
I'm sorry about how we --
I'll tell her you were here.
Heart be still.
She's coming over here...
There's nothing more.
Everything's being done but it's not enough.
I have to find something -- more.
You have two parents.
We're both here for you even --
Now it's okay?
He wants to talk to you.
She'll let you know what she needs.
I have no idea what to say.
How to act.
What if I do the wrong thing?
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
That'd be something.
I could do it if I tried.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could take after Dad too.
You take after me.
A late night or an early morning?
To see your father?
You look nice.
He wants to show now.
That's over.
-- I like the car I have.
It could help with a new car --
About a job.
We're sorry man!
She's not.
She's got her own ideas.
What's she doing in there?
He's supposed to be here.
What kind of a man are you son?
I'm very sorry --
But if you could you would?
Will you do something for me?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Can I -- go out?
It costs money to do this at home.
I'll talk to your father.
Whatever you need.
I've talked to your father.
That I want you to take me home.
Anything you want.
I feel like I have no one.
I made you do too many things kept you up all night --
Then I'll take you home.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
I'm sick.
Yes one of many.
I try to keep my power.
That what you do?
It gives them power.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
What about your father?
So what do you want to see?
But when it's done it will have twice the power of this one --
Where's the one you're building?
I was twelve.
When did you build this?
I just left you out of it.
What'd you tell your father?
What would you do up here?
My father used to take me here.
How do you know this place?
Twice a year.
This happen to you?
You make me feel...
I might do it wrong.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
You're sometimes not sure?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
You're in two places at once.
Stand right here.
We're doing something --?
Before we do this.
I know you want to.
I have to get you home by one.
I wanted this to be a date.
I'm not allowed to date.
But not as a date date.
Why are you doing all this?
She great or what?
I heard what you did.
It means you can do anything.
When I have something to say.
So you're talking to me?
Take a look at yourself.
Maybe some of that is true --
People can see.
So were you.
You were great the other night.
Then maybe you can read mine.
That would be the reason.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Just not at school...
The play's in a couple of weeks.
There is no point.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
In ten words or less?
You're really into God right?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Looking for something -- someone.
The world of the dead?
I'll get something for us to drink --
And you have to meet my father.
Be two places at once...
You want to tell me...
So what else is on this list?
It's like a to-do list but for my life.
I'll take a chance.
Maybe a little of both.
You got some kind of list?
The reason I got the part...
So you agree you need help?
Not like you.
Fire is like a living thing.
Then we both know.
I'll point.
-- This play means a lot to me.
Are you pretty --?
You mean care what you say?
My hair is my hair.
What's more to know --?
-- This your idea of small talk?
He goes to my father's church.
He could've died --
Not even God.
But he did change.
Just not enough.
I want what's best for you.
But that's not the real reason.
Me all to yourself!
It's time to tell him.
It would be the right thing.
I'm asking how much.
It was a play.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Dad I've become a woman without her.
Just not a pretty one.
Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
He wants help with his lines --
Tell me about him.
You've been well?
You know about this stuff?
I need to be with her.
You go on home.
If there is a God how could he let this happen??!!
We've lived with this for over a year now and --
How -- how long does she have?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Since I was five.
How about your family?
Like what sir?
So talk to us about something.
I care for her.
Let's get something straight.
But I know what you're about.
So so so so --
You're in the play?
You came here to give me my report card?
They're -- good.
It's mine to give.
Where did you get --?
-- You can and you will Mr.
Then you remember more than I do.
Some of us remember how your father --
When do I get time for me?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
How would you do that Mr.
I'd do that --
I want to come back.
Now I can do what I want.
You just act like one.
Like you'd make it to June.
So what did we just make?
Where's your old man?
is the number one single?
Third time they've been out there this week.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
but not tonight.
like I know you.
Oh no I'm fine...
You seem a little...
But he does!
Oh I'm late!
What time does school start around here?
I never thought of school!
Oh sure I remember you.
You remember me...?
Have we ever met before?
How was school today?
Oh -- I'm all right.
Dinner's ready now!
Maybe if I used my left....
Your line George!
Maybe we'd better go over the plan again.
How many times do I have to explain it to you?...
You know it I know it...
Look I'll write it down for you okay?
This is different!
George she's beautiful right?
To see it!
I was using it last night.
Run out of gas?
Like what if we run out?
You're the only Mr.
If you have something to say say it so the whole class can hear.
You have a name?
I'm new here and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Yes that's my name.
Who are you young man?
I'm seventeen years old!
Yes you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
I'm sorry there's no answer.
What number do you want?
You have a good evening now.
Home school here...
Good evening one said.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen!
What do you call this?
What year is this?
Actually it could happen at any time.
It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
That's just what I needed to hear.
That's exactly what I said!
That's all taken care of.
Why would she do that?
George asked her out!
He had to!
I saw him walk her home!
The test is this Monday!
You'd have to be...
Look it's not a big deal!
You did what?!?
Well it was there.
I am serious.
Let me put it on a level you can understand.
All I did was answer the door!
Nobody's supposed to see you here!
That's just great!
Of course it works...
On second thought there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
I can get behind -- I agree with you.
You see what happened --
Must have been?
Used to live?
I do live here.
He will be.
It sent me back in time!
Sure he agreed quickly.
I built this machine to see the future.
Exactly two minutes difference...
That's what I came over here for!
A time machine!
Hold the phone.
Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he!
Then where the hell is he?
Oh right right...
See you after school.
I'll see what I can do....
It's not fair!
I run this place!
Now who's being stupid?
Is he around?
Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
What did you do to yours?
You think yours did?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
He said not to tell.
Well he's gone.
They come with the house.
Nothing much to speak of.
What you been doing?
Kind of round like so...
I'll show you if you want.
What'd they look like?
You lost that one?
You ever held another job before?
Well I've got to read them first.
What do you say now?
Just not this big a one...
Then why'd you do it?
You like people?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
No you're not either.
Go on get out of here.
It's always a good idea to have one around.
She'd get along okay.
Well it's not good enough.
Guy like you.
That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
You know before I met her nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl.
What'd you come out here for?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Have you got a better idea?
Come on let's make a run for the car.
How about over here?
I'm not saying that I know.
no place to get anything good to eat.
Never had any reason to.
Fact: True but not with each other.
Soon as I start the car...
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Well why you always walking behind me?
Well we'll see about that...
Just to keep him out of the sun.
What'd you put him in there for?
Think I got 'em?
Put that down.
Listen I'll be back in a while.
You said that once already...
Too late now.
Listen maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
We better call the doctor...
I'll say how it happened part I saw.
I can look and see.
How bad off is he?
I came in the front.
Well that's the point stupid.
That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Is that all there is to it?
It's your play.
Let's not pick them.
They're so nice.
What a nice place.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Anybody ever call you ""Red""?
Bring it along.
Or thinking about it.
Just seemed like the right move...
Well stop the world.
Well I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it...
He'll say that?
Can I be honest?
That's my father.
I got to run.
I'm not in love with the stuff okay.
You still in school?
Well nobody asked me what I thought.
I got some stuff to say.
I'll try anything once.
I said mine.
It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
How'd that be?
Stay as long as you like.
Couple of hours maybe.
This your place?
It's mine all right.
Just a second now.
See we're about out...
I'm sorry sir but we've got to ask you for it.
Say you got any gas?
Hold it right there.
Then that's it!
So we'll help.
So I was right.
That's nice to know...
I think I'm on to something.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.
Make sure this is on the level.
We're busy people here.
Almost fifty years ago.
First thing I did.
Same one you had yesterday?
Does he know we're coming?
Let her out?
Let her out.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
So what's he up to?
I look great.
How do we look?
Do we look okay?
She wants a picture.
This is pretty important.
Tell 'em something--!
What is this thing?
But just remember...
Just their side.
Stay here I'll be back.
That's just what you would say.
Oh my God it's all real...
it really is real.
I should go with you.
and maybe more important if you believe in yourself.
I wish he was.
He's real enough.
You're putting me on.
Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Just do the best you can with what you have...
I should have know.
I always felt like I did like there was another me...
Did you have family there--?
Was she pretty?
Why're you looking at me like that?
Everybody okay up here?
I lost my room this morning.
What the hell else can I do?
Did I say anything was wrong?
Nobody's a nobody.
I'm a nobody.
Did you say...
We know each other pretty well I think.
What's it like out there in the real world?
World Watch One.
It's not here!
How far back?
Better than him.
Can you play that thing?
Seen plenty of it too.
So will you if you stick around.
What'd you do before?
Can I ask?
Hey so was Mr.
You're thinking of Mr.
I met my first wife that way.
Plus the man can drive.
Bet I do.
What're you doing tonight?
I want to know!
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
What do you mean so to speak?!
Jesus Christ you wrote his  what about before that?
Well usually they're...
What are they about?
Yes I'm afraid I have.
Oh he's...
What is it you have to do exactly?
How's Bill?
Everything'll be all right.
I'm sorry to be such a...
If I can.
If you could I'd 
Pick it up...
Pick it up.
No sometimes he just...
sorry for him!
I know this must look...
Perhaps the three of us Mr.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also.
I'll be fine...
Will you be alright?
He will be...
Be still now!
Who is that?!
Stop it Bill!
Not anything Bill.
This'll sometimes help.
Could you come back later?
I'm trying to think...
Well that's what he said.
Said he was in the insurance business.
I never saw him with anyone else.
Yeah he's funny that way.
Ever talk to him?
A week eight nine days 
What DID you mean?
What kind of write?
But I do know what you're doing with that drink.
And what would that be son?
actually no Bill...
Still I must say.
It's still a little early for me.
Just Bill please.
Well what do I tell him?
Who said write?
Well he's taken an interest!
He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
He's taken an interest!
What the hell did you say to him?
Where'd you get THAT from?
He's taken an interest.
What do you think this is?
Well not much.
I'm just having trouble getting started.
Sure he did.
Life is too short.
Then who should I talk to?
No I'm 
Well you just...
Well I'm just asking.
I just thought you should know that.
Well I'm...
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too.
I mean important.
This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
I think it's really big.
No what did it say?
You decide what you want and I'll make it happen.
What do you do far a living?
We have to talk a little business.
I think I can get them to go as high as two.
You'll be back?
Well keep it for me.
You'll think about me...
It's more than I've got.
You asked me to believe you  well I do.
I've got no one else here!
Everything's okay believe me.
Just for a while.
If that was her name.
They can tell that...
I believe you  I KNOW you.
But why should the police?
Stop with the police!
This does not look good!
They hang people for this!
Maybe it was her...
What do you think happened?
I said hold on so hold on.
We can sort it-
Will you stay with me till they get here?
Whatever the problem is we'll sort it out.
Are you sure 
You'll see me again.
I mean to a guy from New York.
Your room does that too?
I'll miss you.
In a few days.
Where there's life there's hope.
What is it they say?
Where there's a head there's a hope?
Know about it?
Brother I wish I had a piece of that.
Well it's been better.
Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play.
How goes the life of the mind?
Something they need?
Okay so I've got a weight problem.
Jesus what a day.
Jesus what a day I've had.
Ever had one of those days?
Yeah as a matter of fact they did.
Well it's your first time.
And you're out of your weight class.
It's okay it's okay.
All right now when I say ""Ready...
That's the whole game.
That's all right really 
Okay but hell you should know what it is.
I'm not that interested in the act itself 
He's good.
Funny stuff funny stuff.
It's just the three of us now...
Seen a doctor?
Goes away for a while but it always comes back.
I heard you walking around in here.
Well we've got something in common then.
I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Sure you could!
But in a way that's exactly the point.
Well that's a good question.
The common man.
What do I write about?
Hell why not?
Everyone wants quality.
Thanks I'll keep it in mind.
And what's your line Mr.
Not easy but 
It's just that I was trying to work 
a quick one sure...
That's all right really thank you.
I tried to show you something beautiful.
Something about all of US 
And that's why he's gone.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Yes sir they 
They'd love to see me sit this one out.
He's a dear friend.
I want you to pull this out of your head.
No no Mr.
But that's no reason for you not to be.
Honest I mean.
Can I be honest Mr.
Work hard play hard!
That's what I hear anyway...
That's okay that's okay that's okay  that's just fine.
You were dead wrong.
Is that more than one thing?
Why do I run it?
Sat whatever the hell you want.
Thanks but I wanted a place that was less...
Where did we put him?
The others are being sent.
Do you have room service?
Okay then everything seems to be in order.
May I help you sir?
He's a MAN!
Was he the idea man?
What did he 
Nine days  Tuesday 
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
But you know with the head still on.
Not too far from here.
He's a little funny in the head.
Would that be good enough for ya?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
THANK him for it!
We're off to a good start.
I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Okay the hell with the story.
We just bought the story.
Saturday Evening Post.
A couple days ago.
Where were you tonight?
I went after him.
You're not supposed to be in here.
You're on leave man.
Did you find out about her parents?
Take care you hear?
In his bed.
I know about your husband.
Put your fucking hands up!
Put your hands up!
She's brilliant.
Why did you change your name?
That's how I'd do it.
She's really sick you know.
She makes up that story about me.
It was just that one time.
I know the type.
My interest is in you not in her.
What is this interest you've got in her?
Something's on with you.
I'm a big girl.
What was she like in school?
She must really be something.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I mean it thank you.
I did it for you.
You did it for me.
But take my advice.
Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
Sometimes I really hate you.
We went to bed -- what was it?
-- ten or fifteen times?
She said what you said she'd say.
It's been three months.
How is your -- personal life?
Things are fine.
So -- how are things?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with okay?
You know it is.
You know I'm fine!
How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
What is this -- some kind of...
How did it end?
I finished my book.
Somebody always does.
What happens to them?
What are you writing about.
I'm writing a book.
I'm very good at research.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
Come over here and tell me no.
Did you miss me?
I decided to give you one more chance.
What about the other night.
What about last night?
I would've paid more.
I wanted to know everything about you.
About three months before I met you.
There was this girl I met while I was in college.
to set me up?
Make love to me.
Did you like her to watch?
She left right after you.
She wanted to watch me all the time.
You're in over your head.
You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
How's your back?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Did you think it was so special?
She's seen everything before.
I'll meet you there.
How's your new book?
To see if I can get away with it.
I'd miss you.
You can get into trouble though.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
When did you write it?
To see if he can get away with it.
Why does he do it?
It's not the same thing is it?
My wife used to call me that.
You're not easy to figure.
Would you like to come up and have a drink?
They have friends.
How exactly did you hear?
Did you like it too much?
For my book.
You want a name from the present?
There's a name from the past.
They got in the line of fire.
I'd like to ask you some too.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
You know all about me.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
For my writing.
Even though you were fucking him.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
How did you feel when he died?
What's your new book about?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Was there anyone with you last night?
We had a drink at the club.
We left together.
He went home.
Did you go home with him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Were you with him last night?
About a year and a half.
I was fucking him.
Exactly what do you have in mind Mr.
Can we get you anything?
Would you like some coffee?
You write what you know.
In the beginning.
Then I got to like what he did for me.
Like I say.
What kind of talk?
Do you remember his name?
What's this about anyway?
He was walking home from work.
He was I.
He probably asked her about it.
Come on I'll drive you in this thing.
You want me to drive you?
I'm just not.
I'm not afraid of her.
I feel fine!
What in the hell for?
I went over last night too.
I know what that's like.
She want to play?
I can play.
Well hell son it's got a certain ring to it I'll say that.
You think I --
What is it you got between you?
She's coming after me.
They never even got a statement from her.
It's my first drink in three months.
How'd it go son?
I never heard of him.
He's got heart.
All we did was write her name down.
I want to hear you say it again.
She knew nobody would but it.
She knew I'd say she did it.
And she knew nobody would buy it.
Sit in the sun.
Get her out of your system.
It's part of her game.
What about her parents?
That's why she asked to take it.
What now what?
She asked anybody.
So what do we do -- nothing?
Do you want to know what it's about?
I said keep it.
That's the last time anybody saw him.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
On what basis?
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Only if you're making it.
Can you check again?
Did you check all four years?
How old was she when this happened?
I'm her -- friend.
Why do you think he's dead?
What about the shit they write?
It's one of the few times I feel good.
That I got sick of.
Do you ever get sick of it?
See ya in an hour.
It's always how you would do it.
I'd take some of them out.
How was yours?
When's your show?
Is this finished yet?
Hey  it's the big A.
Should I have?
Have you heard of me?
It's in New York.
He's just using you.
We can do better.
It needed more white.
I wanted to make a few more of these.
It makes a good green.
Well have you asked her to come back?
I still think about her.
Do you still love her?
It's really great.
They work really well.
Yeah  I'd do that...
Stop giving them away.
Should we buy it for five thousand?
Yeah I met her already.
Your show looks great.
You can do anything!
First time I've heard of that!
I can give you five.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You should talk to him about this.
How much for these five?
These are great.
How about right now?
Maybe I could find a place for you to work.
Take my card.
I'd love to see some more of your work...
Just look at him.
Cut it out man!
Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr.
I'll get it back to you in an hour.
This is the one I absolutely have to have.
I really love it.
I can get ten.
We could talk about it.
I have some other stuff to show him.
I hear your show was sold out already.
Should there be?
One last thing.
Let's talk about that....
I'm not black.
Well you said that.
It looks good like that.
Where do you take your words from?
Yes I understand  but where do you take them from?
They're just words.
What do they...
I hate this.
Turn that off.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
See that table over there?
I'd like to pay their bill.
What's wrong with you today?
You want me to put it here?
 In this corner?
Still not here.
Like health food.
I'm taking care of my health!
Come on let's get out of here.
She's good.
That's not how I meant it.
You can never tell.
Check you later man.
You're doing something.
Just do your shit like you do it!
What else do you want?
So then what?
It takes two days.
Just do what you do.
Follow your heart.
To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Oh  you mean black people!
You got a date already?
Your dad called again  something about a job.
I knew I left these somewhere.
Here  I made this for you.
You hear what I'm doing?
People read him.
Tell him who you are..
I thought I was one.
Baby I think about you a lot.
I'm really sorry about everything.
You have to believe me.
What's that about?
Pretty much the same.
Why does everybody say that?
A present I picked up for you.
You're your own baby.
You look fucking beautiful beautiful.
You want some?
I'm your family.
I had to go see my family.
It's not Sunday?
It's Monday morning.
What who's saying?
Do you know what he's saying?
I'll buy you some new ones.
How could you do that to me?
They're beautiful now.
I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
I just said that.
I was never here before.
I actually like it.
Too many party girls.
You definitely do.
Can I walk you home?
Yeah it's the best one.
Is that the best quality you have?
Want a job?
What's your name man?
You made it.
Some of them.
Your hair was different.
How can I ever thank you?
"" Think about it.
You have someone to live for.
Life's beautiful.
talk to me.
That's a beautiful name.
I'm only here on business.
I'll make you another one.
Believe that shit.
After the show.
I'll take it tonight.
That one's for you.
You're news.
I write it down.
But when I write it down people know it's true.
I can put you in the ring with him.
So what's your real name?
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I'm really just starting to find myself.
You're just like I used to be.
I'm forty-one.
Hold this please.
You'll get there.
I've got like five of 'em!
I need this?
Let him order?
You on his side?
You get out too.
Let him order.
Come what may...
Yes I suppose that we did.
No no here's what to do just tell her...
let her know that I...
No, actually I feel worse.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Supposed to be cold, right?
No, nothing, ah...
But explain me...
A ""he-man""?
I'm -- sorry I --
I'm a woman...
Where's the fire?
What're you really after?
Must feel pretty good.
Hey good to meet you.
Till we figure it out let's...
When he should be six feet under?
So why'd you come tonight?
What say we...
Sorry about yesterday...
How can I put this.
Hang on I think I know...
You kept things from her.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all but...
Yes and no...
No that's be me and me.
Is that what I said?
You're not coming to that are you?
The news these days...
Well I could...
free up some time...
Well that's a...
We've met.
It does to me.
I am the light of this city.
Good time too.
One way to find out?
Let's make a deal.
I gave at the office.
I want in.
You're quick.
Oh him again.
He's already history -- check it out.
You see we've got something in common.
But who could've...
Fact they're kind of turned around now...
Okay you have a point.
I'm the one you want!
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.
Point is listen to them.
I got my own...
I need you now.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
You know what Mr.
And once we're both back home perhaps we can help each other out...
Most of all I want to find out who I am.
Well it's not working.
What do you think this is a conversation?
You're home in bed.
Take a ""personal day.
Actually it's a lot like that.
And a very very good one.
I'm no cat.
And it was.
No I am.
The boys need help.
Take it child.
You look so like your mother.
Give him This.
Too late for what dear child?
I was too late.
As I've missed you.
You certainly will not.
And quite well it seems.
Thanks to you son.
Thanks to you all.
Coming on line now sir.
Right here sir.
And remember it always.
And I love you too son.
I love you old man.
I just want to say...
No my boy.
I'm afraid none of us can.
Why yes actually.
Is there something wrong sir?
After all she's family.
Oh but sir.
So much goes on-
Well I hope you'll stay with us.
That's the first time in thirty years.
For that is the nature of family.
I'm on break from-
Hey what's your problem?
I'll get you the rest.
Whatever you say lady.
It's all in a day's work for me.
I could have made it you know.
I'm so sorry to trouble you but-
Please be looking for me.
What exactly are you doing?
Be ready for anything.
I'm afraid to ask.
This is easy.
Nothing but air.
There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.
We've got work to do.
She knows who we are.
You have some real issues with women you know that?
Can he save her?
How did you...?
I'm totally over her.
She's definitely part of this.
I can make it.
How about nice to see you?
And today you are?
But perhaps tonight over dinner...
Thank you all.
I see you knew him.
We cut our support.
Actually I already work for you.
What can I do for you Doctor?
Her or me.
it was like I could feel you in the room.
The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
If you're..
You'll make someone a good husband one day.
Here's some food for thought.
Okay here goes.
You're not even listening to me.
Can I get some help over here?
DO you remember?
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.
To keep her for yourself.
And she did it all for me.
Oh but I am.
For the first time in a long time.
You're not thinking straight.
Look at us.
You just want her for yourself.
Like hell you do.
No one else is even close.
Maybe for the first time in my life.
He'd never say Anything.
But I can tell.
And I've never told him.
But he's never said a word-
Maybe it's something in the water.
What happened to his wife?
For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Just what I had in mind.
A chance for mother nature to start again.
But why stop there?
There was nothing I could do.
Where is my wife?
Make yourself right at home.
There's someone I want you to meet.
So I'm here to set you free.
What is it with men?
To never change.
I've got to stop him.
Tell me your plan.
I want us to be together.
Give it up.
I think I've had a change of heart.
Especially for a dead woman.
Without your research I could never have come this far.
What exactly are you working on in there?
What do we have here?
Tonight's a good night.
How about MR.
What do they mean?
You are a kind man.
A strong man.
There's one other thing.
But all this.
Give me the bad news.
Not that young.
It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Why not ask the lady?
She's the first woman in a long time that's...
She's the first woman ever.
Have a life.
Why do I keep doing this?
Which `they' might that be sir?
Maybe they're right.
I shall be near at hand.
Should you need me.
And sir I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Actually he took the car.
Sorry to bother you sir.
You said I.
It's happening again.
Just like my parents.
Take any three you like.
Your dear parents.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
She has an excellent mind.
I think they're getting worse.
What's back there?
You like strong women.
We could give it a try.
My life's an open book.
Less to take off.
What is it about the wrong kind of man?
It's the car right?
By the way do you have a first name?
I read your work.
I see without seeing.
When all this could have been ours together.
And you are...
I need you!
We'll talk some other -
Call my secretary she'll set something up.
Keep up the good work.
But what exactly is on your mind?
Just like I tell everyone.
There's something I need to tell you--
I made them go out.
You do know.
What does the book say?
I'm so small.
The book is in my hands.
They're trying to break through.
Try to remember-.
There's something I want to talk with you about.
In a sense we are all two people.
I'm not-
Why do you do that?
This is what I do for a living.
Why do I feel like the other man here?
Find anything interesting?
They've changed.
I said I'm sure he did.
He sure did.
I think he felt it too.
You just moved here.
Well I met someone...
How about coming along?
I'm easy.
That's usually my line.
Work better for you?
Usually at night.
Does it ever shut off?
Just ones this beautiful.
How can I help you Mr.
All this has to be a choice.
But what about all the good we can do?
What am I talking about?
This conversation is over.
I need a name.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
I want better for you.
Back off man.
Two-Face took...
Now I can pay him back.
I need to be part of this.
It'll make it worse.
Where will you go?
Do you remember me?
Of course you are.
Extra well done.
What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else?
Your mind of course.
The main course.
I'll show you it works.
Not that someone like you would need it.
You said you'd let me go!
That floor has got to be very hard.
I got family.
You can say it.
Why do we need you?
You only come between us.
Not until you do that thing I like.
Hit us again.
Just Say No.
Until I say yes.
A man with a death wish.
It's so you.
How'd you find us?
Pass that on to Mr.
The small one.
I'd say about thirty feet sir.
How high up would you say that is?
If not for you I never would've made it.
It seems like yesterday.
there'll never be another one like you.
Where's the boy?
You know we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart.
You made me what I am today.
Let the boy go.
Is this what you wanted?
Who's close to you?
What it must have cost.
We'd all be dead.
They've got it all wrong.
So did I once.
But I kept coming back and...
They're afraid of the lights.
Many years ago.
How'd you find this place?
It's not on the market yet.
What is this stuff?
-- What's that?
How long have I been out?
I'll take you with me.
But this is my job.
And you were as good as dead.
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Well -- I think you might consider
A hundred and eight?
Too many people.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Yeah a drink.
but she's in love with you.
That's all I want man.
I just want your word.
-- I've read your work.
I quite like it.
Do you love half of me?
Or all of me?
In all these years...
This house and the money and the power...
It was never mine.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Keep her on the line!
The does it.
It's like the last time.
He sent me a present before he --
-- What if I could save one?
You're one man.
You can do so much good for people.
No one would miss me.
We have to --!
I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
I wish you'd...
the way things have gone between us...
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today.
I'd like to make it up to you.
I know it's late.
I -- Are you there?
Not even dinner.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.
And I did -- And here we are.
We could try that.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
But it's not fair.
that's how I'll mean it.
As much as I do.
If you train yourself to look for it.
Of course I never saw what was really happening there.
Too much work.
As far as I know.
We've told him we'll deal.
He'll be ready when you do.
They'll be sorry.
I want his head!
We got 'em!
About how pretty you are pretty boy.
Maybe he'd like to know --
You should be thinking about the future.
our problems are your problems.
I'm on top of it.
If there's a problem --
Now shut up!
My brother says...
all the bad things you done...
That's the best part.
I've died once already.
Is that what you ""heard""?
I heard you'd been --
Okay a break-in.
And what happens if we say no?
Just tell us what you expect.
I want ten million and one.
Here's the deal.
I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
You DID THAT to her!
I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
A before-and- after kind of thing.
And you want a --
DID YOU SEE THAT?!
We've got to find some way to tell him!
Let's head for the lights.
Where is it??
he wants to tell me.
His face was on it.
He knew that -- And he let me keep.
I was right!!
And they know him.
They would know.
No place to change.
Are they paying you for all this?
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
I do this for a living.
There's a phone.
Which is how he goes through women.
He called you up and asked you for a date?
Well he must like the way he looks.
I was thinking.
Well you know me.
The more they've got the less they're worth.
You actually know all these people?
Small so far.
Big or small?
Oh it's too good.
And not a happy one.
He's not too bad.
I can live with him.
Here let me do that.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
We're not...
Let's get a coffee.
Nothing ever really changes does it David?
Sort of half.....
Now what does that mean?
Why do you wear it?
most of the time these days.
David I'm serious!
It's not a problem...
Let's just sit...
There's no one out here.
I need some time David.
A little time.
It's not just you.
What's wrong with you David?
Did you really ask?
That's exactly what I said...
It's the last thing we need.
He's a doctor of er...
Do we know anything about him?
I said I'd check with you.
They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.
And they asked me if we'd like to...
put him up for a while.
Life's too short.
There's a call for you.
It's your wife.
He's ready to see you upstairs.
I can understand THAT.
Right first time.
Oh right yeah.
Oh Jesus God.
Seems to be a problem with the door.
Where's the picture gone?
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Everything okay David?
Yes look I wanted to talk to you about this.
That's where this...
You'll hear soon enough.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
well she's good.
he's kind of his own guy you know?
So what am I saying?
Will we find her again?
Okay that'll do.
We have to be totally ready then.
I'd like you to meet some of our staff here.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.
Love to sir but no can do.
I'm er...
sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Say that again son.
I've got a lot of time to make up.
Maybe two cars.
David David David...
Quite right sir.
Let's put on a good show tomorrow shall we?
I think you're wrong David.
She looks as fine as she's ever looked.
no no hold on...
In fact I'll go right now.
Thank you David.
David what else can I do?
Yes although I really.....
Yes it's great to have him with us.
Very pleased you've taken him in David.
He certainly has something sir.
Looking forward to it.
You have a problem with that?
on the other hand...
Oh look I mean it's kind of the last thing...
I mean I'd really like to but...
There's a man.
it's okay...
No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Not my place sir.
Then where would we be?
Not in one piece anyway.
like my own dear mother.
It could have been worse.
how we do things in this family.
Please - talk to me.
Well there is that...
That's one - way of looking at it.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Yes it is...
Why thank you sir.
I wish I could use that at school.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
What do you think it is Dad?
Yeah he had a lot of problems.
I always thought there was something wrong with him.
Not this time!...
Well where is she?!
I'll go right after you.
I have a couple.
I think I'm seeing something too.
It's like a really long time ago...
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something...
Are we almost there?
It's all hot and stuff.
Is this the right bus?
That's not that much.
You mean like this?
Yeah it's just the same thing over and over again.
So like where is she?
I want the window.
I'm ready for love.
Are we like doing it?
This is what it's all about.
Yeah we should party.
Soon she will be mine.
Wait I wanted her to do it.
We'll do it sir.
We'll do your wife.
Yeah but check it out.
Let's have a drink on it.
Sorry to hear that.
Why it's you two.
You'll have to speak up son.
We'll get you whatever you want.
We might need him.
We've got him.
We should've found him by now.
the White House!
I want everyone there.
What the hell...?
That bus we picked up.
Well sir it's not good.
Cut the power!
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Here have a look.
She sure does.
It's black about this big.
I need ya to bring it back.
It's real important.
Any questions so far?
Here she is.
Oh well as long as you can get the job done.
So what are your names?
What's your last name dear?
Jim I want you to meet two nice boys.
Well then you know what I'm talking about.
Anyway here's the story.
That's where we're from.
I got a better deal for ya.
I'll double it.
He said we could do you.
Who sent ya?
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?
So do I Jane.
Give or take a year.
A real live little girl.
She needs us.
Maybe that's why we died so young to keep us from getting so...
You can build another one...
missed out on some love that's all...
all the hard stuff is the same over here.
and over here -- it's...
If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
Have you ever been to...?
We've got him where we want him.
Maybe they'll leave now.
We're getting better at this stuff.
We can work something out ourselves.
We need help.
She's only fourteen...
I'll break them.
Has anything been simple so far?
What an awful name.
I thought it was like -- you know.
Yes this must be him.
Here's something.
Then it should be here.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
I feel really stupid.
Practice practice practice.
Look she's right.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
Look at this everything is different down here.
My God we're back where we started.
We need some help.
I found something this morning.
what are you looking up?
There's nothing we can do.
That's all we need.
That little girl saw us.
No I'm not putting up with this.
I hate these people.
'  Wait a minute.
Where are all the other dead people in the world?
Why is it just you and me?
There are a thousand things...
I hate it when I'm not in control.
Here's one.
Anything happen while I was away?
That's how long you were gone.
We're home.
In our own house.
I am sitting.
Yeah it turned out okay.
That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Let's not think about it.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
She's ready.
So can I?
I got an A!
My father bought this place.
So that you'll move out.
And this used to be your house I bet.
I'd finish it too but...
Nobody else can.
You can actually see us?
I'd say three hours.
Wait for who?
So what's my cut?
Do what you know.
We only help those who help themselves.
Just do a little at a time.
And of course practice practice practice.
Get 'em out yourself.
It's your house.
Hell is other people.
Are you available?
I was out.
Every dog has his day.
This is my town.
I'm at your service.
Just get some people out of our house.
You're the dead.
We've got some serious talking to do.
He does not work well with others.
we have trouble.
He was one of my boys.
From day one...
But I must be off...
-- Like you used to be?
I'd nearly given up on you.
I was about to leave.
I told them no way.
You and your father and mother can stay too.
Life is just...
I want to be dead too.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Of course I can see you.
it's just too big for you two.
I know these things.
This house is too big.
It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
That's right Jane.
But you're...
You've got to help them.
You're ready for me now?
They'd look silly on me.
I'm fourteen years old!
I can do it if I get out.
Now you said it twice; just one more time and I'll be free.
Say my name three times.
I'll be all yours.
Well yes of course.
It's great over here.
I want to get in.
All I want is to get out.
No I mean they've gone.
Of course they're dead.
I've come for the last time.
Just keep me out of it.
Yes of course you are.
And it certainly is.
Not these people!
I think she's in with them.
do something with them?
They're not here!
and the business plan.
Now let's get back to business.
I can make history here!
Answer your mother.
They do what they want.
Well this is...
Go help your mother.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Anyway this can wait.
I was just trying to open the door.
Where is your mother?
They're already dead.
Yeah yeah we'll think on it.
Listen think right about it will you?
I'm sorry already.
All right you dead people!
I love them.
I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.
Any particular kind?
I say let's keep it the way it is.
What's happening to them?
Oh they're still here.
What's on the third floor?
Oh as long as we're here...
He'll love whatever you do to it.
I thought I saw something.
The rest of the house is probably worse.
When can you and I get started?
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
How's school?
It'll open any door in that house.
Will you give it to your father?
In case he needs advice in that area.
Come see me.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
They're just like you and me.
They're nice people!
A place where they live so to speak.
In a day or two yes.
Yes I suppose that's true.
I have seen it before.
It happens to old people.
Hell yes - walk.
I would like to walk today.
It's five of you'd best get on in there.
He wants me to meet the President.
You've heard?
I know about the President.
But it's not bad.
Please sit in the chair.
Yes I could stay here.
In fact it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two if that would be would be possible.
You're a very funny man Mr.
But not for long...
I've seen it done before.
I feel all right...
to take care of things...
Turn over please.
And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.
That is so true.
Quite different than most men.
To everyone I'm afraid.
It's happening across the country!
I think we'd better go look for him.
I wish he were here...
Do you think we should look for him?
He walked off...
But he's...?
At times yes.
Yes he is different...
Is that necessary?
How is Mr.
Of course Doctor I understand.
So please not a word.
Well he said it was his he walked us through it.
I have no idea...
Please hold still Mr.
I've never seen anything like this on television.
Now hold still.
Are you looking for something?
I would like to be on that show.
Yes I have seen that show on television.
Would you care to take it sir?
We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
You set me free.
But I've never done...
When I do it?
Is that all you want...?
To watch me...?
I like to watch.
I was with a man.
We went upstairs.
I love you and I want you...
That could be true.
I want us to be...
I want us...
You and I to become...
I want us to become very close you know...?
I like you to be here.
Do you mind my being here like this?
I like the President.
He is a very nice man.
I know you do - you and your television...
I like to watch too.
We'll both be watching.
Yes so do we.
Oh I like that very much.
YOU mentioned that she had gone were you close to her also?
You must have been very close to him.
Last night you mentioned an old man that died.
He's very nice.
How did you like meeting the President?
Oh I know exactly what you mean.
This is fine.
Is there anything special you would like to watch?
Well I'm very sorry...
Did you lose something?
Well they're just a wonderful couple we've been friends for years.
Pardon me was that Mr.
My name is Chance.
May I ask your name?
I would like to watch television.
David we'll just go on home.
Your family doctor?
Say would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Why yes he is...
Why there certainly is.
Please let us take you.
There's no need for a hospital.
Then one more quick question Mr.
Yes that is correct.
I think you should ask Mr.
The President is a nice person.
I'm not busy.
It's a very good show.
Do you realize Mr.
Of course Mr.
Give me your foot!!
Do you need a doctor?
Yes I do it's very good.
Are you sure you like it?
Yes very well thank you.
Can you see well?
We must speak again Mr.
A beautiful name my friend!
I like that name very much.
Would you tell me your name again please?
Yes it is very good!
Do you think so?
I certainly do.
And we are both down before our time you see?
We are not far...
We may find my friend that we are not so far from each other not so far!
Yes I agree I think so too.
and I've felt love...
Tell her that...
I would like to do that.
there's much to be looked after...
Yes that's good...
You know what I was talking to you about last night?
It was nice talking to the President.
Maybe one day...
Well that's good news my boy.
Well I can understand that.
Just give it some thought work with the idea I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes I'm sure it is.
That's what they say anyway.
All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
The garden that I left was such a place.
I would like to work in your garden.
Do we have a garden?
That's good Mr.
So am I my boy - so am I.
You look very sick.
I like that very much.
I feel very good in here.
Oh you can tell her later.
Well if that's what you want then I want it too.
We can go this way.
I like to watch very much.
You mean just watch me?
We could do it now we can go upstairs.
Please it's time for us.
What sort of bed is it?
Sure you do!
No one has the time to read!
I have trouble writing a post card to my children!
Right this way sir.
Did you wish to see someone sir?
May I help you Mr.
They all fit me very well.
Of men and women.
I never needed money.
Chance I'm very pleased to meet you.
You can take me.
I would like to look.
Let's have a look do you mind?
It seems to be.
That is a very small room.
How long do we stay in here?
No - but Mr.
Does it have a television?
I have seen it often.
Is that all you got to say?
It's very white.
I've seen that done.
He's dead Chance!
The Old Man's dead!
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short but before we close I'd like to ask one final question.
The bad as well as the good?
Yes I know the garden very well.
I have worked in it all my life.
The garden needs a lot of care.
I know that Mr.
Come now Mr.
Fine then let's get started.
Of course you know Mr.
I think you do Mr.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
He has one just like it.
Do you drive this Mr.
You have me I am here.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden.
He would read and rest there.
Chance that was twenty-seven years ago.
I remember when he came.
No I do not have any of those.
How were you paid?
I have always been here.
I have always worked in the garden.
Since you were a child?
Ever since I can remember since I was a child.
But she should have left earlier today...
I'm waiting for my lunch.
Are you waiting for someone?
Wonderful we'll all look forward to seeing you.
I'd like to say hello.
Yes I see...
Could you go through that one more time please Mr.
In the garden?
Are we finished?
I said - try again.
Sure try again - where?
Do you need a secretary?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Good I'd like to meet a reasonable man.
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
No it's been a good day - better than yours from what I've been told.
Other than that I'm doing very well.
I'll be with Mr.
Let's let the men talk there are so many people that have been asking about you.
And look who you brought with!
How nice of you to come.
I can certainly understand that...
It's not that I just...
Is there something I've done?
Maybe you should talk to somebody darling.
I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
He's getting to that age you know...
How are the kids getting along?
What do you make of all this?
Before I was born...
I said good night!
He does talk like one but I think he's brilliant.
Take this down.
What do you mean there is nothing?
What have you found?
But we'll keep on top of it Mr.
President - we'll come up with the answer.
So what does all that add up to?
Where the hell is it?
This information goes back three days.
I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.
That could be possible...
You're right Mr.
She'll be sorry to have missed you.
President I'd like you to meet my dear friend Mr.
Here sit down get off your feet.
President how good to see you.
Great to see you!
I'm pretty sure it was you.
It's for....
oh what the hell it's for me!
Who am I thinking of?
Tell your friends.
Thousand times thank you!
Please say no!
When you say I can be somebody else what do you mean exactly?
I just want you to know that.
You'll have me after all I've done to you?
There's a small community of us.
We're happy.
We'll keep trying to figure out a way.
Come stay with us.
You saw it once.
Now you see it again.
And yourself too in the process.
God you're so beautiful.
It all worked out in an odd sort of way.
I'm sorry for everything.
A better friend.
As long as you're happy.
He's a lucky man.
Do I know him?
I'm in love.
For the first time.
It's funny but when it happens to you there's no question.
You look really wonderful.
Oh God I'm sorry.
Too much has happened.
What the hell darling.
Tell her you need to see her.
How could they know?
I have to go away now.
Me and John.
And he was with her.
Us of course.
I'm giving them up.
I've lost interest.
Let's try to work this out.
We've got so much history.
I'm moving.
Oh you know not a lot.
So how was it?
What was he doing?
I have to go back tonight.
At eight Exactly.
Everything felt right for the first time.
Is this her?
I knew who I was.
We'll do it right now.
I want to try.
I'll be in in a little while.
I'll be in soon.
A little while.
How was your evening?
It was just you know hard to get away.
Sorry I'm so late.
I can get us out of it if you want.
Just an idea I had.
Yeah just an idea I had.
They'll understand.
We have to make it an early night.
What time are they supposed to be here?
He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
We've been over this.
maybe you'd feel better if you got you know a job or something.
For the love of God.
What exactly did you...
I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Let me try!
being you actually.
He said what I said!
This is too good to be true.
I'm afraid I...
have no idea what you are saying...
Whatever you said.
You're not like the other boys we've had here.
You suggest what?
I think that's what he said.
I said ""yes.
I'm sorry I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
There are others.
So we'll still be seeing each other.
And what sort of business will this be?
No sir not at all.
No thank you sir.
yes the little door.
That's sounds fine sir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday.
Imagine a room full of women.
I'll keep that in mind sir.
One hundred and five.
Lot's of it.
every fifteen minutes.
Why is this floor so short?
George Will I think.
Okay put these in order.
You think so eh?
She's not my secretary.
No it's okay sir.
Come in Mr.
I'd stand but well you know.
Be all that someone...
How the hell would I know?
Of course right this way Mr.
Let him try.
Phone it in.
Ever want to be someone else?
Now you can.
End of the world!
I'll do it myself.
Am I me?
There's only one thing to do.
What's he been in?
I've never felt this before for anyone not even my wife.
Please let me explain.
You're not someone I could get interested in.
But enough about me.
You're late I walk.
Somebody told you.
Nobody told me!
It's a beautiful name.
It was meant to be!
Who told you?
I'm right?
I think you're on to something.
Ha ha ha!
I'll be with you always my friends.
If there was any way I could go in your place.
I'm the only one.
If not me who?
A thousand times yes!
My second choice.
Ah this is wonderful.
Too good to be true!
Man about town!
Can I be anyone I want?
Tell me the plan.
Why are you being like this?
I love a good plan.
But I think I have another plan.
Oh he's good!
It almost went well.
That's the best I can think of right now.
Those are hard.
Nice to meet you all.
Yes my dear?
It's my job to ask the questions.
Yours to answer them.
All the better.
I tell you that as a friend.
I'm done with her now.
Now that's hot.
Let me know when you're done with her.
it was like nothing I've...
It's like nothing I've ever felt before.
But of course.
I need to get in there!
That is not allowed.
My God you are supposed to be one of us.
You look terrible my dear.
Oh be still my heart.
Well you know he's quite good.
I'll speak with you soon.
It's been him!
Oh God it's been him!
We have to meet.
It's business hours.
I have to see you.
Be all that someone else can be.
But we're getting to the bottom of it.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
And the funny thing is.
I mean him.
""Ever want to be someone else?
It's got everything.
What's the play?
She's not available.
Yeah I saw them
I saw your show.
They love me darling!
""  The New York Times.
Sorry dear I lost control for a minute.
What if everybody knew?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
We're trying to think here.
I like that about it.
You're right my darling it's so much more.
It's playing with people!
You're brilliant!
I'd love to see your work.
I'll say you are.
I'm getting better all the time.
How did you know it was me?
We're over.
Something was making me talk.
I'm not talking.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Then what do I do?
But you said...
what was that word?..
There was a boy there...
Seeing the other children.
I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
""These things too will pass"".
What you looking for?
You still know.
Was a time I knew what was.
You saying God give up?
That what you saying?
That what you're doing?
What world are you talking about?
But you got to do it.
You have to be there.
That's the last thing they took from me.
What you was put here to speak.
Say the Word!
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Here let me carry that.
See this mark?
Her little hands...

What'd be the point?

At other times I think she was...
But who would know that better than you.
Says she can feel it.
She gone like they say?
You think I should stop by?
Your mother all right?
More than all right.
You on your way home?
Well is it now?

Where'd she been?
And report back to us as soon as it's done.
Her life is in your hands.
Here's the money and the phone.
They called about eighty minutes ago.
One person only or I'd go with you.
They were very clear on that: one person only.
Why me man?
We've had some terrible news.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Her parents want her back.
Who're you working for?
Hey man I'm not--
She's not my special lady she's my fucking lady friend.
Show me what you got.
Come and get it.
Yeah but we're--
They range up to three thousand.

Am I wrong?
What can they do?
Oh yeah how'd it go?
That makes me fucking SICK!
I've had a--
Jesus man can you change the station?
But you know me.
You never went to college?
Think he's got room for one more?
--without  the means  for higher education so Mr.
These are Mr.
We were very--
And this picture was taken when Mrs.
That is indeed Mr.
And what do you do sir?
And was there anything of value in the car?
Oh hey man how are ya?
Far from it.
I like the way you do business.
of half a million.
That's your business.
All I'm saying is I want mine.
I thought you might know man.
Of course you do get the good with the bad.
On you maybe.
Like you man!
THAT'S NOT--
So your father.
Oh man I get it!
I want a child.

Well yes what did you think this was all about?
He has no money of his own.
But he's--
I'm real fucking close to your father's money real fucking close.
It's just--
Why did he think you had it?
And who does?
He thought I had your father's money so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
What happened to your house?
And then you know little of this little of that.
Not much to tell.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
for about twenty years.
--I mean you know him?
Now I got--
You might learn something.
She most certainly was not!
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.
Yeah but what about--
Well--sure I could do that--
Yeah but my-
You can imagine where it goes from here.
Take a look at this sir.
Yes I know about it.
In a sense yes.

Just ask him if he--ask him about the car man!
Look man did you--
Yeah go figure.
All but one man died?
No I'm--
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
My point is--
You seem to know the answer to everything else!
What about that poor woman?
What do we tell--
You're the one who's so fucking certain--
You said so yourself--
Oh him yeah.
We're not fucking around!
Your plan is so fucking simple I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!
We throw the money out of the moving car!
Where's the hand- off?
They'll call back.
Her life was in our hands!
It is a fucking game.
Yes you're wrong.
You said you just wanted to come along--
Have they called yet?
The fucking point is--
The point is--
What if it's during a game?
Just for making the hand-off?
With a record.
Am I wrong!
No you're not wrong--
I did not know that.
--Over the line!
You're fucking twenty minutes late.
No she she hit me right here.
So no funny stuff.
But only if there is no funny stuff.
Where do you want us to go?
Help me put him back in his chair.
All right get out.
Well you have your story I have mine.
Well she's back.
No thanks to you.
Well okay if you've already made out the check.
Well sure look at it!
I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit man!
HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
She is the light of my life.
Whatever the price?
What makes a man Mr.
That's your answer!
Your answer to everything!
My wife is not the issue here.
I do mind.
This will not stand ya know this will not stand man.
Is this a--what day is this?
Look let me explain something.
I'm not Mr.
So that's what  you  call me.
I'll say it again.
I'll say it again all right?
So where do I fit in?
You and these women!
Shit sorry man.
I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Let me tell you something else.
I said out.
I'll tell you who I am!
Who the hell is he?
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?
Am I wrong!?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
I came all the way down here same as you did.
How does it look?
Well it's in mine too.
I was born this way.
Why do you hate us so much?
If that's true then why'd you save me?
Anyone else make it?
""Each day is a little life.
Each day is a little life.
Let's do this NOW!!!
What are we supposed to do then?
He's right about one thing.
I've never seen anything like this.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
We need it.
So we have to take it to the next level.
Just remember why you're here.
Where to first?
So let's get it over with.
You've been training two years to take me out.
So do it.
Talk to me!
Then who does he work for?
Where the hell have you been?
I'm not giving you a choice old man.
What do you really think?
Sounds like a plan.
I'll be watching you close.
Took you long enough.
Thought you were dead.
And so will we.
Too bad you're out of it.
One I was on to you the moment they turned you.
Like how little?
From his father of course.
Where did he learn that?
You've already lost two of your own.
Two so far.
What's up with your hair anyway?
You little shit.
When did they get to you?
After last night?
You're not coming?
What about you though?
Back then we did not.
And for what?
Look what's your problem?
Just be quick about it will you?
Do it right.
You have to -- finish me off.
Just do it old man.
You can help her.
You sure now?
They're afraid of you.
You always have been.
How can you be out here?
But I just got here --
How do I stop it?
Hold out your hands.
There are other ways to see.
Is something wrong my friend?
But for me --
Get out of here --
I've been better --
For what it's worth I'm sorry.
We've been up all night.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Is he sick?
I remember from day one.
You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Look if what you say is true if there's a chance I could turn into one of them then I've got no choice do I?
I have to work with you.
I need to learn everything I can about them.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Get over it.
But he could've --
I can go to the police.
I can show them.
You've seen one of them.
If you're stupid enough to stay that's your business.
What happens then?
You could still turn on us.
I'm sorry I --
I was afraid that might happen.
You're a week early.
Time is on our side.
I wish you could see the world as I do.
These are my people now.
I'm one of them.
How could you be a part of this?
But you -- died --
Five minutes not a second more.
Five minutes that's all I ask.
Right on time.
Which of course they do.
Get away from him!
You were never one of us.
There's no need for any of this.
But I knew better.
How many of you are there?
What happened to the power?
On me yes.
He was born with it.
Which is why you're here.
We could use someone with your experience.
You might have missed something.
It's not something he can control.
The problem is time's running out.
Go on I'll be fine!
You've been listening in the whole time?
There is one other thing.
So what do you use then?
Who are you people?
What are you alright?
What happened to her where did she go?
That's why she had to go.
Join the club.
--which she may have--
--and if she ever did--
Stop talking about it!
Been on the road since yesterday.
What're you doing there?
--he's not my husband!
Let's talk to your husband--
Something was wrong.
The main thing to remember is whatever the reason it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Any number of reasons--pick one it's as good as the other.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with.
That's its name.
Oh sorry right.
This is funny??
I'll see you in fucking court!!
What's she look like?
Oh, Jesus, no--
--what're you saying??
--no, what's wrong with you?
I want to see something!
--no, you're not.
You love me too much.
--you should get back into bed.
We've looked at half of one tape.
But if that's all we've got left--
You said the name James.
--fine later fine.
Why is there no ""our"" here?
Your body your call.
Somebody like to explain that to me?
--whatever; that's her.
We're both in a world of shit here!!
I know you're in there you piece of shit!
--no one'll ever know.
--Christ they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
Four in the morning?
Who do you know who can?
Where do we go?
That made her lose the baby?
Oh who did then?
Just sort've saw 'em there.
How'd you know they were--
--no I think they're all in there.
You want a hand?
Goes right along with these two.
--one of us all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here.
--I saw what I saw.
Down there in the Park.
Not a great idea.
What about night?
--coming out of the water--
--yeah a hand or something--
What're you doing with all this shit?
We should be so lucky.
Try a long walk.
No sense at all.
Made no sense.
--it's less than four feet just--
Just let it go I've got you!
Just hold on!
All the shit that was worth anything yes.
There's something somebody here I want to see 'em coming.
I think it's time to get out of here.
No one's been in or out since you left.
It's not a real ""funny"" time for us okay?
--whatever you want no problem--
All I need--
--and none of 'em were mine!
I'll get on it.
--and we brought it back with us!
That's almost a year's worth of work!
Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
What is all this shit?
When you get back I'll try to make sense of it for you.
I'll have to go out.
I know I know--
Still working on it.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
He'll never know.
Then I have no idea.
You're needed here--keep watching--
She's far from ""fine.
And then the other.
We're all a little--
Could I have him--
What happened to my Dad??
For you I answer the door.
Well I do...
I think someone's watching.
You wanted to get your money.
Where is everything?
That's what's important.
Anyway we got some time now.
I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right.
I took care of everything.
You called me this morning.
I said you're bad.
You're bad.
Okay see ya...
I better get off now.
It's early...
you all right?
Yeah he told me once himself.
He said to me...
He's real careful.
Well I'd be okay in here--
So how do you know it was a he?
Was it for you?
See a guy.
I own the place.
It'll pass.
So what're you doing tonight?
About ten years.
I just wanted to see if you knew.
If he does come in I'm not here...
I reckon I can hear him.
I reckon I can hear him...
Where're you from?
What night is it?
What's tonight?
What was that back there?
You know that car?
Well now you do.
See I never knew that.
I'll figure something out...
But I like you.
Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him.
Like maybe he's sick?
Or is it maybe me do you think?
I want that money.
Then what'd you come here for?
Having a good time?
I must've gone money simple.
I just made a call about that.
It'll look fine.
I've been very very careful.
Have you been very very careful?
The less you know about it the better.
So it would seem.
Got something to show me first?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Listen what is it?
Is it done?
What kind of fish?
I'll give you a call when it's done...
You just find a way to cover that money.
There's a big--
I mean real stupid.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
Got a job for you.
Test of true love--
It just made them feel better.
Most of the night...
How long did you watch her?
You called me I knew they were there so what do I need these for?
What did you take these for?
I think I'll stay right here in hell.
I thought you were dead.
I'm very careful about that.
No he's off tonight.
Where was he last night?
You been to the bar?
Not here tonight.
He's especially not back in his office.
You missed a good one though.
How many years?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
that sounds nice.
my whole family's sick.
let's drink to something else.
here they are.
look at you.
you better be.
come on in.
I was the same way when I was you age.
Right now though.
maybe something for you too.
we were just talking.
It's daddy.
I'll get you.
is that you?
but I love you.
You like to open me.
go to the police.
how could he?.
or do you just want me?
if you need to.
come to where I live.
stop saying that.
can you stand up?
can I come in?
Did I say that?.
or did I?
You said hello.
You wanted to talk to someone?.
something in an hour.
GET OUT OF THERE!!
What's your name?.
it's new stuff.
I'll tell you though.
you're okay.
to make her do things.
You like me?.
okay let's go.
what does that mean?
I like that idea.
that's a real good idea.
are they important things?
I know some things.
that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Yeah I worry.
now get this.
they know each other.
they seem to like each other.
the only trouble is.
the night I met you.
and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.
Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
also it could get you in trouble.
this is what I have found out.
they have a son.
there is another man involved.
you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door.
you know what I mean?
I've found out some things.
nothing really for certain.
Well how did it go?.
I mean call you.
it can wait till Sunday.
can I call?
Could you wait a little while.
Leave it in the front of your house for me.
an interesting experience.
that does that.
do you have a date tonight?
what's next?
sometimes in some cases.
pull over and wait a minute.
he moved away.
but it's bad enough.
it's a lot worse for my father.
they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while.
which is nice.
left his whole business and family his wife and two kids.
like I said she's not my father's case.
you're not supposed to see them.
the police are watching.
You want to see the building?.
It's close by.
and some others.
you brought it up.
What else is new?.
you're right.
You have your money.
You tell him I want my money by Friday.
He sent me.
I'm George.
One and I'm out.
I have the space.
This is what I want to do.
My brother-in-law.
Along with many others.
Let us walk.
Try the bar.
George I went to the doctor.
Let's get the check.
We'll take it.
Should we buy it?
You happy baby?
This is it for me.
Nothing like this back home.
You'll see for yourself.
That's some fucking deal.
Are you getting paid Mr.
For you and you and you.
Your responsibility is over.
And you're lucky to get that.
Why are you speaking?
He's talking about clothes.
My clothes your clothes.
What does she weight eighty pounds?
That was out of line.
It's in the past.
I'm out of the business now so forget about it.
We need to move on.
Look I'm sorry about everything.
Cut me out too.
Happy Birthday George.
It's nothing personal George.
Nice doing business with you George.
Half a million for you.
Half a million for me.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
You want to go home go.
No one else.
And I only deal with you?
That's fifteen thousand a week for you my friend.
The money is there waiting.
Here's the best part.
Yeah I know it's a lot of weight.
That's a hundred pounds a week.
Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
I know what you want.
Oh hey one more thing?
No fucking around.
No I never.
I would not do that George.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
George I am happy to see you.
How are you my brother?
Are you happy now?
Everything is alright.
There's no problem.
This never happened.
No one has to know anything about this.
Everything's okay!
Everything is not alright.
What do I do with it?
I understand you love her but it was you and me who started this.
How long have we been in business?
Was she good enough?
I love you too man.
I love you my brother do you know that?
What do you worry?
And keep only forty-percent?
We've got to put it somewhere.
There's no room.
Try the back bedroom.
Where do I put this!?
If it's sixty pounds it's three.
If it's fifty it's two-point five.
We're half a million off.
It's two-point-five George.
You do the talking.
Ah never mind.
We'll talk about it later.
Now George watch what you say.
Life is cheap here you know?
George good to see you my brother.
Thirty-six hours.
Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
I'm sitting on...
Bad news George.
What is it George?
This is only part of the business George.
A very small part.
That's my George always thinking.
Then where are we?
It is bad.
What's the matter George?
Look around you.
I have some friends I would like you to meet.
But you must.
How does this work?
When do I see you?
Everything is fine down here.
Everything is all set up.
Yeah I'm out.
Today is the day ah?
Are you out?
It's George.
I know someone there.
A hundred hundred and fifty.
We will talk of everything.
We have the time.
Getting it here is no problem.
How much can we get?
Now do you see what I am saying?
That is where you are wrong.
For us it is cheap.
It's too expensive.
No my brother.
To take nothing and make it something okay?
That is why I am in your country.
It's not only the money is it George?
I have seen it in you.
What's the other one?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.
Twenty-six months?
Twenty-six months.
I have mine.
This is a happy day for me George.
In nine months I am free.
How much time do you have?
That we should talk about everything.
Not for you to worry.
What kind of project?
Just a little project.
Oh come on George.
And we must talk to each other.
So now it is your turn.
Now you will tell me okay?
You will tell me why you are here?
Not really no.
and start an i.
In how long?
They're not cheap.
Yes I got it.
Have you been getting the money I sent you?
She was very pretty.
We heard all about it.
Well you know.
Tell him George.
But I'm talking about that ring.
It's something else.
Let me tell you.
I just love it.
Of course George.
We are beautiful.
We started this George.
Are we good?
Life will take care of everybody.
It is the teacher.
It is very difficult.
You were an excellent teacher George.
But sometimes we must forget as well.
I am like you.
We must remember that life is the teacher.
You know why I'm here.
You know what I have to do.
I'm sorry about this George.
I'm not happy about this situation.
George you look terrible.
Keep them coming?
You are right.
Keep them coming.
Which is what George?
I want money.
I do not know either.
What do you want George?
That my business will never work in your country.
What do you think George?
I like to come up here.
To be one with nature.
As much as I can give you?
Let us drive.
We have much to talk about.
As much as you can give me.
I like you George.
That is good.
I can tell already.
You are like me.
I look at you and I see myself.
It's in the eyes no George?
I do not do business without him.
But never mind.
I am thinking we can do much together.
The man in the garden.
Actually it was three.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
I meant every word of it.
That was a good one Dad.
I'll tell her.
Give it to her Dad.
It'll make her happy.
You and your mother.
It's all over the news.
I'm happy right now.
No it's good.
You have a family.
It's good if it makes you happy.
It's nice to have nice things.
Are you happy son?
You're like your mother.
You love money.
Let me tell you something son.
You would have been great at anything.
I'm great at what I do Dad.
I mean I'm really great.
You know the police are looking for you.
Yeah you are.
I can tell by the way you look at me.
You want me to get your old job back?
You would have been the first one in the family.
There's something out there for me Dad.
Something free form you know?
You've got the wrong fucking guy.
And the first one's got your name on it.
How are you doing George?
What's good for us is good for him.
The set-up is wrong.
We sell it.
We move all of it.
Well check this out.
Is that what he's asking me to do?
Is she coming?
Well that's all I really wanted to say.
So okay then.
She's getting big.
Getting her own ideas.
You start paying who knows what will happen.
You're a good father George.
I always gave you that.
But you've got to talk to her.
Yeah you will.
I better see some money out of it.
I'm working on that.
Yeah so I've been thinking.
I kind of want to have her.
I've been away for so long.
Make up for the missed time you know?
You walk her to school.
I knew you'd say something like that.
Always thinking about yourself.
You put me here.
You should have taken better care of me you know?
You've been away a long time.
What is your fucking problem?
You just better do something.
Just answer the question.
What do I spend?
How will we live?
I'll talk to him tonight.
I'll do something.
Let your hair down for once.
No that's alright.
I need money.
I said I've seen it before.
But this is...
She did that before.
She's walking.
I have you.
We have the baby.
And there's nothing else.
It's just the family now.
Oh Jesus Christ George.
Put that shit away they're here.
I like fire.
You better know what you're doing George.
You're playing with fire.
My name is George.
After everything the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
You've got to know that.
It's alright Dad.
I'm sorry baby.
On my life.
At your mother's.
But I've got school.
You let me take care of your mother.
Go out there check it out see what it's like.
I've got some stuff to do this week but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.
Thursday after school.
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.
You want to come with me?
See you in the morning okay?
You can go anywhere in the world.
Yeah sure whatever.
If you could go anywhere in the world anywhere where would you want to go?
Do what you want it's a free country.
Just to walk with you.
I want to be your dad again.
You can call me Dad if you want.
I just wanted you to know I was out.
I just wanted to see you.
I love your mother.
And you are my heart.
Could I live without my heart?
We'll do that tomorrow okay?
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.
Not today George.
Time to go back.
Yes he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Have a great life.
Jesus George fifteen percent.
That's an extra two-hundred large.
You'll never fucking know.
I'll need to meet everybody.
If not we can forget we had this conversation.
Two on the ground.
Two in the air.
Actually I've got some news.
You are a man of your word.
We must be careful.
I need a lot.
You take a little and then come back.
As much as you've got.
Yeah we're good.
We're beautiful.
Start over somewhere.
That's all I needed.
You sure you know what you're doing?
It's not enough.
When there's something to move it's too easy not to.
Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
I'm really...
On my way back to school.
Yeah but what are you doing out here?
You know he's got a point.
Half this money is ours.
Twenty forty sixty eighty nine.
Twenty forty sixty eighty a thousand.
Nothing good anyway.
I never seen nothing like it.
Can you tell us something about this?
Go take a look with your own eyes.
And we were sent here for this very reason.
The questions have already been asked.
What's your question?
It depends on you.
What must I decide?
They're not paying me anything.
How much are they paying you?
Why are you afraid?
We've always been friends.
One might even say that I brought you up...
You afraid of these...?
Not you or any one of us.
And from nothing comes nothing...
Leave this to me...
And how many are we?
people who talk too much...
We must think of ourselves first.
But what's important is that you tried.
I'll explain.
With the others.
They are trying to stop the people.
Can you read?
That's true...
No they'll do even more.
We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more...
Do you understand what I mean?
Have you thought of this?
Yes I think so too...
Let's try...
Be careful now.
Tonight is out of the question.
Can we pass?
Why yes of course...
What is she saying?
By now the game is over.
But let me first see you.
Okay I'll make the statement in writing...
How can I give you this statement?
Come forward show yourself.
Who is speaking?
Take some time off.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Here it is!
No -- but I got something.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
So -- where do we start?
It could've happened to anyone.
Then you can go.
She gets it all -- everything.
What about the will?
So she knew about his heart?
Increase his heart rate.
Yes -- those of Mr.
Then how did it get into his body?
What was Mr.
But there's more?
That's what my report will read.
I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
About three hours.
Did you ever see Mr.
Could you be more specific?
What was the nature of the argument?
You get his statement?
Can I go?
I'm building a case against her remember?
I'm talking to you as a friend now.
Back off John.
This has become personal to you.
I've got work to do.
The fact that Mrs.
I would like to play it now.
Why would she want that?
John it's me remember?
Were you aware of Mr.
What did Mr.
Did you see Mr.
Tell the court about that please.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Do you know who Mr.
Why did you come by?
A little after eleven.
She was here?
Just one last question.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
About a year and half ago.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.
What did she do next Mr.
Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.
She got off on the control.
She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
Can you give the court an example?
Why do you think she left you?
She just left.
And how are you now?
I had a bad heart.
I know this is a very personal subject but could you be a little more specific?
For about one year.
-- And what did you suggest?
Did you suggest any?
What kind of information?
She was just trying to get information out of me.
We stopped seeing each other.
Yes -- several times.
Did you ever see her again after that?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
You called him?
You can suggest anything you want.
I suggest it never happened.
You'll be sorry?
Well -- as I remember it we had an argument.
Yes -- quite easy.
One last question Doctor.
Why does she come to you?
I've been seeing her for over a year.
Then -- those are not your own words?
I heard him say it.
Did you go to college Mrs.
It was his word against mine.
Yes -- he did.
Where did you meet him?
Then why did you go see Mr.
To show you this.
He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.
Why'd you come here?
What do you think I've got?
You make others believe what you want them to.
How do you think it got there?
Will you read it?
She talked him into it.
She wanted everything.
Why do you think he did that?
--and that he changed his will?
--And that Mr.
I've been to a few -- yes.
You've tried it?
I've tried it.
As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
It must have been horrible.
I suppose it's possible.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.
We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house but that was about it.
I worked for Mr.
He was a good man -- until she came along.
I need to ask you a question.
Things have changed.
I've been thinking about that.
I need to see you right away.
I've got the tape.
No -- you're not.
I do need you.
I knew you were thinking that.
I need you to believe that.
When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You've been thinking about the case?
I've thought it all out.
You can see me now.
Can I see you later?
It's only the beginning.
You were brilliant today.
I went out on the boat.
I called you all weekend.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You and me -- making love.
Yes -- it would be nice.
To let go of what you want?
That seems so far away from who you are now.
I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
No -- not at the office.
I've got a better idea.
I'll see you at the office at nine.
Yes -- she did.
Shall I tell you what you were thinking?
Oh -- Well they're different.
Is it against the law?
This is your house.
Can we get out of here?
We started talking.
In fact we talked until four in the morning.
After that we were together all the time until he left.
He used to call me every night after he came back.
I've never left.
So did this family down the road.
Did you always know you had different...
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I am who I am.
We made love together.
It was our way.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.
I gave him what he wanted.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
And the things that went on in that house.
She's waiting in the conference room.
Alright I'll talk to her
All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
I'd like you to go with her.
I'll call you later.
I know what day it is!
Get off the phone.
-- But it's Sunday.
Michael -- get off the phone.
I love you too Dad.
Well that's kind of how I am right now.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?
Hey you know better than that.
I can back it up.
That's it Mr.
This is a whole other world for her.
""  Who told you to say that?
Do it quickly Mr.
I want this to work -- but you have to help me.
You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
You think that's the answer?
You want me to make love to you?
It was a place to start.
It's more involved than that.
Please -- not now.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
It's bad enough that you are.
Can we get to the point?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
No one's asking you not to work.
I just think you could make some time for your son.
I'll talk to him later.
I can think of worse ways to go--
She sounds like quite a woman.
What's she like?
I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Some example you set.
Well I was sort of planning on...
He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
If you want me to.
Daddy -- stop it!
What time did you leave?
Well I can help.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
We're not doing it!
Well no one in my family did!
It's not that long.
Well that's a long time.
It sure has been a long time.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
It was so good to see them.
He is doing so well.
I nearly died.
I knew you'd do this!
I came to be here for you!
Oh just a old letter from a friend.
How are the kids?
You're right -- that is sick.
What about me!
Only about a thousand times.
Did we want to?
God we were so young.
I used to love this place.
I think I better.
Apparently the first Mrs.
But I thought she died.
Bar across the street.
Go back to school?
Find someone else?
Then why do you?
Not yet anyway.
Oh he did not.
He's such a nice guy.
I want to read them!
Well I'd like to read them.
Well I got news for you.
She was my mother.
That's enough for me.
Read them in order.
He was a very good man.
He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before or since.
He made me feel like a woman in a way few women maybe more ever experience...
It's hard to write this to my own children.
It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens.
But I thought it was important to give you that chance.
To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was...
How did she meet him?
Did Dad know?
How could she do that?
Well what am I supposed to think?
And now I find out she was...
She was a --!
That's what I get for moving away.
That was thirty years after daddy.
Do you think...?
He's already dead.
That's what this other letter is.
Then all it says is...
What's he saying now?
Throw it away!
Come here a minute.
I remember a Mrs.
Well there's a problem.
She's changed.
First one then the other.
I must say she's taking it well.
What do you know about ""the changes""?
Oh that'll be nice.
No leave it.
You want me to call the doctor?
Go to him.
I've met someone.
It's our last day together.
I said I'm taking a sick day.
Eat at the dinner.
Have you heard from Richard?
How's the fair?
God it's hot.
We'll leave it for now.
We're not making any decision.
Maybe you'll change your mind.
and you'll change your mind.
We have some time.
Let's not say any more now.
I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life.
All I can do is try to hold onto to both.
But now that you have it -
Not even yourself.
You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody?
What we feel for each other?
How much we feel?
And I'll feel it every minute we're together.
It could get better.
It'll all change.
If I leave what does that say to her?
You told me that.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years.
And the kids...
Then he can move!
They'll never be able to live through the talk.
Richard will never be able to.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Well go to hell!
No one's asking you to!
You have no idea what you've done to me do you?
If anything happened at all!
And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some...
I know you!
How do you know what I experience?
I was honest with you.
I told you who I was.
Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular?
I mean what would be the point.
Well why is that up to me?
Well what is this?
And if you think that's what this is -
women friends of yours...
all over the world.
Do you see some of them again?
Do you forget others?
Do you write them now and then?
Across the street.
Where was she?
You're right you know.
You're somewhere else where?
What were your parents like?
Why were you trouble?
I bet you could do a book.
On that one is beautiful.
I sat there once.
It was hot.
Near the church.
I sat outside and had coffee.
Nobody's asking you to.
I just feel like I'm getting a little...
out of control that's all.
Have you ever been to that station?
Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Take me somewhere.
You want to eat something?
want to move to the bedroom?
Yes that'd be nice.
How about if I set the table?
I've got everything under control.
Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Want to help?
They're all having a good time.
Oh how is he?
I want you to come.
even though we know it's just -- I mean it's nothing like that but if anybody saw us or...
I had lunch in town today.
Look I'm running a little late but I'll still...
I'll drive myself.
I'll pick you up.
Would you like to come with me?
If you're interested...
I would love to come for dinner.
Listen I'm sorry I --
I thought we were just having a conversation.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
What made you ask such a question?
Do you want to leave your husband?
No I'm just saying --
That's not what you're saying.
I know it's not the same.
What you're saying is it's not as good.
Or it's not as normal or proper.
But it's not the same.
But I love them just the same.
But no one in particular.
I told you I love other people.
But -- how can you just live for what you want?
What about other people?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No I think I need everyone!
I love people.
I want to meet them all!
I just think there are too many out there saying ""This is mine.
"" or ""She's mine.
Woman friends too?
I've got friends all over the world.
Good friends I can see when I want if I want.
I never got lost.
Well I thought it was a good idea at the time.
You can get lost moving around so much.
Do you mind if I...
We're not doing anything wrong do you.
I'll do them later.
I can look it up.
"" Who wrote that?
You've got it all right here you know.
It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen.
You want to go back in?
You get used to it.
How I'd love to see that.
I've never thought about it...
Why did you stop?
I'd like to think so.
I'm too normal.
"" I like that.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
From what I can tell I got here just in time.
You sure you're all right?
He's very...
And of course being with Richard.
I'd call that a change.
People are always so afraid of change.
Must be nice having kids.
No your kids.
As long as it takes I might stay a week.
Where's your family?
And how long are you here for?
I thought it was funny.
I'm so sorry about that.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Well thank you for all your help Mrs.
Looking for something in particular?
I've been in a very...
I've never done anything like that before.
I'm not that out of date am I?
This time of year.
So how long you've been living here?
I'm not from here.
When did you move back?
No that's not right.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Well you're pretty close.
It's only about two miles from here.
I'm also taking Mrs.
You're more than half her age.
Want anything special for dinner?
It's only four days.
I'm not sick Richard.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
It's after eleven.
Well you should all go to bed early.
Can we turn it off?
I found it the other day.
You should bring her home to meet us!
Well she's...
she's real pretty and...
Well what's nice about her?
She's real nice.
Think for a second.
I was paying the check.
I told her to wait for me right here!
Oh God where is she?
Oh my God...!
Maybe you can ask her.
Well she was very specific.
Apparently just before her death.
When did she decide this?
Well close the fucking door by all means.
Your father was his best friend.
So he must hate him the most of all now.
He'll take his time.
But even if it is too late.
If your father is dead.
It's not over.
It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Get the hell out of there.
He lived there.
And died there too.
Or let me.
Then what do you care?
He yours sir?
You think that's really him?
Take who where?
yeah I get it.
I can see it now.
This is the place for us.
So what the hell's the good news?
Is this Hell?
Yeah we can.
We'll deal with it then.
Where's the others?
Maybe just a little.
She's family.
You are the real shit.
And you know it.
You want us to move in here?
I think it's...
Yeah and it took some doing to get out of there.
Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
That's some terrible shit.
That's what?
And nobody gave it to me --
I said no thanks.
Just try it.
Here check it out.
So you never have to pay out.
But things change.
What it will be.
What it is?
Where we'll always be...
Where are we baby?
I want you to do something for me baby.
I've got what I want.
Turn around baby look at me.
Look at your man.
Second it's got to have just a little give here.
Come home with me now.
Must be my clothes line.
Left hand's the past.
Your right's the present.
And the future.
There's something here a new line right across your life line.
Let me see your hand.
What will it take?
I never done a man - any man.
You about to find out.
And the hell everybody else right?
You were my Man.
I always looked after you.
You had a piece of everything I had.
Time like this is that what you really want to know?
You always told me it's a dog eat dog world.
Sorry my brother.
One simple word three little letters.
Not just big.
Like big business big.
Big government big.
They get about twelve and a half minutes.
I can remember when we was his age...
We have to find it.
And shut the door.
Told you so.
Maybe I got nothing to lose.
And they're in the house with him.
I got a little power sure.
But no more than you do.
Maybe we all do.
And even when he's done who knows.
Who knows where it'll stop.
But how do you know?
Maybe he just wanted to see us?
And now he's gone again.
Sure if it was really him.
But if it's him.
You got his hands.
Life's like that.
He was your father.
It's alright baby.
Good things are happening here.
Maybe for the first time ever.
And maybe that's all it takes.
All the more reason I should be here.
They're just that.
That's what you always said.
I've seen things.
You did too.
Just a bad place.
Maybe once upon a time.
But that was long ago.
They seemed alright.
Bring a little life to that old building.
You stay away from those kids.
And away from that dog.
Just like I got.
I have to finish this for class.
Here find my hand.
Let's just walk up there.
I'll stay with the boys.
I mean I'm not ready.
If you want to go home...
I'm sure I can make your mother like me.
I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
In this house.
And you believe her?
The dead get out?
The city of the dead.
What else does she say?
It goes way back.
Be seeing you.
But they will be.
Are they on the radio?
no really let us help.
It's just round the corner.
Yeah but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.
Leave your car and walk over here.
You got the shit?
But please help me...
That's the past.
I saw your face.
You knew that place.
You knew those people.
I came from there too.
As you can see now.
Why did you give a shit about the building?
Why did you care that we were there of all places?
You could have had it done.
That's an order!
You'll take care of it?
And we open tonight.
No one'll ever come here.
Shut it down.
Just trying to do what you did.
Take nothing and make something out of it.
Listen to me boy.
What are we doing down here?
A little business move I made.
On my own.
That place already died and gone to hell.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.
Making it better.
Make your choice.
No way man...
How old is --
You better hope not.
Look even if anyone found anything there it's twenty years ago.
Well somebody bought it.
You were supposed to sit on it.
Not sell it --
You sold the building.
I been watching you.
You done good.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
You was just doing your job.
Fair enough for the shit.
He's got something for us.
I knew he would once he thought about it.
We just thought...
How many times I told you --
It was just like in my head.
Get that car the hell away from here now!
I am the future.
I'm not sure what the hell you are.
But I think we can do better.
I was born near here.
My dad's from here.
He never mentioned it.
Not that I remember.
Yeah you heard of him?
Can you picture it?
Heard of them?
Not really to live just to play.
The fire started down there.
But after my mother died my dad moved.
You sure you're not from around here?
What we have to do is call the police.
Evidence of what?
Boy put that thing down.
Might be evidence.
Who's club is that?
How could that be?
You're a dead man!
A fucking dead man!
Where's what?
The same way you did before.
Open the case!
That's right I know.
I fucking know.
That you lost it.
Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.
Two point one seventy-six.
You want to get into this now?
Do you know who I am?!
We know how this was done eh?
You know he would have done you too.
I want what's mine half the money.
Say yes I understand.
They're all fine.
But everybody is all right.
You made me.
All part of the business.
What did she do to you?
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
You need the money just like we do.
Not until he has the money!
Where is the money?
it could be anywhere.
Once we have the money then none of this ever happened.
We have to find the money.
maybe three hours.
I've seen the way he looks at you.
He's always wanted you.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
You've never needed me!
I need you...
Not like this!
I bet you he's got it with him.
I bet it's in the car.
But it could be anywhere.
All I got to do is get it back.
The money's gone.
I know what I got to do!
I got to get the money.
Got to think this through...
So fucking what?
The money is gone.
I think I'm a dead man.
That's what I think!
But you know he did it.
I hate him!
I should've done him!
Open your fucking eyes!
They're still on their way.
They were early.
There's no time.
How did you...
I have to get out of here.
Did you know he did time himself?
So you just got out?
You know he's a good friend of mine.
I'm sorry Christ I thought...
It's all right sir.
Born with it.
Pretty good sir.
I hate to worry.
How many'd you do?
Where's the fucking money?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Where in the hell is he?
Is that the money?
Oh Christ the phone...
There was no answer.
I've got the money.
Let me call around.
This is a beautiful place.
We're for real.
Please open the door.
I was so afraid you...
just hang on.
okay all right.
You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Oh Christ I got to get out of here!
All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
I've never seen him like this.
He's out of his fucking mind.
Jesus that's beautiful.
He'll have to run.
Shit I'm sorry!
You have to make it as real as you can.
Everyone will think I did it.
If he does...
I'm just asking what if?
Poor boy has to work so hard.
What time did you say they would be there?
He gets right to the point.
Both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left.
It's getting better and better.
He does it right in front of him.
Not much really.
That's his brother.
It started way before I was around.
Like each other?
They hate each other.
In his office.
I saw it this morning.
And where is it now?
Do you think you know me like that?
I'm just making a point.
You have no idea what you're asking.
All right let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
I am but...
That's why I need your help.
You said you were good.
Do you have any idea what you are saying?
You made a choice once.
Do you think you would make that same choice again?
I want a new life.
I suppose that's why he's good at it.
They're all like that.
Not like I do.
That's what he told himself.
That's how they are.
I understand them.
He was in love with you right?
Even though he knew about you?
He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
He saw me in a bar with another woman.
What about that guy this morning?
But they're wrong.
I heard you!
I know what I am.
Oh no she's nothing like you.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Shit here we go.
I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
She was always more honest than me.
I'm already in your bed.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
What I did time for?
Five years is a long time.
Almost five years.
How long have you been with him?
They took over a club I was working at.
How did you meet him?
You have to ask?
I needed that.
If I say yes will you take your hand away?
Okay one drink.
You have to let me pay you something --
I'm sorry look forget it.
Yeah come on in.
He said you lost something.
My dad was like that.
We never had anything new.
You're doing everything yourself?
No no trouble.
There's other work to do.
Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.
But if it's too much trouble I understand...
Are they really?
Oh I'm sorry --
thanks I needed this.
One day at a time.
if he would just answer the question that's the end of it.
We go now.
We talk now.
You take care of this girl or I find out!
Get away from all of this.
We want to take care of it ourselves and we will.
I'll find him.
I think everything is okay.
You just get out of here okay?
Go for a walk.
Get out of my way.
Call it off.
You're not doing shit.
Maybe he's in there to finish the job.
You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Where does he turn?
He's got nothing.
What if he turned?
He's out of control.
It's very clear what needs to happen.
I'm not asking.
How much more do you want me to tell you?
If it's a cover it's a great one.
And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.
You'd want to make that go away.
What do they want me to do?
what did you do?...
or in a car...
it's a problem...
you have that...
which one are you?...
both of us...
We can give it back to you...
We'll make you better.
We can put the pieces back.
That's all I get?
So it's time to go home.
So now you know.
We had to try.
What the hell're you talking about?
Get the kids out!
I know who sent you.
Who do you think sent me?
How does it feel to be dead?
Look maybe I should just...
I mean I think so.
One moment sir.
Do you have Mr.
One moment please...
Yes I'm...
I'm looking for Mr.
I think not...
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's very bad this.
Such a young man.
You know his brother?
When they came for his things it was made known for us you see?
Really I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
I have some very bad news for you sir.
You are a friend of his?
Yes I'm here...
Was it the break-in?
We thought you were gone for good.
Come right in...
What was I thinking right?
There's enough in there to make a life.
Just get out now.
We have to keep moving.
Stop where you are.
That's who I want to be.
You could do that?
It's who you want to be.
We have this money.
We have what we have.
I say we leave here.
We leave this place.
who is he?
It's a name.
-- what just happened in there?
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
I found the body.
It's a company...
Who paid the bill?
-- we'll tell them what happened --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's no time --
But the police --
And where is he now?
He had my picture!
He knew I was here!
You knew he was coming.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
He went out the window -- why?
-- why would someone do that?
-- what are you doing?
-- let me do this okay?
-- he's got my picture!
-- this is yesterday!
-- this is me!
--  -- where did you get my picture?
-- where does this come from?
--  How do you have my picture?
this is my picture...
this is yesterday --
--  -- what is it?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- what're you doing?
-- it's not like that --
It's starting to come back yeah?
This is your office?
This is really yours?
How could I forget about you?
You're the only person I know.
With you I mean you'd probably just forget about me right?
Look you could come up.
Or you could wait if you want.
I could go check it out.
You could wait.
So this is it right?
Pull in here.
I thought about it.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
We're about an hour away.
I needed a break.
Why do I?
I knew how to do it.
-- which was okay for a while I was okay with it...
But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...
I think something bad happened.
-- you could put it together --
I kept trying things I thought if I could find all the things I could do I could --
Well this is great.
I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
It's just not there.
put the radio on...
Listen to what you want.
What kind of music do you like?
I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.
It's not my car.
Like we're a couple.
That's all we're doing.
You could buy this car.
All I want to do is go home.
I feel so much better now.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
No that was too easy --
I said ten thousand.
I've got a situation here and --
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- what do I?
-- I put the name of the person I came to see?
Is this it?
--  -- this is it right?
Where's the book?
So get the hell out of here.
Where did this body go?
I have no time to explain.
It's always something right?
He run away often?
My husband's out looking for him.
-- I told this to the case officer last week...
I told Mr.
-- I'm on it --
They must have something.
He's coming down for a show and tell.
We've just got to be the first ones there.
Get everybody up.
Maybe it's a game.
-- and they're sure it's him?
Tell him we're busy.
-- I want everyone out!
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting!
-- what're you talking about?
Look I'm just on this boat okay?
Whatever this is it's not for me to be involved okay?
You need to rest.
How did I get here?
You're on a boat.
You were in the water.
It's okay now.
get to it.
have a look.
I think we'd better have a look.
You telephone sir.
You must save the day.
What do I have to do.
But if you help us we'll help you.
but tomorrow is another one
You mean you've got...
We've got everything here.
We know that too.
You've come to the right place.
Then perhaps you can help me.
I've lost someone who...
We know everything here.
Yes it was...
Was it all right otherwise?
- the party started half an hour ago.
Thank you very much mother but actually -
He will be pleased when he comes home.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
You're a very good little girl.
Thank you David...
I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
in a free society information is the name of the game.
I did that...
You must know that!
Get me out of here!
Yes you've got to get me out of here.
I've got to find her.
That's for me to say.
I know he would have wanted me to help you...
Your father and I were very close.
If I can help you...
How do you think I feel?
How could you do this to me?
Do you know what you're doing.
Take her off the list.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
And you're mine.
Let me try to get to her.
Hell not for any reason...
but I would've found out anyway.
What's she done?
I'm sure you have
I did not get the wrong man.
I got the right man.
Was I wrong?
You got the wrong man.
Well your A.
Sorry carry on.
You do know it all!
This is the situation.
Enough though eh?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Sorry about that...
I used to wonder if they were real.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Er I knew you looked different.
Long time no see!
They sent me here.
They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
is it me?
It's our only hope.
What happened to you after...
What are you do...
how did you...
Maybe I was wrong.
Who are your friends?
It must he something very special.
It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Come out I know you're in there
""And your children all gone.
The house is on fire!
What have we done?
Come on let's go!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
I was right!
Will you please turn back.
but this is real.
They'll be there waiting.
I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Look at that - right on time.
it's only my first day.
Well no system is.
We've got both.
Looking for you.
A heavy Christmas present.
It's heavy.
What does it look like...
It looks as if you're taking me.
Why did you run away?
It's my fucking life.
Hey that's not a very nice thing to say.
being here with you.
Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them!
Do as I say!
It's you...
it's you...
You've only just turned it down!
They never tell you anything.
But come the time they want something from us...
Can I forget it?
Leave it to me.
What do I do next?
You'd never get away with it.
Well that's it!
I may as well go and hang myself!
Perhaps we can lose it...
He is dead.
I've tried that!
Send it to somebody else.
We've got to get rid of it!
I've told you before.
I'd turn it down.
It's not the machine.
Ah there we go!
You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself.
That's what I wanted to know.
Look you're putting me off standing there!
A woman eh?
There's someone I want to check out.
I'll tell you what....
You tell me what and I'll do it for.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Ah yes you're the new boy from next door ha ha!
There's only one left in here now and I need that to sit on!
How long will she he away?
Well she's my mother not yours.
My mother said it would be all right.
you've got to help me...
Actually I've decided...
He thinks you should see a doctor.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Everybody's here.
Of course you want something.
What were we saying?
You're not listening mother.
He was very close to me.
You'll like it when you get there.
I'm happy where I am.
He was good...
What have you done with his body?
Not my department...
Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
I think that'll hold it.
Here we are!
I know I know...!
Actually there's someone I want to meet...
Nothing to worry about.
Whatever happened to you?
It's my lunch hour.
Put the phone down and your hands up.
But I could be anybody.
No need sir
Mother I need to...
Ah yes the lady is waiting.
But we can get one.
Now look what you've done to him.
I mean it's all right.
On the house.
How much will it...?
What do they want you or?
There's your problem.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Hold it there.
as long as I'm careful.
well that's a different matter...
Could you hold these.
I called Central Services.
Are you from Central Services?
Nice and easy now.
I love this guy.
What if there is no tomorrow?
I'll fire you tomorrow.
The City needs you.
Hell better than that I'll forward you some sick time.
A week two weeks off-- how about that?
Everyone's called in sick.
I said you want to fire him come over and do it yourself.
That's what I've been telling you.
She's having a baby.
You know each other a long time?
It can happen.
I'm trying to watch my weight and look what happens.
I needed a coffee.
I've been thinking about things.
There's plenty of food in my place.
Just take it easy.
That's the stuff.
What you need is one of these.
What's it like?
I better just go in and see her.
She asked me to pick her up.
Let's do it!
She said to me I love the way you talk on the radio.
Twelve Young answer the radio.
I have a call for you.
I'm not your baby Young I'm not your mother either.
It's a club.
But I think it might do you some good.
Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
He's dead and there's nothing we can do.
No way man.
Okay what happened?
Sure sure give go.
No I'd better not.
Here you try.
Oh man do you mean that?
Thank you man thank you.
You came out of the hospital.
You are a very kind man.
Come on up.
This is not a good time.
It gets everybody.
I wish these people would leave already.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
He called me up today can you believe that?
I told him I hope he's right.
That's what I told him.
He looked pretty bad.
I need to sit down a minute.
You want to help me you feel sorry for me?
We can still go back.
I'll walk you home.
You asked me not to come.
No I'll be fine.
That way she'll let me go.
Maybe I should come up with you.
This woman I'm seeing she'll want to talk to me all day but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting I can be out quick.
They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in.
I need you to wait for me outside this building okay?
You seemed like you were in trouble.
I better go check on my father.
Maybe when he gets better you know when we're done with all this.
It must be my face.
I was a different person then.
I think I'd remember that.
I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
How long you been doing this?
We moved out after that.
It's best not to...
My father was a great man you know.
He lived in our house for almost a year.
Look I'm sorry but it's important to me.
He's better.
He's better though right?
That's how it's done.
Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Maybe we could.
I think it looks good.
You look so different.
It's still early it might mean nothing but I thought you'd want to know.
I'd take her but then who would stay here?
She should go home.
What's wrong with that doctor?
Did you see my father?
That's my brother's problem.
If she could just see him a second then I could take her home.
Take her home.
Even when you say the things there's always more things.
It's really hard on my mother.
The first is always the best.
Is there any chance?
We'd better go outside.
He's very very sick.
Do you have any music?
That's three jobs for the night.
Three jobs and time for a drink.
Think of it that way.
It's all over your face.
That's too many.
Hold her down.
That's a first.
I need a drink that's all.
You know what I'm talking about the way she looked at me.
I call you if anything comes up.
Make a left here.
I want to stop.
No you never told me that story.
He's not dead.
She only works when I'm on.
It can always get worse.
You got to let the Lord take over in here.
I'm on my way out.
My Lord mother man you look like hell.
Last show of the night.
Should be up there in a couple of hours.
The other one seems okay though.
How many months?
The family know?
He one of them?
He got better.
You did all you could.
He was getting better.
Believe me it always works.
He knows exactly what he's doing.
This is the guy.
I've been after him for weeks.
I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
What's the reason?
I feel the need.
What do you want to break?
We'll wait for a real call.
As long as we keep moving.
No standing still.
Better bring it all.
That's all right we're not meant to do Oh tonight.
It's early for him.
I never felt better in my life.
Put your head out the window get some of that summer air.
Listen to the music.
Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
One more time!
It's just a matter of time and who you know.
Tell me you ever think of doing anything else?
We've got a good job here.
No time of any kind.
I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
It's Mr.
That's what we're here for.
You wanted it turned off.
There's no such thing as a good fire.
Wait I've got it.
What you getting?
You missed it.
Four times this week I've had him.
They'll give it to someone else.
You know it's that time.
That can only mean one thing.
You see he's giving it to us anyway.
I thought she'd be here.
You know what I...
Hold it down okay?
What did they do with you?
I'll put her on.
Everybody has one like that.
And the left side of your face is the good one.
Oh God no!
Sit on it!
We sure do.
I'm starting to...
There are only ten.
Just tell me if you know.
Shut up a second...
You have the job you have...
I'm not buying into any of that.
What did I do to you?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
What's doing?
You write this?
You're almost there you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Shit shit shit...
Stop the tape okay.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.
That's your full name?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
I like it!
Well we met about three months ago.
So who's the guy?
I hope so...
I'll miss you we'll talk we'll always be friends...
we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it okay?
Okay that's very easy.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I just found out.
Will you meet me now?
Sit down stop.
And I'm in love with you.
You know that I'm not.
And he'll get all the great women.
I know you care about him.
Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.
Let me think a second.
I think it is important for you too.
This is important to me.
I may be in love with him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait right?
I have to be somewhere.
-- you're making too much out of it...
I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
I lost six pounds...
Then what was good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Do you feel good about it?
Did it really go well?
Then it went well.
Have a good time tonight.
if not I'll have the tape...
I'm not sure I'll be able to...
just very nice...
I wish I could be there.
I'd really like to look...
what's the word I'm looking for?...
It's not a date.
I was thinking that way too...
I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...
See you there...
You sure they said the management meeting?
They want me to be at the management meeting.
You go have a good time...
You have some place to go?
Anyway well why not  tell you?
-- it's a happy thing.
And I'll stop here but Jane I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...
Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Well whatever you think.
We're very busy here.
I'll come by your place right after...
I write for you sometimes.
We can cut back at the end.
Great line at the end.
They're giving me less and less air time.
Eleven and a half.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Let's do me.
He must have been great-looking right?
Let's do this.
Oh you mean use him...
Your hair's a little funny.
It's what he did.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.
Do one thing to me?
I think it could turn them around.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people...
They want to fire me.
I want you to think of this as...
I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
What do you say we take a walk?
-- Thirty-six years...
It depends on how big a news day it is.
You want to use that?
How long has it been since you've been home.
Move away from me.
Just a few questions?
Take care Paul.
Oh come on -- tell us another.
We have a minute and a half.
Oh that's nice...
We'll need some new lines.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Just when do you start telling people?
I'll speak to you soon
He's right here.
It's started.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?
I'll never tell.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Let me hear it!
He said something about...
Play back the last line...
Well who knows.
I'll speak to you.
good-bye then.
I'm doing fine...
Look I can start up with him again if you really...
You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
And look in the future I can call you when I have news for you.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Nobody else had it.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
I always hear things before they happen.
Hey and from now on so do you.
Yes it's true.
I really have to go.
One's enough.
You talked me into it.
How do I get out of here?
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.
Some will want to talk.
It could help.
It's Paul.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
That would be great.
It better help.
What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
What do you think the problem is?
I got my report card.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Maybe you should feel that way.
What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?
Not even you.
Fill for a second.
I had no idea she was this good.
No it's awful.
Oh my it's awful.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Not near ready.
It's so good to see you.
Well we should talk.
Look what I got for you.
Why did I have to do this to myself?
Watch you take off.
Call me if you need anything.
It's better when you let me say it.
Then you should stay here.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Never mind what you think.
I knew what you meant.
Well let's do a special report on that...
I mean that's news.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.
You mean something to me.
Try and get this.
This is a one-way argument.
Well that's a much bigger deal.
I go to London right after that.
So it'd be very big deal if you stay here.
Jane Jane Jane Jane Jane...
I was up all night and...
Of course it's the reason.
It's terrible what you did.
I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.
That's not the reason you're not coming?
Then give me a minute...
That's yes?
This has happened at every station I ever worked for.
I have a week to get to my job.
How can you say that to me?
He gets like that sometimes.
Did he really?
I feel terrible about what happened.
I'll see you at the office.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.
That sounds more important.
Let's forget about tonight.
You want me to talk to him?
It's not that it's hard.
I'd like to know.
I'll go along.
I just thought of a third...
Oh let's see -- wait a minute well I can think of two reasons.
It moved me.
but it's real and it got me...
So what did you think?
We can go together.
Maybe I'll get off work.
I'd like to go.
Why you need me for the story?
Is it your story?
Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
Hey you called me.
I have an idea for something.
Does it have to be right now?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
I'll get you through.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Come on I'll buy you a drink.
Well I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.
I'll wait for you till seven.
How long do you think you'll be there?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
right of course.
I've got another story.
I know how much I have to learn.
If you're through work now --
How does it feel being here?
I'm sorry if I was in the way.
We're working here!!
They said it would be okay if...
So I'll probably see you at work.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Just what do you want from me anyway?
almost one year.
Well come on -- it is your life.
Did you go to college?
So great -- right?
Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Do you want to keep talking?
That actually goes on...
Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.
If we could just eat first.
I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.
I have about two thousand questions for you.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.
More than a great break maybe just what I needed...
just when I needed it...
I was a lot earlier.
And you did that.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.
Right back to you.
You're saying stay away from him.
Do I mind?
Why do I mind?
So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Okay I'll go first.
This is my first time at the White House.
Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Boy that's nice...
I wish we could all deal with each other like this.
The way you were looking at me I just went.
What are you sorry about?
A girl with a body like mine?
I already told you I'm not.
Oh it's enough...
I'm almost ready -
What right now?
I just might.
Would you like to do me?
See you later -
He made a cat.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Alright I got you man.
That's about it for tonight.
Alright we're clear.
stay away from me!
Would you really like to?
That would make me very happy.
Would you let me make...
I've been thinking...
I'm sorry about what I said before.
We're just friends.
I see the whole thing now.
I want to talk about it now!
Now let's go in there and when the show's over maybe we can talk about it.
Ever since you first came to the club.
That means you like me!
what did you want to talk to me about?
Nice night out...
But I wanted to talk to you.
We've got plenty of time.
I mean you look so pretty.
All about me...
Did you hear what he said?
They're both great.
I came over to see you.
I brought something...
I wanted to show you.
I've never seen anything like it before...
and I hope I never see anything like it again.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Look at the size of it!
It's a...
it's wonderful.
You really like it?
A thing I made.
what have you got?
Put it in the middle of the room!
Here you go enjoy.
That's word for word.
Well I've been thinking...
It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.
Even you can see its value.
I've never seen anyone so...
Do you want to come along?
When do we get to see it?
Are you trying to be funny?
What are you doing here so early?
very very nice...
Do you really like them?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I like it very much...
Yeah right outside the door!
Maybe he started taking it.
Man this is heavy!
Man look at that get up!
It was out there...
I think he's looking for you man...
I wonder what his deal is.
Look at that man.
I do the research.
we'll tell them...
Listen you've got to stop right away!
Well Why not?
Just wait till you see this!
What do you have in the box?
Yeah and what would I say?
You might talk too much.
but for now you've got to break out of this one...
how soon can we go?
Not exactly I mean you take years and years...
Like this Sunday?
You want me to open a window or something?
It's hot in here...
Well I mean it could have been something else but it just worked out that way.
I-I already got a new one!
What am I doing?
Things are different now...
good night Mr.
I'm sure you'll think of something.
Look go home and...
work on something.
Make another cat.
you came in early.
Did you hear that Mr.
Enough already about it - get to work!
People seem to like my cat.
Alright I'll tell you what.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?
You want to buy it put it in the club?
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Where'd ya buy that?
Well I brought something I wanted to show you.
Well do some looking around the room.
Well that's not what I pay you for now is it?
Listen to me listen to me...
look I'm busy...
What do you want for it?
I want that cat.
You're coming with me!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!
Make it easy for yourself use your head.
It can get real expensive.
Is that what that is?
I never seen any before.
I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Telling you what?
I also saw the girl give you this.
Did you see my cat?
Yes you have.
Have you heard some of the things they've been saying?
After that we go no more!
Sounds good though.
I saw your...
Yes get rid of them...
Are you done with these?
I worked in one of them.
I know that - I know that!
Maybe it will let you think of me.
There's a little something for you in here...
Then let me give you something then...
Well I'll go home with you.
you've turned on.
With Dead Cat.
With Dead Cat?
I will - good night Mrs.
just as long as she takes good care of you...
If you see him.
What's got into that cat?
If you were my son...
What did you have to eat today?
Oh hello Mrs.
Not a boy...
Find out if they're dead.
The other two -- the new ones.
I look horrible.
This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself...
twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
You let him have it!
What's wrong with you!?!
Nice to feel needed.
Can I be your friend?
He's got a...
What do you call it?
Get away from here.
What's wrong with you man?
It's getting...
Oh yeah and then you'll never call me.
They're all the same!
It's coffee.
We're looking at a dog possible coffee...
That's it man.
That's the whole story.
But I still want to know what happens.
Which way did she go?
Yeah I saw her.
Did you see a girl come by here?
You know and a picture of the earth.
You're so lucky.
What's playing there?
Do you know what time it is?
It's not working out at all.
I've got to move on.
I mean I've got needs too.
I told you about all this.
I thought we were meeting here.
You know -- training and all.
I called your house like four times.
Hey baby how ya doing?
Come on what was it?
Who's in it?
What show is this?
Hey it works for me.
yeah I'm okay.
I am so sure.
I am a God!
A thousand years and more.
I just thought maybe we should wait.
We've come all this way.
We just have to check it out.
Who's afraid?
We could maybe wait till later.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Some of them might not come after me.
There's a hundred of them out there.
He did what he was supposed to.
And it's important.
I been working on some stuff for you.
I think it's him.
I think I could help.
I kind of thought I ought to be here.
Why'd you come back?
And I just wanted to say...
Oh I'll be fine.
Got my chair got my window I'm great.
I think I'll just hang out here.
Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Everything just looked so small.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was...
I'll back that up.
You need a hand?
Tomorrow morning I'm on a bus.
Well stay here tonight.
I have a friend and he's really...
You had a car full of stuff.
Do you do this kind of thing a lot?
You want some water or something?
Oh I'm good.
I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Is that your car?
What language are you speaking?
The earth is our home.
I need to tell you.
a while ago I met this guy --
You were supposed to be here at three.
it's not a big deal.
Let's meet tonight okay?
) What do you think?
He knows who I am!
And where are they now?
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Football is my life.
Oh I'll be there all right.
Not till you're ready.
It's not right.
Make time okay?
You're the one who told me to act normal.
But it's in the back.
As for example what?
I wish you would.
That's where I was born.
I'm not supposed to...
How can you keep doing this?
Not if you're careful.
Do you want to live?
It's so down.
The one and only?
I think I did.
Never corner yourself like that.
Two days ago would you have even hit me?
Put your head back.
It was necessary.
And then you come along...
I had to test you.
Oh what the hell is wrong with you?
I do it.
It would be interesting.
Well everybody says...
It's not a look.
But you stopped.
I tell you the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.
What's your best subject?
For your parents.
We'll cover it later.
Why do you keep saying that?
There's a great deal I have to show you I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Go to school tomorrow.
Try to act normal.
Where's the other one?
I just need you to watch.
I have to show you.
And there's a guy...
He's not always there but he's horrible all white and he's always...
I never told anybody about this.
In the past.
Just stay away from me okay?
Tell you to do things?
Time to do what?
You must come with me while there's still time.
You must come with me.
It's much too late already.
To bring you...
I was sent to find you some time ago.
Am I in trouble or something?
I'm looking for you actually.
God where the hell did you come from?
Later for it.
Yeah just make sure you do first.
She's okay though.
I mean you kind of have to.
I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
He's always giving me a hard time.
'  I have no sense of history?
Or mean or whatever.
I can learn.
I'm useful.
Yes I'm sure they do.
My parents have money...
So very much.
You are much more.
I'm just a girl.
She has died.
You are the next to be called.
Why do you think you were sent to me?
You know you must.
There is only one.
Now you are that one.
It is time.
I heard she got straight A's.
Well I'm done.
Make me a woman!
Okay what else?
Throw it out.
What should I do with it?
What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Well I hope so.
What is she...
Well that's the thing.
Hey wait a minute...
It's a fish.
You kind of wish they would though.
As long as there's room for three in it.
So we're stupid now?
You're so out of it.
I saw you last night after the game.
I really was way way too too.
What were you thinking about?
Well look who's here.
Ah you'll be coming back.
Sell this place...
I think I'm ready for the Show.
How can I possibly thank you?
--but you're father's in there!
I mean I'm getting it--
I'd like you to meet my father.
it's okay..
I'll be back when we lose.
You got things all wrong!
I'm trying to play with your body!
You're playing with my mind!
He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
No no it was great.
Just till I lose.
I'm yours.
It's just another way of living.
It's all the same thing.
How ya like that?
A little better.
How was that?
Okay fire a couple in there.
What is this ""I I I"" stuff?
You only talk about yourself?
These'll help move things to the right side.
God I never thought of that.
You can learn to like it.
Yeah maybe you're right.
Would you rather me be making love to him using your name or making love to you using his name?
We both just know.
No no--I'm fine.
You should be at the game.
It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I can do that too.
You'd be great just great...
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
It takes years of practice...
I heard already.
It's true It's true!
And I saw him.
Is there no man who'll have me?
Do you have a job?
And he's right!
You know how hard this game is?
I think of you and the ""boy"" all the time.
I want to be had.
From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.
I had to have you!
I'm a woman.
Or do you want a guy?
Your place or mine?
Oh no I think it'd be great!
The record's
That's my job too.
You had your chance the other night.
I'm not interested yet.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
What do you believe in?
I thought we should get to know each other.
I'll learn.
He'll learn.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
He looks great just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour.
She will Mr.
Oh let's not...
Good--then listen.

It's cold in here.
I love this part.
Oh both of you of course...
Which one of us?
Shall we go to my place?
That's what I been telling everybody!
Will that work for me?

You missed him!
Yeah thanks for everything.
Maybe you do.
I just like to see you get all worked up.
Sorry about last night.

The moment's over.
I was great eh?
We're almost home.
Party without me.
What do I got?
He did know.
I thought I was--
And where can I go?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.
He can go all the way.
Why the hell am I back in ""A"" ball?
She's playing with my mind.
You can do anything you want.
I'm getting too old for this game.
I understand this party-- but...
Eight and twenty-four!
Eight and twenty-four.
Eight and sixteen?!
How'd we ever win eight?
We're eight and sixteen.
He walked eighteen?!
Jim looking for somebody.
Well I'd rather not say.
Where does he go?
He never gets back till four or five--
It's like everything else in this place.
I have nothing.
Look at yours.
This is his state.
I mean the guy is history as far as I'm concerned.
he did what he was told.
Yes you were.
Did you not?!
I was in the building!
Was I at that dinner?
Just tell me -
I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Hey I need a room.
Need a room.
I would just get out.
It's all that I'm saying.
Maybe he should...
get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?
Know what my problem is?
I mean what do you do about that?
How can I walk away?
They want you to walk away from -
You you know if I did it I'd have to run it my way.
Why would they want to find out?
But what happens when they do find out?
I mean look what the hell she's doing.
Wait hold on a second.
All right take care.
How's your family?
No it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes.
We got other things to do too you know.

I just bought us a few minutes.
I know she's there.
Put her on the phone.
Well if you ever come back again...
to take her money...
That way you got a chance.
You knew that she's my wife?
Hey look at me.
Yeah sure I do.
What time did your mother do this?
When did she leave?
Oh no please please.
Who did this to you?
Have a good day at school.
I want to just talk.
Yeah she's here.
She's there with you?
No I'm not okay.
Well once you get her here you think about it you know?
She wants to come back.
She was afraid to call you.
And what'd she want?
I just told you.
Just give me the money.
That's the only reason!
I asked you?!
Get this through your head you -
Do you remember what I told you?
Do you remember what I told...
I mean every time I meet somebody here the big question is do I know you.
I'm known.
People see me.
What are you -
Just be there.
Meet me at three.
And at the...
You better check yourself...
A week ago it was my business now it's none of my business.
That's right yeah.
It's none of my business?
It's none of your business okay?
And I - what was I supposed to do throw her out?
She came to talk to me...
Hey she came to talk...
Listen I would -
What good would that do?
Well she comes to see me.
Now what does she have to do with all this?
Even your own wife.
I'm - I lost control?!
Yes you lost your control.
I lost control?
You lost your control.
Will you tell me?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned.
That looks bad.
I have no control over that.
They'll tell you exactly what happened.
All right fine.
I'll be honest with you.
Just say so.
You should say so.
Where's my head?
Where's your head?
And what is it with you?
You think he got the point?
Well it's okay.
I'll see you at nine.
very difficult to get in.
No no it's okay.
Here let's put a little of this on for you.
I know you like this.
And over the years he always made money with them.
That's how serious it is.
Let's say...
Is there any way around this?
Yeah I believe it.
'  Do you believe this shit?
They want to put you in the Black Book.
You better watch yourself.
You're still eight pounds over.
What's the reason for this?
I'm sorry about this.
If he does it again he's out for good.
So what do you think I do?
But you know what he did?
You been lucky all week.
So I'm lucky.
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Yeah right I'm sure.
But I saw it another.
So I started getting everybody in line.
I want to get away from back home for a while.
Look at this place.
It's made of money.
You know what the best part is?
There's nobody here to see us!
Everybody's back home.
It's not like back home.
he hit me with it.
I mean he took care of himself only too well.
Told you it was eight.
It was eight.
Yeah we made a great pair.
They all made money with us.
That's the way you do it.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
Matter of fact...
Your people never will understand the way it works out here.
But you act like you're at home.
you know that's it.
Well could there be any position...
You have got me there.
There's not much more I can do for him.
He's got lots of friends here.
Now his family and their money go back many many years.
That's important to me...
And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...
No that's quite all right.
Yeah I heard a lot about you.
I'll come by.
You come by the house?
Well it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.
I'll know by then.
Well that's why they paid so well.
How the hell'd you do it?
Let's go to lunch.
They're dear friends of mine.
All right we're clear.
And they were usually right.
You go and put your things away.
Half of everything is mine.
She's out of her fucking mind.
You've got to stop her.
Just stop everything.
It's always been our policy -
Just - just give me the right answer.
Why is she eight pounds over?
Well sir I was just...
I-I'll do it.
Yeah Bill listen I'll explain to you later.
Bring it over here right away.
No just - just give him give him ten.
The little guy.
Why not make them happy?
We need this guy.
They had all the pieces they needed.
But it was just mine.
Should I let her in like -?
Let me in the house!
Oh you are...
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
I'm in the same clothes for two days!
I want to get a few of my things!

Will you stop it?
Just wait there for me!

Get in the car and go to the house...
I want you to let me go.
Let you go?
Listen to me listen to me listen to me.
I should have -
you out of your mind?
That's our child.
I can back him off.
she did what she did and I did what I had to do.
I know you were with somebody.
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.
I just hope it's not them.
I was with somebody.
Who were you with?
You know why I want to do it.
Why do you want to do that?
She had the same.
I had a...
What'd you have?
And where'd you go?
So who'd you go to lunch with?
I put her to bed.
Look I tried to do this thing.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Is this enough money?!
And I still get my money.
I'll go but I want my money right now!
I want you out of here!
Come with me now!
Come with me now.
Get off of me!
I want you to come with me now.
I'm home...
Around ten thousand?
I bought him a watch too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
He wanted a watch too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He needed some clothes.
So what'd ya do with it?
Okay no big deal.
He got his twenty-five.
That I'll live with.
Yeah yeah I got the rest.
the rest of the two million is still there?
twenty-five thousand?
It's under...
What's it...
I under-understand that.
Just who you wanted to talk to right?
Well that's why I'm here.
Look in my eyes.
We had a deal.
It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon.
Where would you be then?
How could you say that?
You're a beautiful woman.
I know you better than you know yourself.
And when you set your mind on doing something you do it better than anybody.
Yes I - yes I do.
That's all you care about.
They got plenty of good ones.
people look up to you in this town.
Yeah how do I know?
What'd you do with 'em?
Take him for everything he's got.
You remember when you called him that night?
Good so then you could tell me what the money is for.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
Why do want to make me feel so bad?
I never had to ask anybody for anything.
It's not the money it's just why do you want it?
Now I want you to tell me.
I mean I'm you know tell me what it's for.
I'm aware of that.
It was important to me.
But forget it.
Just something I wanted to do for myself.
That's a lot of money.
Well what's the difference?
I just need it.
Why do you need that much?
Twenty-five thousand?
well I need more than that.
I need twenty-five thousand.
There's a lot there.
You get her?
Well I need a lot.
Hey do you want to see this one?
Can I keep this one in the house?
The only thing is...
You're so wonderful.
You do whatever you want.
So do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Let's go back in.
You're with me now.
That part of your life is over with.
I just -  You just have to understand.
I - I just...
I think I have a right to do that.
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.
Want to take a chance?
And if there are kids especially you know I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
No I - I...
I can accept that.
But you know what is...
What is love anyway?
I feel that eventually you would care enough about me...
that I could live with that.
I - I - I...
Yeah I know all that.
I'm forty-three years old.
I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.
What you've known me two three months.
I know I'd be a good father.
I know you'd be a good mother.
I want a family.
Within no time everything was set in place.
The per was way up.
I hit a few...
Okay thank you for asking.
We all have a past.
You have a past I have a past.
And my past is no worse than yours.
What are you running for?
You son-of- a
There was nothing to it.
No no no no please please please please no please.
How many kids do you have?
Well I've got a large family.
If you did know you were in on it.
Either way you're out!
I really think you're -
Well it happened so quick.
I do understand that.
There are three ways of doing things around here.
The right way the wrong way and the way I do it.
All right I will I will.
The action is in the front not in the back.
Bring 'em up front.
They bring all the action.
Okay I'll -
Ah yes here we are.
You've been very open with us.
Look what they did to my hand man!
I never tried.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Can you do that with both hands?
I thought it was yours.
Is this yours?
You call yourself a man?
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.
So that's what I did.
I gave 'em the money.
When I left here with the money...
No you - You want me to come over there?
You know where she gets this from!
you got a minute?
He's got two million in the box am I right?
We go to Europe.
I mean after all you're the one having a good time not me.
Come on go back there?
This is personal.
I'll be there in the morning.
That's my business.
I think I want my money back.
we talked about this...
Well I've been busy.
You need to understand and I - I'm sure you do...
Yeah that works out.
You just - Just stop him.
No you can you can.
You've been so nice to me.
Go get a bag man.
If you could just ask the guy for a big bag okay?
Can I go in?
I'm just trying to get in my house!
This is none of your business!
She's on the account.
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
That way she'll get out of here.
This is half her house anyway.
Here we go!
Now move along.
You put your feet on the table...
Is that what you did?
I mean it was all about the kids you know.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Do you see that?
Is that the last one?
He's not here?
He's gone?
He was here before.
Yeah I'm over here with him.
I'm over here now.
Stay out of the way!
He's my husband!
But I'm just trying to leave.
I want to know...
If he's okay.
It's bad for business.
it's a problem.
It's private...
to take care of things a little better.
And I mean...
that's no good.
Yeah I heard yeah.
Do you know about that?
I want all the names of all the other people he had with him.
Want me to take this for you?
That's enough now!
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
You got a round figure on it?
Are you out of your mind?!
What about my money?
I knew this I knew it.
Be very careful.
Tell me what you said to him.
It's what you want?
I'll take care of ya.
I need some help.
You can take this.
Everything went to his head.
I did what you told me to.
I mean I did but then I did exactly what you told me to do and I came right back.
I would have.
And he'd've been right too.
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.
And he's probably got it there too.
See who I got in there.
Let me think about that.
you know somebody at the bank...
There's a lot of money in there.
Oh you're right I know.
well I was just -
I mean it's none of my business but I...
No I really do.
You're a beautiful girl.
And take it easy with this shit will you?
When I see him I'll talk to him.
But you know I think you should try to make the best of it now.
See what happens.
you know this is probably not...
But what does that tell ya?
About how much?
I went into this with my eyes open you know.
I'm a working girl right?
I never see - You know I never seen him act like that with anybody else.
I never saw him so happy.
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help so...
Very nice to meet you.
But I saw something...
I want my end.
' I made a lot of money for you.
I want my cut.
I told you I was hot tonight.
She started it.
She started the whole thing.
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
Get your bag!
Come on get your bag!
Get your things!
That's what he's -
So he knows where you are.
I just talked to him.
He called you right here.
He was just on the phone.
You're the mother.
We'll go later.
You got money.
That's a - That's a good look.
It means I got the money.
No I know that look.
Every time I ever see you that's what I see.
I mean it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now.
I mean this.
I wish you...
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
I'm always here for you.
You're in that place.
Are they out now?
There's no more.
God I'm telling you they're out!
There's more!
I know there's more.
You know why right?
Take him out!
No no no no!
What could you do?
Get her out of here.
Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure...
I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.
Yeah just let me know.
Yeah but I'm not sure yet.
You know what I want you to do?
I'm not sure yet you know.
But they'd never okay anything you know?
Yeah what's to stop him?
Yeah what'd you tell him?
Walk walk walk.
Get out of here?
So are we.
I do all the work.
I'm the one who's here.
But he never talked.
Yeah thanks a lot.
I mean you know they all worked it out together.
You walk past me?
I took care of everybody.
Come here come here.
Get him up.
Yeah I know that's why you had it ready.
No no I'm taking it.
All right yeah.
You got that thing for me?
Before you continue...
Then do it the way you want.
What can I...
And - An end has to be put to this.
But I - I -
Take it easy though.
I know it I know it.
I know but that's enough.
All right take it easy now take it easy.
behind my head.
And you know I got eyes...
There's a lot of people here.
Since when do you talk like that?
everything's here.
She's a friend.
Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
Works for me.
what's with the phone?
Hey Hot Stuff.
You'd help me...
Now let's go get this guy...
I'd love for you to...
Quite a pair we make.
I can tell..
How did this..
The important thing is we're together now..
I got home fine.
"" Whatever that means..
"" I'll be okay...
I'd better get you home...
it's it's...
You get one do you understand me?
You get one life.
"" If you are something then you better be out there doing something.
You're very special.
Why would someone like you want to go out with a...
what exactly am I again?
Hey hey the client comes first.
But of course you are.
Dinner at Eight.
So meet here at eight and go from there?
Would you like to go to dinner?
You're probably right.
What's the matter...
I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
It may be time to get the police involved...
I knew you had it in you...
I'd given up trying to find anyone.
But it's true!
You can call him yourself.
Yes did you call us here for any particular reason?
I better go report this in...
I suppose she does.
They do take their time.
There you are darling...
Lots of them!
God can you hear me!
I'm not done.
Hey speaking of Wrong Place Wrong Time.
Nine minutes and it's all over!
No one can get out.
I need something real.
I've been thinking about us.
I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days.
I hate to think we're just in this for the money.
I got her...
Ah did you hear that?
How could I forget.
Just like a woman.
You want out.
I hate it when you get like this.
I say we call it a night.
Tomorrow is a big day for us...
where is she?
Oh I like her.
I like her a lot.
I want to save this one for later.
Now he'll be up all night...
I mean look at you now running around trying to ""get to the bottom"" of things.
Trying to ""save the city.
Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?
Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
You've seen me...
You think so?...
I still have one left...
You've been through so much..
Oh please sir one more.
and those will be quite real.
""Save the City?
It's up to you to...
to save the City...
Oh man come on what do I look like?
For when the..
For when the time comes..
You're not strong.
Ask me another one--
What's the name of your child's best friend?
I'm a good mother!
Did you just say ""girls?
Believe me there's a difference.
Pay her and thank her.
I accept there's not much you can do about it.
I've been thinking..
I have some..
Yeah as in born before..
What's the good news?
I've got some good news and some good news.
We have to do something.
Let's get serious.
all this time my story is right there in front..
I have a lot of questions.
I'm not through.
Again to one of you.
Do it some more.
I thought maybe you and I could...
Hey I thought...
I said I saw you last night.
About the same.
Thanks for asking...
How's your hand?
You turned around!
Next time call...
How did you know to come here!
Oh now this one is mine...
Sorry I get carried away.
Oh I want this one.
I want her bad..
Yeah she's okay.
It's just I like her a lot.
""I'll go out with you.
If I let the cat stay will you go out with me?
Do you always listen to what your mother says?
Save the day..
You've said so yourself many times.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...
you have such pretty eyes...
You should see this...
It came this evening.
You're so different from what I..
and so the same.
I meant to tell you..
Why did you...
we have to start having a different conversation.
""Absolutely nothing""-- Has a ring to it.
You're the One.
I know you're a woman.
If you turn me down I just might throw a fit..
you know how us girls can be..
This is one way.
Can you let me pull over?
Give me some space to pull over.
I know he's there!
Everything worked twice as good without him.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
And we listen.
This is my conversation.
I'll say what I fucking please.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
Better let me drive.
You'll do all right without me.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
She might not be around to back up your story.
You could end up in the middle of this.
Will you two cut it out?
Did you have to tell her my name?
Now hand that on back!
Give me that phone back.
How was I in the wrong?
He's at it again.
I'm trying to help somebody.
What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
You could've made me lose my call.
I'll explain later.
I'm sort of on hold.
Who's on the phone?
Get this door open!
And then I want out.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.
Can you make him stop!
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
I let you take me out.
Sit down where you are.
You got it wrong.
I'm the one that's on your side.
On the job.
They'll wait.
Now turn around.
Jesus the shit you come up with!
What else did you expect him to say?
Look I've got a wife.
He's seen both of us now.
That's out!
What do you keep making me out to be?
First off this Mr.
If you know that just back off.
There she just picked it up again.
Not this minute.
Are you there yet?
I can meet you.
He took it like a man.
Take your hand out of there.
Know what else is in here?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
How about ""later?
But I knew you'd come through for me.
Who'd ever think to look at you?
I need a break.
I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Do you think they'll walk away?
No, there's a police car way back there.
It could be a fire.
Let me talk to him.
for the lot of you.
I'm still okay.
Let me see how easy you can turn it on.
Stop talking like that!
You could've hit me.
What's that supposed to me?
That's on their head.
All I did I was put him there.
I'm not trying to lose them.
Do you have to point that?
They already have a third.
There's no way out for you.
You have to deal with us.
Your friends are probably still on the line.
Pick it up and say hello.
Who's in back?
You knew about me.
Why pick me to be your mark?
I had it all.
The rest of the money is here in the car.
Why are you telling him that.
I have it now.
Hand me the phone.
I'm waiting for the girl.
Her mother wants to talk to her.
They put their hands all over me.
Probably all the wrong ones.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
She'll never be the same.
None of us will.
She'll be with you soon.
I could see it in her eyes.
Just start walking.
Walk to me.
You've thought this out better than I ever could.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
She's a child.
She might not come to me.
She might just run.
It's one at a time.
And you have to be first.
Is the tape off?
She's next.
In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Not with them.
Put the man back on.
He's in back.
That's coming off.
How about the girl?
What about your husband and your child?
I got you back.
Try what you did before.
It worked before.
I hear them.
They're coming upstairs.
I might be wrong.
Or somebody else there is listening in --
What kind of a person am I?
I've let him make her like that.
For the way you feel about your family.
Yeah sure that's me.
I might still get there first.
The lights are with me.
Someone went out.
There's a different car starting.
You're doing what you can.
What are they doing to her?
It's not hard to do.
I do it all the time.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do.
Do you know what's in that box?
That bank is our best bet.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm not doing too well.
Wait just a minute.
I'm trying to.
She's gone --
I've got to ask somebody.
That's not her.
There must be a hundred kids out here.
I can hear you again clearly.
I'm making my turn.
Make a right.
I've lost you.
You're gone.
It'll clear up.
I have no right to ask for help.
I've never thought of anybody but myself.
A price on everything.
It's just the way I am.
Shit stop with the money!
I was just doing this.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.
Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I sure as hell got my wish.
And that was the end of it?
How much time do you have left on it?
Tell me what she looks like.
Forget about us.
I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
It's just me and you again.
Will you please speak to me!
Just hang on.
I've got a life of my own.
Forget who I am.
He's right?
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
She'll get right in.
What do they need her for?
My God she's only nine.
I'm with two friends now.
They just walked out.
She's back on.
I hear them coming upstairs.
Are you still with me?
I'm in traffic.
There's no place to turn.
You could lose me for good.
I may lose you for a minute.
These people mean business.
It was so quick.
They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.
Where'd they take you to?
Then hang up!
I am not involved.
You'll get someone else.
My name is --
I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Just pick my number out of the air?
You may be our only chance.
Lady, try making some sense.
They might hear.
Will you let me explain!
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
What are you planning to do when they got here?
Put the girl on.
Seems like it.
Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.
Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
She's yours.
What are we waiting on?
That's how it is.
I back up again -- you pull forward.
Then we do it one last time.
Soon as Mrs.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.
So nine hundred to you.
You should've done all this before.
What the face value is.
It's in the process.
Then just wait.
While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.
And her little girl.
We're waiting on you.
It just changed.
Talk to the man.
You'll see her.
Fucking ""A"" it is!
Any argument and I'm out of here.
Nobody gets out.
Take my number.
We can be there.
It should take me twenty minutes.
Where are you coming from?
Where do we meet?
You got time on your side.
You're making it too easy.
I want half.
Who are you working for?
Nobody can do anything right but you!
I know my way around.
That's all mine.
Where do I turn?
How far off are you?
I can see the benefit in that.
I thought you'd know me by now.
There's two police cars now.
Tell the man.
Mind if I have a look?
Let her tell you.
There's no lady here.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Send me money!
business is this?
Can I make a quick call?
You could always make it up to her.
So who's he?
Ask him yourself.
I would expect he does.
Maybe he wants something.
An excellent quality.
Good thing in a man.
That's what he said.
What do you think his name is?
He agreed that he was.
She wants to know sir do you like your hair.
Now he can look....
Now that was a look.
What would you call it?
Saw that one.
What you think?
Just cut his hair you know.
He gave me a look.
Take your clothes.
It's Dave.
Then you're to go home like a good boy.
See they get the wrong idea.
You heard me --
You fucking did.
You know what I like...
Consider it how you like.
Whatever it is she does for you.
She's not that either.
No of course not she's a lady.
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's Jim.
Bloody right I do...
I'm sure you do Mr.
Not in my experience.
Two hundred quid Mr.
As the man said it's in my nature.
You're doing time for me.
No greater love as the man says.
Wish you'd tell me why.
I'm sorry darling.
Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Not if you go.
And you'll never leave me?
Say it again.
What would you do for me?
Then say it.
Let them come then.
Try and go then.
Got to be somewhere.
He asked me to see were you all right.
I suppose I tried.
Did you hear me?
You knew which man?
I knew your man.
I will be.
Are you supposed to take that many?
You mean that?
I was trying to get out of something.
I had to go to work!
What you doing?
You like me better like this.
So it's true then?
Want to make you into something new.
You want to make me look like him...
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
You'd do anything for me?
I'm sorry you know that?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
What's her?
Tell me what's wrong --
So I got it wrong then.
There's Dave.
He knew too.
That's true....
All right they do.
So they do know.
Do they know?
Will you meet me again?
Ask to meet me again.
Make it up to me then.
So I'm sorry.
I said stop it.
See I was always best looking after someone.
What you doing here?
He looks after me.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
I'm thinking of your man.
No depends on nothing.
Depends what it is.
Something I heard someone say once.
Want to look after you.
He did sometimes.
Did he come here too?
Like you're concerned.
Do you miss him?
What would he think?
Did you do that to him?
As different as it's possible to be.
He was different.
Sit down will you?
He lived here with you?
Someone out there.
I'm not on my own am I?
The things a girl has to put up with.
Make a pass or something.
Give me that look again.
But I'm not cheap you know that?
You want me to ask you in right?
He's getting up.
You on the game?
They all get the wrong idea.
Everybody wants something.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
That should make her happy.
And what's it like?
Guy I work with.
Long as she can keep it.
Well maybe you'll get lucky.
Young love as they say.
Ever so nice.
Do you now.
Need to go across the water.
You may be right.
We'll be on the other side.
We'll move when you do.
And what happens then?
You were made for this.
And what if I say no?
Then we'll leave her be.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
She's nobody.
And you've no idea how useful that could be.
No what is the thing?
Said we should find out what happened first.
No thanks to you....
What you think of the hair?
That's the last thing I'll do.
You never asked what happened.
He's hot.
Someone's got to do it.
I had him all over me.
Have a heart.
Have a look at him.
Did you give him it?
Hey -- what's he like?
Do you want some food?
See does he want some.
So it's on the street.
Thank God for that.
Aye I do Peter.
Just a girl.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
I thought it was Dave.
Who'd you think it was?
So it was you all the time.
Would make me feel better about it.
Why do you want to do that for?
Are you all there?
So he knows your name?
It's your decision.
But you're the only one he looks at.
Made the front page.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Give him a cup of tea.
But if I did...
Stop that talk now --
No I'm not good for much...
Tell me something anything.
I thought as a child.
When I was a child...
Tell me anything.
Just help me.
I told you not to talk that way --
Take the whole lot.
Take her picture.
See if she's all right.
But they will.
They have to.
I want you to find her out.
Tell her I was thinking of her.
Whatever she is.
Will you think of her too?
It's as simple as that?
Depends on what you believe in.
My special friend.
If this shit was all over.
Where would you most like to be now man?
I was right about you.
It's in your nature.
Means what it says.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Shut up would you?
Give us a break.
Now put it back in.
Now that was worth waiting for.
But not at home.
The kids play it from the age of two.
Best game in the world.
It was a job.
You could have said no.
I got sent.
That nice lady.
Maybe I'll get to understand.
She's a friend of mine
So what were you fucking around for then?
You make a nice couple.
Suppose you could say that.
She your wife?
She's mine.
She'd be anyone's type.
She's not my type.
No what's the funny thing?
And you know the funny thing?
And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
I'm talking about your people not you.
What do you know about my nature?
Not in your nature.
You want to bet?
Well I could say the same about you.
How did you know it was her?
So what do I look like?
I seen your fucking face.
Eat something would you?
You shut your face --
As it is you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
They could be looking.
I never know nothing.
What if I did?
And it's June.
No we are.
You in love?
He's in love.
Here -- it's yours!
All right -- where's the letter?
What makes you think they're even interested?
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I heard you I heard you.
I said tell me to go to the --
What a terrible thing to say.
How could you even think that?
Here give it to me.
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
You're the only one left.
I'm through listening to you!
You mean he's here too?
Now start looking.
Well you're right there.
Ten minutes ago I had a job.
I know but this is all we've got left.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner I think.
I'm on.
Of course there is!
Can you remember anything at all?
I think I found something.
Yes you told me.
You've got to be at work in the morning.
There's nothing more we can do tonight.
If only we could see it.
We're looking at it right now.
Let's look anyway.
Somebody would have seen it.
You've got it.
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
Well -- come on.
When you come on you really come on.
How do you think I got here?
Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Why do you think I brought you here?
It's all right -- look.
It's lovely.
Oh you should see your face.
I could eat a horse.
Is there a Mrs.
I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it.
Look around some time.
I want to know what it is.
Does he have the money?
Just a minute Mrs.
Then who's this one?
You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave.
Please help us Mrs.
It was our money and we want it back.
Please go on Mr.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
The five men.
The five men --
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
You mean you've known about him all along?
What does your Mr.
Yes but I lost him.
What did you want to see me about Mr.
-- in fifteen minutes.
Where are you now -- can you meet me?
You mean he might have -- Mr.
Well there you are!
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night.
Look for it Mrs.
You may not have a great deal of time.
Those men know you have it just as surely as we do.
You're the only one who could have it.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
The money -- Mrs.
Please do what we ask Mrs.
Have a good look.
Now look at this one Mrs.
We knew him of course by his real name.
So that was it.
What's all this got to do with me Mr.
Someone has to do it Mrs.
You mean you're --?
Have some please.
Come in Mrs.
You're quite late.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch.
And you've never seen him before either?
The last one please.
Do you know him Mrs.
The next face please.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
You did too say it -- I heard you.
I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Did you say --?
Well maybe we'd better forget about it then.
What's your first name today?
Starting with his own.
Then how do I know this is your office?
The lunch hour.
He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
When did you see him -- what time I mean?
We're not allowed to tell.
Here's mine.
Not my room!
It's all right with us --
They've got it I tell you!
But he'd have to.
Or you --  Or you --
Then who does?
And I say maybe you both have it!
She has it -- you know that.
The view had better be worth it.
Okay -- up there.
No -- he's not the same.
Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days?
But that left me without any honest means of support.
I can explain if you'll just listen.
Will you listen?
It's a start anyway.
No -- not yet.
Shut the door!
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Would you do anything like that?
I'd love some thanks.
This is good want some?
You're a big help.
Can I have one of those?
Did you find it?
Come on -- let's get busy.
That sounds like their problem.
Who told you to do that?
When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear.
There you said it.
Well there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
I'm not fifteen.
Oh-oh -- here it comes.
Which one are you?
There must be some way.
There -- you're a new man.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Okay I'll drive you around there some day.
Oh I want to believe you Peter...
They think I'm working with them.
He was my brother.
Well you know now so please tell me who you are.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
It's the only name I've got.
For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Please keep it.
Here's ten.
And the last one?
Forty-five thousand.
What's its value today?
Do you mind if I sit down?
What about the blue one?
I'm afraid it is important.
How much is it worth?
I know them as one knows his own face even though I have never seen them.
The man who bought them last week was American.
I did not see him but I heard.
You are American too of course.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Why bother him?
And if it is?
If it's not here why bother him?
But his mother --
I'm afraid that will have to wait Mrs.
No -- in my room.
I was too.
One more question.
Can I go now?
""  Not very much is it?
May I see it?
Perhaps he met somebody.
Is it all right?
It is all right.
Where did he keep his money?
He was American?
I'm very cold.
Would you be so kind as to come with me please?
No -- but I will ask.
But he is gone.
Do you have --!
It is up there!
I found it!
There is something!
If I can just -- yes I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
I would put it up there!
What should we give him?
I'll get you some here okay?
Yes of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Yes I'll remember.
Hey -- I'm on your side.
It was only words.
How do you know what they're doing?
I believe what he said.
Come on now --
So they think he left it with you.
But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Be careful Peter.
I'll be back in a minute.
Peter -- are you all right?
Do you know what's wrong with you?
If you're really in some kind of trouble I'd like to hear about it.
How about once more around the park?
On the street where you live.
What was what?
If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
You mean you and me?
What was all that?
Right there between your eyes -- see?
You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that.
I thought he was dead.
I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Where did everything go?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Are you in the book?
Well the idea's right anyway.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Is your husband with you?
You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size.
I'm not sure I --
Well you're honest anyway.
Please not on my account.
Is there a Mr.
Which view would you like?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Please stop -- please!
Come on now -- sure you do.
But what's all this?
He said he had never seen any like them.
What's he up to?
He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls.
What is it about?
Who is it from?
Have you no idea who could have done it?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
He knows everything.
He's the only husband I've got.
I tried to make it work I really have -- but --
We want that money -- now!
I'll need to use the phone.
He asked me to come talk to you.
I'm not fucking you.
I think it's funny.
As fucking if.
But she still looks like we're eighteen.
You always want to change the past.
is there anything you do?
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
Now get back to school.
Never mind darling.
You go back to school.
Who is she Daddy?
It was a she.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Not much further.
I have a question to ask you.
A personal question.
I want you to head right home after school.
You said that two weeks ago.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place.
If it happens just keep a man outside until you hear from me.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
We need you here.
I can bring her in.
You found her?
She just turned off her light.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I never met the woman.
I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
How old was she?
She died a year and a half ago.
She works at a church?
You know where I can find her?
I have something for you.
Your brother told us.
See where he is.
What he wants us to do.
I'll head over to the school.
We just found another body.
You gave me a 'D'.
You think you're my sister?
Yes that's the whole point.
This is what I was put on this earth to do.
I have no idea which one.
What do you know about my father?
You of all people should understand that.
From the moment we're born.
For your own safety.
You think I should go to the party Mr.
Then you should go.
You know about that too?
Can you just follow me?
The back is full?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together on the same night.
Especially not your dad.
The phone just went dead.
Not that many.
But I suppose that's a type of love.
Oh nice save.
Everyone wants to meet you.
Party with you.
That's his table.
You eventually have to talk to him.
Go sit next to him.
My life might have been very different.
Think I'm too old?
You heard about that?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Twenty eight years ago.
What year are you looking for?
What can I DO for you?
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Go to the police station!
My dad's down there!
Then go to the party.
Three kids are dead.
I want to go to this party.
This party is sick.
Stay We'll just talk.
Am I doing something wrong?
Let's just start a party right here right fucking now.
Are you coming to the party?
I kind of am.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I have to go home after school.
Come over to my house after school.
We'll go together.
I'm so sick of it.
When I got in late the other night my father was waiting up for me.
You know I want to go with you.
Please go with me.
I think it's really sick.
You know maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I got to get home.
You're already late.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
We both have...
THAT'S why he called Mr.
He was one of them.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Do any of them still live around here?
Against the whole town.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
And the police did nothing?
Things were different back then.
Years ago something horrible happened in this town.
When I was still in high school.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
I think she lived her a long time ago.
Like twenty-eight years ago.
When dad was eighteen.
I've never heard of her.
Maybe something else was on his mind.
Like I've never seen him act.
Did he say anything else about her?
Where did you hear that name.
You can ask me anything.
I need to ask you something.
His mother's an only child.
His mother's side.
On what side of the family?
He asked me to come over and talk to you.
I got to go.
Just thinking about something.
You're so beautiful.
No you keep one.
You can have both if you want.
Did you want one?
We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
I was not in the man's face.
What about all that ""no need to get in the man's...
You did help a little.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.
We're the shit.
Why'd you stay behind?!
What'd you come back for?!
Come on big guy!
They'll meet you at the top.
Hang on hang on.
It says forty- nine.
Forty-nine point four.
You'd better floor it.
here comes the...
I've got the real thing!
Forty-five seven!
Would you be more care-...
Go go go!
I'm a little
All right man.
Hey just shut up.
Bring him down!
Yeah I know I know.
Well all the same.
It was your friend...
Not completely anyway.
He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Not all-American or anything but not bad.
Got taken in the first round.
So you took his...
What about my needs?
piece of shit was worth.
Worth a try.
Hey put it back!
These'll keep it cold.
I made it.
I made it!
All right you got it you got it!
Come on old...
Left left left!
easy easy easy.
Go go go go go.
You think we can make what?!
we can make it.
All right you got it.
Well then that means it's call...
Shut up shut up!
I believe in live and...
Hey take a look at your situation and...
Nice job back there.
Ah one of them's in the back.
We're clear.
all the time.
It happens to this piece of shit...
Man I can talk all I want to.
That dog was mean before I met him.
What did you do that for?
What the hell is with you dog?
Look put this in the back.
All right then how about this?
You can stay here you can go.
I'll get more.
Wait wait wait.
Do you know what I think?
Yeah I believe him.
He was my friend.
No no no no no no.
I could always give you that.
He could've.
That-That's true.
He could've called first.
Since when does...
Hey I'm with you on that one my man.
No argument there.
Where do you want this stuff?
such is the price...
within five minutes.
Give it to me now or you'll be dead...
Maybe you know him.
But I can tell you this.
I did what I could for you...
Well that just about figures for today.
I've never seen this guy before.
I'd say we're about even.
We're about done here.
We've got it...
Take the boat?!
Any of them Richard Long?
After they put you away...
""  I like that.
But after you went away I--
always done Richard?
The sorts of things you've...
you were right of course.
Together you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
and the government.
The government did...
Is that why you're here?
You look fit...
You look good Richard.
There's nothing to say doctor.
I wish they would've let me say something...
My people are out there!
Your people are out there!
""I am become Death the...
You have my word on that.
And let me tell you something else.
Or I may be wrong.
Do you know what'll...
There's nothing in here sir.
They got away with it.
Hit him again.
He'll be more useful now.
Of which we have more than enough.
comes up that road.
LONG'S CAR - NIGHT.
What about these two?
quick in and out.
This was supposed to be a...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
I would've in another life.
You'd never understand!
You're a nothing nobody!
Dead last time I...
Bring him up.
You try anything it goes in...
never done a thing for you?
I want you to look at one another...
should be right outside.
Odd then that his car...
time to time yeah.
Yeah I know him.
He comes in from...
You on the other hand...
It gives him gas.
Of all the days for you to show up late.
His I know.
There's something else too.
It's after five...
You got thirty minutes.
I want it air-...
Get ready to take it out!
Here's what I want you to do.
All right let's move...
That's where we make our play.
Now you and your men back off.
It must've happened right after we left.
It could be a cover I suppose.
Run a check.
Have you I.
I will tell you what I...
try this one out some-...
Let me have those.
Yeah I just....
And what if it does?
Some people might.
-to a simple thing like...
and that power...
like a fish.
And I'm good at this.
but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
We're already supposed to be shut down.
Where are you now...
We've got the real thing!
All right go.
Yeah I'm sure.
He's right out-...
on the other end of this phone.
I said let me see your hands now!
Move the car!

We've got your whole record.
That's not the way I...

An honest living.
I make an honest living.
I'd like to be able to read across.
If that's what it says.
The future Mr.
Now where's the girl?...
How much better can you eat?
Oh my yes.
I want to know what you're worth.
Over ten million?
How much are you worth?
How do you do that?

He made this city.
You know what he used to say about them?

I'd like you to look at something Mr.
With her mother.
I've got her.
where's the girl?...
Just find the girl.
Just find the girl Mr.
I'd like to help her if I can.
If they'll help you remember.
What was the argument about?
Well It was about five days ago.
I let 'em practice up out here.
I'm old.
Exactly what do you know about me Mr.
Was he right?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job.
Come come Mr.
Far as it goes.
What do the police say?
I think I gave it to her.
How did she get that idea?
That's life Mr.
Yes sir that's what it looks like.
How soon can you get here?
You've got her?
I've got the girl.
You sure this is okay?
Okay you got yourself a boat.
I'll throw that in too.
Maybe an even hundred.
you'd have to leave tonight.
Tell her later.
I'll just tell my wife.
Sure as soon as we eat.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Care to join us?
How is everything?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Not for your wife.
You know you're okay Mr.
I know it's your job but you're okay.
When you're right you're right and you're right.
She's just no good.
Then what'll you do?
So he says what do they do?
Give us things.
How do they do that?
That's just lovely.
Well you own a lot of land.
That's her father.
Get him away from her.
Get him away from her!
Who is he get his name?
Let her go for now.
I'll explain it later.
Give you three minutes.
Well let's go.
I'll write it down for you.
I think she knows something's up.
Matter of fact I do.
I know what he says.
That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
And why's that?
Now how did he get that...
But if you want give me a day or two and I'll get back to you.
Now I'd like to go home.
happen to have them?
Yeah I took 'em.
How do you happen to know her?
When I do you'll hear about it.
Or her name?
I'd like to talk to him.
You seen him?
Looking for someone.
I get by.
You've done well by yourself.
Yeah they are.
Do you know where she might be?
On his day off.
I have to go home and get my things.
That's worse...
Walk out leave everything.
where are you taking her now?
so that's why you hate him...
care of me...
after she was born...
he took care of her...
I just want to see her once in a while...
take care of her...
my mother died...
I was fifteen...
She's my sister.
Now what's her name?
I'll make it easy.
You've had to pay her off.
Just take my word for it.
Now I want to know how it happened and why.
I mean yes probably.
What the hell is this all about?
They're expensive but you can afford it.
yeah soon as you can.
why do you want to see her?
Did you have lunch?
I'm not telling anybody about this.
Jesus Christ say something.
I'm not the police.
Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
That's not what it looks like Mrs.
You mean she just found out?
Then let's go talk to her.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Just wait wait for me.
That's what your father said.
You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Give me an example.
I want you to listen to me.
He wanted to know where she was.
It has to do with my father.
Look there is something I should tell you.
believe me it's got nothing to do with you.
And I want to know where.
Could you do anything about it?
Why was it.
So why does it bother you to talk about it...
As little as possible.
What were you doing there?
What's that Mrs.
Does this usually happen to you Mr.
I gave everybody the night off.
' Nobody's here that's all.
They may not know it but they are.
He died three weeks ago.
We got it baby.
About thirty million more than they paid.
No I think I'd remember.
Everything you can see everything around us.
It'll go here.
Do you and your father get along?
Well I mean yes.
Then it was over the water department.
Not over me.
Over the water department or over you?
Yes a little.
It was quite a while after.
Get my car please.
I think you better come with me.
I've got my own car.
No not for that one.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
It's difficult for me.
Now I think you know all you need to about me.
Is this all?
For very long?
You were seeing someone too.
Where you were when your husband died.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Did he know?
You'll have to explain that Mrs.
Well I suppose I am...
The money's fine.
Well how much would you like?
I'll send you a check.
Just a minute...
Please call first.
I'll stop by.
Look at it this way.
They were out to get your husband.
Now if I see him I can help him.
Did you talk this morning?
It's very personal.
Nothing personal Mrs.
Suppose they did.
You may if you can Mr.
so I'd like to see your husband.
Unless that's a problem.
I should talk this over with your husband.
the point is Mrs.
's a small town people talk.
Actually he's not.
My husband's at the office.
Would you like something to drink?
Now wait a minute Mrs.
Get me the Times.
She's no better than anybody else in this town.
Wait in the office for two hours.
You pick up the watch?
I think I got something.
What'd you expect?
That's his job.
Where'd he go yesterday?
You'll find one of those people.
That could help us both.
you were saying?
When did you come in?
Well I'm a working girl Mr.
Oh yes we have...
She says you know her.
Be happy to show you.
I wonder is it too late for us to have a look around?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
There's just one question.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Nothing to do with Dad.
It's me actually.
I just want to know who put you up to it.
I'll give you a few days to think it over.
Hard working have a wife and kids...
Please sit down Mr.
That's news.
Well look at it this way Mr.
You ought to be more careful.
He's working for us.
Well tell him I'll be back.
He never even kids about it.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
You see I'm Mrs.
Have we ever met?
Every night a different part.
When it comes?
When it comes.
What about the water?
few days ago...
It takes time.
Water and Power?
All right what's your husband's first name?
But I have to know.
Then go home and forget about it.
Now what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
I'm afraid not Mrs.
Yeah I'll do that.
Never heard of 'em...
But how about here?
No problem with me on the Job.
Along with Mr.
How did they get it away from him?
I take a long lunch.
All day sometimes.
Well I'm on my lunch hour.
Fifteen minutes ago.
And I'm late.
It's personal.
Has he been out long?
He's not in Mr.?
He'll be waiting.
So he says you sent them?
She said not to call her husband might answer.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
That's what you spent your day doing?
You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Felt real sorry for him with all his money.
Went there to get rid of it.
She was sixteen or seventeen.
Why'd she run away?
Well you never know do you?
Oh yeah it was a big thing at the time.
She must be about thirty-three thirty- four.
Ever heard of him?
But that's what you told your wife.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
I say it!
You 're young the world is yours!
And I'm old...
Then you go away one year two...
And when you come back everything's different.
that would have been terrible he would have died from it.
Listen to this one...
It was probably meant to be like this.
So now what are you thinking of doing?
And nobody knows where she is.
Did you ever see her again?
So it's better to shut up.
It's hot in here.
They tell me you never go out never talk to anybody.
No nobody came.
I'm here!
Sit down sit down...
Did she come?
In company it's better.
Then I'll leave.
How is it possible to see this television without film?
You mean right at the end?
If you figure it out let me know...
One day two days ten twenty...
You always have an answer for everything.
And the next time be careful how you talk.
There must be some way to make her understand!
They're not my words.
What you say is wonderful!
The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful.
Eh there's nothing to be done about it!
What's she like?...
Yes it's a girl I saw at the station.
Is there a woman?...
There is a woman.
Nothing there's nothing.
Now what can you see?
What is it what is it?
What's the picture?
I only found out that night after the last show.
Those are things you never forget...
Some day you'll have other things to do more important things...
That's right more important.
And I'll never forget it...
It's got to be sent to another town.
you get used to it.
Then you're happy too.
But how'd he do it?
Good for you...
I'm only saying this for your own good...
Now it's all different.
Times have changed.
This is not a job for you.
Only on Good Friday are you free.
Now listen to what I've got to say.
That's all I wanted to say.
When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
Of course I knew your father.
We let him in free.
How much did you have?
I've come to see the film.
So I can have these?
they stay here.
You must not come here!
And turn into a piece of...
But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
Oh yes father.
Now everything's clear.
You understand now?
You see it clearly?
I think about it a lot...
How is it possible for...
Right now of all times!
But coming back!
God's will be done.
Good morning father.
I'll never agree with you.
there is no future.
There's only the past.
We never did it when we were kids remember?
That's the way it went.
You should have kept your own.
You'll never know.
That's why I went away...
and never came back here.
I told him I'd take his advice.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story.
I never mentioned it to anybody.
But what's the point of talking about it?
you know him.
One or two.
I've got a son too...
he's older.
And you do you have children?
She's beautiful!
Of course I remember him.
You're still beautiful...
The son of one of his colleagues.
You'd better go.
Day after tomorrow morning.
So what'd they say?
I got back today.
That's nothing to do with it it's the car that's still being run in...
When you change your mind open your window.
I'll understand...
We'll talk about that later.
Yes nice day.
No particular reason...
Why are you running?
You never used to do that!
And I never asked for one!
You have nothing to explain.
I always thought that what you did was right and that was that.
It's nothing to do with you.
After all these years!
I put all your things in here.
Go in go in...
See how pretty the house is?
We did everything over.
It's not true!
It's not true!!!
I'll show you he's coming back!
Daddy's not coming back...
Then where's the money?
I've been looking for you all day.
Did you buy the milk?
It takes years to get there.
And years to come back...
Well it's hard to call an important person by his first name.
Six years ago this May.
No one came any more.
You ""know better than me Mr.
How long's it been shut?
One day'll be more than enough...
So what's that got to do with it?
Well the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
Only -  -  Can I say something?
It's wonderful Mr.
We certainly do.
Ask them to sit down Mr.
But please Mr.
Two hundred and one thousand six hundred and forty-seven.
Let's hope they like it there.
These'll be kept.
I will also provide them -
I'll write it myself.
It's a saying Mr.
All right but I'll keep these figures too just in case.
Have you got that Mr.
What does it say there?
We would have heard.
That's all right Mr.
He sure did Mr.
I rather like it myself.
That's fine Mr.
How are you Mr.
Oh yes it's already made up.
And the social.
You got that in?
I thought it was a good idea.
That's a long story.
Why'd he ever leave New York?
Just old age.
You ought to see Mr.
There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Nothing particular the matter with him they tell me.
Why I had no idea -
In case you'd like to know Mr.
Maybe that was something he lost.
He could tell you a lot.
He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
He saw to that.
I tell you Mr.
He thought she was great Mr.
He finished it.
He made an awful lot of money.
Who else did you see?
She was so -
I called her myself the day after he died.
I thought maybe somebody ought to...
Who else you been to see?
You're pretty young Mr.
You take me.
Maybe some girl?
There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
And now it's after the end.
Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Who's a busy man?
I'm Chairman of the Board.
I got nothing but time...
I've got to finish it!
I'm all right, Mr.
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr.
Most of the time?
He wanted you to.
He said to me just yesterday -
Do you, Mr.
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr.
They're like anybody else.
They got work to do.
They do it.
Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Such a party!
Do you Mr.
That looks pretty nice.
Sixty-two thousand -
You just made the paper over four times today Mr.
That's all -
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
That'll be all today Mr.
Right now I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr.
Have him tell Mr.
If we were interested in that kind of thing Mr.
There is no news big enough.
That's one of the things I think must be changed Mr.
The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
As long as I have to.
Ask them to sit down.
Are they standing for me?
Has he said when he'll finish?
I'm sure that's it.
I'd rather Mr.
Not that I care about him.
But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you Mrs.
What story Mr.
I think I understand Mr.
Just as long as -
I came here - and I made Mr.
There's only one person I'm sorry for as a matter of fact.
It's - all over -
He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them.
Almost two to one -
And if you think - if any of you think -
I suppose so but - I'm not afraid of the story.
It may not be about anything at all.
Good night darling.
Mother's with you!
Mother's looking after you!
Here I am darling...
Darling it's all right...
Mother's here.
Have they heard from father yet?
Has he seen -
What do you expect me to do?
What in the world -
We've said everything that can be said.
Of course they'll hear.
I'm not sorry.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.
I never knew till this minute -
Me or anybody else!
Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours!
Only love me!
You've never given me anything.
You've tried to buy me into giving you something.
That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.
No matter how much it cost you - your time your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.
And right now!
It's only money.
What you want me to want you mean.
What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me.
But you've never given me anything that -
I'm not just your wife I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.
I was once.
You've got no right -
You're not at home.
Half past eleven!
Of course we're different.
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
I said what time is it?
That's when you've got to make them.
Oh no that's all gone.
That's why I asked.
You're not in a show are you?
Mother did for me.
Is that what you want to do?
How old did you say you were?
You've probably got a lot of clothes.
And I know too many people.
You've been wonderful!
But you're close.
But you do look so silly.
I always like to see the funny side of things.
And you're so funny.
In the water.
They live here too?
Hey you should be more careful.
What's funny now?
You've got some on your face.
What are you waiting here for?
Get out both of you!
I've got nothing to talk to you about.
I'd like to show you -
You do anything you want to do.
If you want to know they've already decided.
Anything you say Mr.
Only we're talking now about what you are.
Not just my political life.
Or his mother.
It's all right dear.
People will say -
I think I'm the man to do it.
The trouble is Mr.
I just try everything I can think of.
He was dead...
Do you know what it means?
How did you get him to part with it Mr.
Not my wife - not either of them.
She can leave me.
As a matter of fact I've already left her.
Remember the working man?
That's why you keep me around.
It's all there ever is to it.
It's all there every is to anything!
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
As far as anybody's to know it's a holiday.
When they get back -
You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
I'll get you some coffee.
First of all -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I've got to think of her.
Now you're not making sense.
Look out that window.
They're true!
Everything I said!
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
You start tomorrow night.
""  I'll get us some girls.
I mean I've got a job for you.
I've changed the front page a little Mr.
That's what you think is it Jim?
That's the train with all the lights.
Go on Mr.
Well let's hope it's all for the best.
If I want to I can go to court.
A father has a right to -
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
That must have been love.
Maybe I should have.
Of course he built it for her -
Five years ago he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.
What's the name of that place?
I knew what it was all the time.
All he really wanted out of life was love.
Was he in love?
He knows the first Mrs.
I know about Mr.
I can remember everything.
Maybe you could remember something that -
But he kept it to himself.
He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.
we believe in something.
Right here Mrs.
Turn that thing off will you?
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
I'll get to it right away Mr.
Hold this thing up for a week.
Two weeks if you have to...
I know but -
They'll clear all right.
What do you think all that is worth Mr.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
But I knew how to take care of him.
That's the whole works right up to date.
You can learn a lot from him.
Monday with some of the boys from the office.
I feel kind of sorry for him all the same -
I just lost my money.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty believe me -
It just happens to be true.
He was in love with me.
I'd rather you just talked.
Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr.
All I want to ask you...
You mind yours.
I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Who told you you could sit down here?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.
Say you might be able to help me.
Why until he died she'd just as soon talk about Mr.
Will you have something Mr.
It's never too late.
Well if it's already too late...
This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
I'd say you're about nineteen twenty am I right?
Am I sure about what?
Am I sure?
The ones in this town yes!
What better place than this?
Yeah but not in here.
We're not moving!
That's it everybody out.
I'm buying some...
what's this?...
No I think I'll drink it in here thanks.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Do you really want that?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Have a good one.
I was here the whole time.
He was just...
ready you know?
He just sat there and let me do all the work.
He was mine first.
Nobody can figure it out.
Well there are but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
There's no light back there.
No this is great.
He went home to change for the big date.
So where is he?
Hey I was just about to order some dinner.
Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You might be let down.
Can I join in?
You can hold me down.
Can I watch?
My mother sent that in.
Call the police.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
Who went back there?
I just got back from outside.
That was so great!
I left like an hour ago.
I'm easy but I'm not that easy.
I have to go home first.
I think I've been on that one before.
A real date.
You mean on a date?
Let me take you out tonight.
Maybe we should just see what happens.
After all the talking we've been doing.
You work in a market all right.
I think it's time we got back together you know.
Believe me you'll get over it.
You want to date again.
They might hit it off.
-would like that.
But can we date?
So who's asking?
Look how full of yourself you are.
And I know that's what I'd become.
I'm giving him his ring back.
I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
But you were.
And you came here to what?
It's such a turn-on.
Was I right?
How like her.
Kind of sort of?
kind of sort of?
And you said yes?
But when we started talking...
What it's worse?
You saw it?
It took eight hours.
Let's not talk about that.
How'd you get home?
When did you get back?
She thought it was me.
That's when the girl found him.
Well he asked me for it!
I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Everything happened at once.
Wait a second?
Who was working here today?
What time was this?
This is the last time I ever come here.
Well he missed!
Sir I'm sorry!
He was trying to get me.
They certainly do.
Two fifty-five.
Are you open?
Give me a stick pretty boy!
That's easy to say from over here.
Like you're better!
I can pass!
In a second!
I want some service!
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
We got a little carried away.
This is the last time I come to this place.
I mean that's what a friend does am I right?
What's his name.
What's its name?
twelve minutes of game and it's over?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
You only brought one ball?!
I've got a responsibility here.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
you know you being a guy and all.
We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
If you want I can talk to her you know and explain...
Let you know.
after I get out of here?
Do you work tomorrow?
""I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Without me either.
It's not like I'm miles away.
To talk to you.
You were over half an hour late.
Then all you do is come over here.
Like ten after.
What time did you get to work today?
What did I do that was so wrong?
Why do I say that?
You can so.
Make them change.
Yes I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true.
The dead guy?
She'll get over fucking the dead guy.
Things happened today okay?
Am I right or what?
You're twenty-two!
Oh like your life's any better?
There are other jobs and they pay better money.
As if it's that easy.
I'm talking about this thing you have...
I was born.
You know what the real problem here is?
Why do I have this life?
What the hell is your problem?
I think four.
Around three or something.
She said she did all the work.
I told her that.
There's no lights back there.
You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I'll read the book.
I'll think about all of that later.
You've had quite an evening.
She went home to tell her mother.
You're happy to get a fine?
You're happy?
Then how come you got the fine?
Maybe five years old?
Get to work.
Please get the hell out of here.
If you must.
So they'll put her back in!
Nobody's there.
I never tried it.
Like you said you know.
Yeah but at what a price.
You've tried it.
Shut the hell up.
Twenty-two; same as us.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
She meant nothing to you!
If you go I go.
You hate people.
I have to go to this.
One night only.
What about tomorrow?
The next show is at four.
It's today.
He found out this morning.
They come all the way here...
for one ball!
We're not playing in the street.
Look who you're asking here.
Can we not talk about this?
No argument here.
I told him I had a game today.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit?
You always back down.
Not a fucking word!
Can you believe this?!
Can you come next door?
You know who I can do without?
Why do you do things like that?
Can we talk about this later?
What kind of show?
I'm not even supposed to be here today.
She's in here?
And the second time around...?
There's more?
It would stand to reason yes.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
and she's looking to me for support.
No no I'm listening.
I'm talking to myself here.
Oh shit I've got to place an order.
You think things would be any different now?
She picked the wrong one.
She had no idea I was even at the party.
Eight and a half?
Eight and a half.
I wanted to use your car.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty?
I was trying to call for a half an hour.
What time do you have to stay till?
Shit if I'd known you were working I would've come even later.
Jesus Christ what next?
Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Just the paper.
Hey man that was a long time ago.
When did all this shit happen?
Wait a second!
You went to high school with her?
They are not.
Oh I do.
She sure goes out of her way.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time?
You used to go out with her?
Hey man what happened with that old guy?
So why do you sell it for so much more?
I should get it at Food City.
How do you figure...
I work just like you.
I should start.
We get off about the same time every night.
We should hang out.
You get high?
A half hour.
Pay the good man.
One seventy-nine.
Hell yes whatever that means.
You make sure this gets back.
Actually that's his night job.
They show more in that one.
No I mean the ones there.
You know you probably could've been home already in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Thanks young man.
The white kind.
I understand but can I use it.
Well that depends.
No he got hit by a bus.
And having him tell me...
Of course not; not now!
I mean it was never really like that...
Would you let me explain...
It was only a few times...
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
I'll see you when you close then.
Can we go out and get some coffee?
What time do you get finished?
And that made you feel better?
I had to tell someone.
You had to tell him.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
What the hell is that anyway ""something like thirty-six?
SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Something like thirty-six.
Shut up a second and I'll tell you!
Let it go...
I did understand!
We went out a few times.
You never mentioned him!
He gets off on it.
Why do you call him that?
Why are we getting up?
Jesus would you stop?
I wish you'd go back to school.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
You men make me sick.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Why'd you hit me?
What the hell was that for?
How many different girls?
How many what?
Just ""being there""-as you put it-is not enough.
And I actually date you?
What about what we do for you?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change?
Or even paying for what they take?
People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
How much money did you leave up there?
Oh be real!
Now come on.
What were you doing up so late?
What time did you get to bed?
I'm only here until twelve then I'm gone.
Why did you agree to come in then?
I hate this fucking place.
All right stupid question.
I'll throw this out.
I think it's coming now...
You said you were here all day?
What is this about?
Can I have your name please?
Wait there's more.
Oh shit look who it is.
He's moving to the big city next week.
I like the way you think.
She told you about that!
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
Now feel his.
I do about three-fifty four.
I think the lady called it.
You'll be missed.
I'll see you at that party.
I'll see you there?
That's the price my brother.
He has his friend do it for him!
I can leave.
he told you all of this?
Like hell you are!
I'm getting that tape.
I've been here for half an hour.
You came for that too?
I would've went to Big Choice but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
I've been here since eleven.
It's almost eleven- thirty!
I just talked to her on Monday.
You work here now?
Man I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey let's get something straight.
Answer the man.
Where's the radio?
So what do you see?
You keep it.
Give him the money.
I know you did what you could--
She went for help.
If you can get away.
If you want do it.
What the hell do you know about bad time.
Look it was a bad time for everybody.
We'll never know will we?
Well you were wrong!
It was your weight on the line that did it--
I did what I thought was right.
You did it your way and she died.
Look I know--
I'm here for the same reason you are so let's do it.
You're gone now!
When we get this group down I'm gone.
Now let me fill you in.
What the hell are you doing here?!
No stay off the line!
I'm coming out!
I think it's out.
Hey anything for a friend.
Use your other hand!
I'm here--I've got you!
Please -- oh no -- please!
I'm sorry for all the trouble...
by eight you'll be there.
Please can I think about this for a minute...
Okay I'm sorry it's fine.
Is it really four thousand?
There's a lot more where that came from.
What about you?!
Now go back and get help!
Enough's enough.
How could anybody in their right mind...
then again you never were in your right mind.
For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
""Time is money"" -- please.
There's no ""we"".
There's a me.
We might be able to go that way.
It's the only chance!
He has no idea!
Can you see light?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
A simple yes or no would have done.
We have to get through to the other side.
Sure just give it back when you're done.
everything has to change.
Remember the first time we came up here?
What do you think they're doing now?
Do you know what people would do for that?
You know me I'm a night person.
Yeah let's go.
For the same reason you did to help.
If they show they'll take you too.
Why'd you have to come up here?!
You got to go back now!
you came back.
What are you doing here!?
I only came back for you.
That's not the issue here those people are.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can they'll never make it down.
You know where everything is...
You come back after being gone almost a year and you expect me to just leave...
If you want I'd like you to come with me...
Listen to you...
Which could maybe what?
You held on as long as you could.
Had to leave?
Believe me we all wanted to leave...
but you know what?
I'm trying to figure out where to start.
We spent a night there one night...
You can stop right there.
He knows it well.
Do you see them yet?
Never could save a thing.
You must be great with numbers.
The game's over--you lost.
You said there was a way across.
Nobody's worth that much on the open market.
No he's gone.
No wrong answer.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Half a day.
He asked you how far?!
Have her come up.
What's your names?
Then it's a deal.
Where's the rest of the team?
Hold on baby he'll get you.
You're out of control son.
What the hell are you doing--
Do you always transport through the air?
Who the hell ever is.
Get off the radio!
No names this is an open line!
You got what we need?
Is it set?
The hell with the money.
Where's the next one?
Looks like your friend found company.
How's your health?
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
We agree on something.
There what's that place?
Ask the questions.
I never ask twice.
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.
Long time is right.
Officer call me.
He said it was a very good way.
The old days are dead and gone.
He goes down.
He are here!
best not to say more.
We've been working hard too.
No no my boy.
This will be these people now.
They're very very important people and they're interested in you.
Who are they sir?
Help me sir?
They want to help.
I'm sorry to hear about that sir.
Your wife sir?
Has she gone away?
used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me sir.
I hope that's alright sir.
My heart goes out to you poor poor boy.
Yes sir that's exactly who I am sir...
and what I am...
I know who you are!
Dear dear dear.
Whatever happened to you my boy?
They look at each other.
What the bloody hell do you want?
I'm very sorry but I never open.
I suggest you use that.
Well shall we get down to it?
What would you like to know sir?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Well as I've said we've heard about you.
We are interested in your case.
We want to help you.
Fine sir fine.
Feel like talking to us.
Much better thank you sir.
I suppose you might call it that sir.
Very kind of you sir.
Very pleased to meet you.
So this is the young man?
Nice to see you Dad.
I've got to be off myself now.
I've got to rest Mum...
You've not been to school all week son.
Say it brother sir.
I've just come back from the hospital.
Not true sir.
Nobody's got anything on me brother sir.
What gets into you all?
Anything wrong sir?
No time no time yes.
Sit sit sit.
Oh or certainly by this evening yes?
I met your mother on the way to work yes?
well put it this way...
I feel very low in myself.
Do you feel that way now?
That is correct sir.
Oh well it's...
It's alright thank you.
Brother you think and talk sometimes like a little child.
And what will you do with the big big money?
Have you not everything you need?
What's this about a new way?
Let me hear more.
That's part of the new way.
One I think you will like...
Have I made myself clear?
What do they call you at home?
What job and how much?
We shall see to everything...
Where is he now sir?
I can tell you that I...
We tried to help you.
I think you know who those are.
Yes I can...
Oh look let me do that for you shall I?
Good evening my boy.
Was I alright sir?
Did I do well sir?
No sir I feel really great.
Let's hope you make the most of it my boy.
Thank you very much for this chance sir.
There there mother it's alright.
It said they had done great wrong to you.
and when you think about it son...
your home's your home when it's all said and done son.
Well all this needs thinking about son.
Not just like that can we?
A contract it is two years.
This is my home also.
That was all took away son by the Police.
No thanks Mum.
It'll pass in a minute...
What have you done with all my own personal things?
That's what he is...
Oh aye aye.
Well still the same old place then eh?
Well - I'm back.
Well how are you then?
There's a good boy.
Let me get up.
if you want to start...
well you just start.
You want to know why I did that well you see - I do that...
Why did you do that brother?
I've never done wrong to you.
Why do you say that brother?
You're absolutely right sir.
Blue eyes yes sir.
Fair hair sir.
Yes sir Church of England sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Pick that up and put it down properly.
Right carry on.
I never used to feel sick before.
Well of course it was horrible.
But it was horrible.
But we have to be hard on you.
It's quite simple really.
Oh no nothing of the sort.
Indeed it is.
And when do I get out of here then?
It's not that kind of a test.
How many did I get right?
Is that the end then?
Well that's all there is to it.
You can do whatever you like with these.
You know what you can do with that watch?
I want my money back.
I just say what the other person would say?
You'll tell me what you think the person would say.
Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
No no boy.
I see that it's wrong!
You must take your chance boy.
The choice has been all yours.
Let me be sick...
I want to get up.
Get me something to be sick in...
Stop the film...
Please stop it...
Stop it please...
Give it to him.
I've never seen you before.
I never forget a face!
I never forget any face be God!
It's no world for an old man any more.
What sort of a world is it at all?
I could never stand to see anyone like that whatever his age might be but more especially when he was real old like this one was.
I only know I want to be good.
I just want to be good.
These things get around Father.
Where did you hear about this?
It's nothing like that Father.
It's about this new thing they're all talking about.
Certainly my son certainly.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
I've done my best have I not?
You have my son.
Father I have tried have I not?
Fine my boy fine fine.
Face the wall.
Leave to carry on sir please?
We have the start.
Big big money.
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea son?
here and there as it might be.
Yes I heard.
Shall we go to my office?
I agree sir.
Just stay right where you are!
Call the police!
Where are you what floor?
In my office?
I'll get out of the building...
Just listen okay?
I think you need it more than I do.
It'll help.
How often you go?
But I take little ones all the time.
When was the last time you took one?
get your head straight...
you know get it together...
Just had one.
Like you I'm good at it.
But not now?
You like what you do?
There were two of us.
Have a party.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
You were right I was wrong...
I got lucky with the lights.
First Friday of the month?
They're in and out in twenty minutes...
which means they left fifteen minutes ago.
You want to sit down?
How about a break?
Then let's have it.
I know the answer.
If by some chance I get this wrong...
What other kind is there?
What kind of question?
With a job to do.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Right here in this very room.
Remember what you played?
My heart about stopped.
But I got up there all the same and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
You get to talk to him?
Better than great it had to be...
That's how he was you see.
The man himself.
Being around the music that was the thing.
And I was.
Take this one night...
By the way.
Hell make it fifty.
Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Twenty five percent.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?
You think I'm that stupid?
Tell me what you think.
But my children they're still young.
That was Black Peter's job.
And they would never be seen again.
And you ""lost"" it?
Take him down.
Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
if they're wrong?!
What if they're wrong?
Pick me up in five minutes.
Two in one night?
I never bought that.
Remember that thing a few years back?
Where's a body?
I come here find this.
I'm in town for a short time.
You know he started with nothing?
Look at him today.
I like to think of myself as more of a friend.
Tell my son.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Happy to meet you Mrs.
And what's your name?
It was nice to meet you.
I came to see you you look fine.
I'm standing right here.
He paid for 'em.
Oh thank God hey!
Get him on the line please.
Jesus what is with this guy?
Who the hell is this?
I know you're out there!
Where you been the last two hours?
I have to work with him...
why is everything always about you...
That was brilliant.
And I never saw it that way...
I should have done that.
Get out from under what I been under...
It never will.
Open your eyes in the morning?
So how'd you get that way...?
Get with it.
that's us.
Lost in space.
Then what are you?
That's the ""why.
""  That's the why?
There is no reason.
No good reason; no bad reason.
That's the reason?
How do I know?
What'd they do?
And you believe me...?
That's what you said...
You're too good.
There you go...!
I did four.
What's at Union Station?
Head towards Union Station.
It's what I do for a living.
Yeah so what's wrong with that?
No not just that.
Why'd you have to do that?
One day it's gone.
Your lady friend.
The one who gave you her business card.
Would you have called her?
That you do.
Paid sick leave?
How long have you been a hit man?
You said it yourself.
I'll just hold onto it for you.
In case they check.
How many others you got?
What no insurance?
I've always been good.
Ever since I started.
Go figure it all out...
He was my first.
I had a father like that.
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
That's bad.
And that's not good...
You go every night?
She's in the hospital.
Show up for what?
Get your thinking straight.
What you mean, no?
That's funny, coming from you.
I'll ask a question.
That's not living.
That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.
That what we're doing?
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.
But, hey, some good news.
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I need the job.
He's the Man.
I'll deal with it.
I will, I will...
Think of his kids.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Get rid of 'em.
Yeah, like that...
Oh, it's okay, then.
I only met him the one time.
What'd he do to you?
Life is that way.
I'm not up for this...
Tonight it is.
How long you figure?
Okay try it now.
I tried it.
What about that?
You listening to me?
I'm trying...
Get in the fucking car.
His hand moved!
It's just a dead guy.
On three ready?
Help me out here.
Since he has two.
I think he's dead.
We have a deal.
I'll make it an even five hundred.
Two two-fifty.
How much you pull down on a good night?
Lucky with the lights.
Twenty-four minutes!
Man you're hot...
But I'm working on other stuff...
This job's a fill-in.
You should start a union.
It's not that kind of job.
You on some kind of work plan?
Read about this one guy.
Think about that.
Place gets to me.
First time in New York?
Mind if I time you?
What do I get if you're wrong?
Not twenty-five?
Or twenty-three?
Twenty-four minutes.
How long you think this'll take?
Yeah yeah sorry...
Any special reason?
Look I'm sorry --
You turned up a one way street!
The guy came right at us!
I never told her.
I love her so bad.
She must be some girl.
First time ever.
It's up.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.
I spent two years here.
You knew just what I was there for.
Without a love of my own.
You thought I was bad.
You got to get out of here.
He took your picture out to look at it.
He called you his baby.
He was looking into getting him out.
My dad felt it.
So I started watching your father.
If that's love it's not so bad.
I found a part of myself that day.
That's the first time I saw you.
Then tell me what happened.
I know what it's like.
It's all I think about.
Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Is that why?
At a horse show.
Where were you the day he died?
Is that what they told you?
My father's house.
He only had two names.
I'm the one who left it here.
But first things first.
Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you?
Now's not really the time to get into this --
How it was possible.
Would you I mean could you love me then?
If I was normal.
Oh Christ here it comes.
And I know how I feel.
If that's what you want.
Okay I will.
Do you watch the news?
Read the paper.
What was he doing down here?
I mean come on.
You heard of him?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
They want one thing.
That it was only a matter of time.
And now four people are dead.
Maybe you better not try...
He's the last on the list.
You'd think I was making it up.
Not since your dad died.
You run with your back to the picture.
Like you were trying to get away.
Not this again.
Please put it down.
That was him.
Is this your dad?
How is it possible?
So what's the question?
The one on the wall.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Has this happened to you before?
Was that who I thought it was?
I've never read it.
I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.
You got a list?
You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Third issue this year.
This would be it?
If that's okay?
Believe you about what?
So why are they after you?
And look here.
Explain that one to me.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Six months eleven days.
Nothing is easy.
That's how a man would do it.
I'm not a man.
People more serious about their work.
You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Sit up so I can see you.
What took so long?
You were in there all day.
Could we go?
they want to see your body.
You expect me to believe what that someone came in here last night.
Gave that guy...
something that stopped his heart?
It's just something that happened.
Or I'll be dead by morning.
You've got to listen to me.
Was waiting till I knew you better.
You've been in my office ten times.
How come you never asked me about that picture before?
What was your horse's name?
I think you're different.
The President's in Europe.
What does it have to do with the President?
So why do you keep the picture up?
You've never seen her run.
It's a moment without hope.
Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
Could you be a little more specific?
Who else knows what you know?
You can see her.
I want to make sure she's okay.
You made your decision yet?
I'm not sure what you mean.
Not a man.
I know the story.
It was my father's.
So you'll believe what I tell you next.
Why are you telling me all this?
I'm still listening.
Yes that's right.
These things you're talking about.
And what did I say?
But not the research.
Ask what you can do for your country.
That kind of thing.
It was mind control.
That sort of thing.
Only on the football field.
It was horrible.
Then he started coming to see me.
That make sense?
What was the question again?
You've asked me that one three times.
It was my dog.
And you feel bad for it?
What do I look like to you?
Night after that?
So you doing anything tonight?
What I saw yesterday I know not to ask questions.
We're out.
That you come with me.
Either one could be bad.
I was just making sure.
What gave me away?
I want to believe you too.
We'll be right down.
Can I talk to you a second?
Have a good night.
It's his show for now.
Look you want to get some dinner?
I was just thinking that.
Here to I.
While we walk.
wants him for.
Get her out of there.
tell me something Doctor.
Why do you think they would go to all this trouble...
Is it possible...?
As your father?
What in the hell...?
Some of us have been a little...
not concerned exactly but...
How's the new office?
For giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you.
What would you have me say David?
But that's not who I am.
You do what you have to do.
And in the end as with everything it comes down to power.
Maybe they are.
They knew our level of development.
I'm asking for your help David.
It'll just take a moment.
Actually I'm running late --
Do you have a minute --?
You were right all along.
It's good advice.
This could be a chance to win him over.
As for why...
But it's over now.
Well I do care.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
I'm coming at this wrong...
It's how I hear it.
Thank you Doctor.
Is it possible.
Please answer the question Doctor.
All I have are the same questions you have.
I'll come right to the point Doctor.
It's time to go home now.
Please -- if you...
Eventually you'll get here on your own.
do we get to come back?
Others of my kind I mean.
why so soon?
you go home.
What happens now?
and now we're a part of it.
Am I one...
Can you help us?
But we always try.
You have your mother's hands...
Think of us more as...
Some never make it this far.
there are others?
We were simply listening.
Well not like you at all actually but...
So who -- what -- are you?
We thought this might make things a little easier.
But you're so...
I mean how could you possibly...?
I've never been here but I remember...
You might ask that about anything.
None of this is.
But tell me how did...
I mean how can...?
But you can ask more questions in the morning okay?
Could we hear God?
Maybe on a clear night.
Find out where he is.
But what do I say?
It's all right -- I like it here.
Come; I want to show you something.
Oh not quite yet.
I hope it's not.
it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
As if it never happened.
Do we have a deal?
That would seem to be the question of the hour.
I want to build it Doctor.
But a machine that does what?
and at the end of each...
That's my girl...
What could I possibly have that you would want Mr.
I've found it.
Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
What kind of deal?
You're here so we can do business.
I want to make a deal.
Why am I here Mr.
Anyway I've had my fill of life on the ground.
You live here.
Please sit Doctor.
Anyway it is what the whole world wants no?
This is the big show.
The sort you put on better than anyone.
More than anything.
I'd say this is slightly different.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!
The tape -- it's all there if they'd just look at...
How long was I gone?
Peter what are you talking about?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
but you're okay.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Like it or not.
It's really happening.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things I'd follow you anywhere...
I'm serious about this Peter --
Maybe that's the problem.
I want kids.
A real life.
It's what I want.
But the work --
But what about your research --?
We could be together again --
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could --!
God I've missed you.
Keep it down okay?
It's brilliant.
That's what they all say.
Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
Something my dad -- they -- said.
Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
In other words.
Tell them it really happened.
But it has to be real.
It has to be true.
Have you seen what's happening out there?
The people want to hear your story they need to hear it!
You tell them your story.
As it will everyone else's.
You're sure you want to?
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Just to find you.
I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
In fifty years?
What are you so afraid of?
Maybe that's okay.
I do seem to be...
I brought you something.
I said some things...
And ever since we've been doing great.
An excellent question Doctor.
Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.
We should go back.
It's getting late...
I thought it was well-written.
When I had my...
I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story...
It's what my whole life's been...
If you came back.
If you came back...
Explain this to me one more time...
Did you love him?
I never knew my mother.
My father died when I was nine.
Do you love your parents?
You may not believe this...
but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.
Of course I want to know God if there is one...
but it has to be real.
Can you try?
It's an old story.
And that's about as far as words'll go.
And mind yes.
Make that two.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I agree with Mr.
Have your department make a full report.
That would seem to decide it.
Like it or not for the moment anyway it looks like we're all in this together.
We made a deal ---
I got two years.
Another week almost made.
Work up top.
Real easy job.
Oh I had me some high old times.
Was we wrong?
What I done with myself is my problem.
Did you have them both at once or --
Tell us about it.
I got my mind right.
I got it right.
She's got him!
She's on to him.
Well you got yourself some time now.
We got one who's got all of it.
It's all up to you.
After a while you get used to it and the time --
Man I already done eight.
Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
That's my baby.
A cold drink?
You mean one cold drink?
A cold drink.
You'd start getting ideas.
Maybe even pass right out.
Two of them.
Let him eat.
How far did you get?
So then you just call him.
Oh man did you see her?
She looks just like Mrs.
Just play it...
Like I always do?
They got us boy.
Is that your answer Old Man?
I only had two more years to go.
You do the rest for me.
We're together you and me just like always.
They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Look at Him go.
what's the matter with me?
Fifty's a nice round number.
Why'd you have to say fifty?
Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
That's the end.
Where'd the road go?
You're making me look bad.
Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Where do you get that?
I thought you knew boy...
what was it...
Give it back here!
Wish you were here.
What's the writing say?
Eat it there boy!
You just said he could eat anything.
You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Oh no man!
Man it's so hot.
No more than five.
For a cold drink.
That's all there was.
Open your eyes.
Now get out of the way.
Give me some air.
Cost me a week's pay.
That is one mean lady.
Man Oh Man.
But you're dog enough.
You think you've been working hard.
Now look what you did.
I hate this...
None of your fucking business.
It's almost six.
This has got to...
I've got a date.
Look out for her.
Oh God I forget.
Poor thing you ought to get out.
Will you be okay?
None of you know anything about it.
I'll get coffee.
That men used to want me...
He'll be back.
If you want him.
You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I must have looked horrible.
Just take a look.
You look under the bad.
I'm three years old.
I know it was him!
And I got another call.
He said ""You and me you and me.
I had no music all the way to the market.
I got it myself...
It's just under seventy right?
It's always on.
Do you have to tell her about it now?
Leave those here.
If you really want her help.
I mean if you really do leave them.
Let her see them.
Give her a couple of hours.
I know about this.
You talked to me.
Shall I shut the door?
Make your coffee?
When he was seventeen.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
The same as the first time...
How do you know that Doctor?
'  I asked you what you thought not what he did.
Tell me what you want me to say.
You get me out first.
Shut up -- I'm talking.
She's supposed to have it.
Send the book to evidence...
The door was already open...
I brought a present for the lady there.
I'm looking for her to give her the present...
And maybe you're right that's the place.
Listen you want my advice?
You hear I found Jesus?
It's maybe better I stay here what do you think?
I'd like to know where he is.
Right now I have a question...
It's real well- written.
You should read it -- you're in it.
You read it yet.
Do anything you want to me.
I give myself to you.
I could love you.
I know what's coming now.
""Let me help you...
And I am one of a kind.
We'll keep talking.
Until they get here.
You know where.
I want it to end now.
I'll come -- just let her go.
She's not important.
That's the important thing.
Oh I think you will.
You have to come to me.
Where are you Peter?
You like that action?
You've got to let go.
How do you know it was him.
You never met him.
I called him...
called him a name...
Where is the head?
Are you looking for it?
Oh God why him?
This is the first person close to me who's ever died.
I'm working on it!
Maybe you should...
And after that...
Where's the john?
I thought he was a boy.
you know why?
It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.
He felt sorry for me.
He was a darling man.
Of you both!
What happened to you?!
They're not talking to me.
Look at the order he's doing them...
Just give me a minute here.
You're young.
What's that music.
This one yes.
And if you do there'll be another one.
And one after that.
He's playing a game with us.
That's exactly...
I could have taken that same picture this morning.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
So that's that...
I turned it off.
It's all different but it seems so -- the same.
Something's wrong with it.
Then what do you need me for?
We've got another one.
A whole new book thought up in a minute.
His all of them!
You keep my name out of this.
You make any sense in that?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.
I just came from her...
They get into my head.
Do you remember what you saw?
We'll show that to...
Please just take it all away.
If you knew why you might know where to look for him.
Now I've done what you asked me.
I've seen this hand before...
Will you go.
I think you are.
Oh my God no!
Nobody ever comes here.
Would you want to work with us on this?
You're absolutely correct.
If he's not out why are they here?
I think this is number three...
I was very good at it.
You know how to use this?
I know baby.
They all have one...
Will you stay?
in my head...
Tell me what to do!
Another time then.
The problem for me is...
I did once.
And then one day there are no more.
Did he just stop?
And you never know.
'  What's the rest of it?
He's brilliant.
This one is brilliant.
It just did that...
Let me get a little action started here.
It's a game they like to play.
I'll drive you down...
Make them some coffee.
Especially late in the day...
Now I want to say a few word to you local people.
Who came in after you?
Pick up anything?
I'm over here?
What's your name Officer?
Good police work.
your head together I wish him dead.
I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Park was full of them last night.
Where did he pick her up?
Yeah you did that too.
And you used that.
Yeah everything's different.
This is something new.
Not the same guy that's for sure.
She's blue as hell.
look at this...
Let's get out of here...
I like women like that!
I'm sure she thinks it is.
No she can come in tomorrow...
There's something I want you to think about.
To what end?
You want mine too?
You take his you take mine.
If he knew you did that!
You have no authority to make a deal like that.
How'd you get in on the deal?
What the hell you need her for?
You sure you want to be in this line of work?
It's not the same guy.
So what have we got?
there's no such thing as a little help.
We could use a little help.
""Let me help you!
Get out here.
Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm just giving you the news.
What are you looking at that for?
I said you were...
Talk to you later...
We were together six years sir!
She's not your responsibility.
That's the problem...
It's only beginning.
I'd like to go back.
where is everyone?
They've all gone away.
I thought that was you up there.
I'd better come with you then.
Are you sure you can drive?
You'd better drive him.
I'll follow in my car.
Where is yours?
Tell me what you would do.
Which hand would you hold it in?
But when he's in that car...
In that car?
Maybe I am a little.
James I've got to leave for the office.
I thought she might come along.
How can you drive?
I feel too close to her.
What about his wife?
The woman doctor?
I wish I had.
My car not yours.
They brought the car here?
And her husband?
What was he?
She's here somewhere.
You're getting out of bed tomorrow.
They want you to walk.
Not a lot of action here.
There that's better.
I had to go back to the set...
Did you come?
Anybody could have walked in.
Only in cars?
Please finish your story.
This is his show.
He talked to you at the hospital.
I like to look at it.
""Anywhere"" I said.
It's much worse now.
There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Look at all this traffic.
I'm not sure I can deal with it.
It's rather stupid of me.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people I've already found.
I think we saw each other at the hospital.
They said it was here.
They told me this morning.
What does he want from you?
You have to understand...
I can drive.
We made love.
Are we allowed to park here?
I need to talk to you about the project.
I thought that was your project.
that is my project.
I'm not sure I understand why.
The case could be made.
Is that why you drive this car?
You could get your wish at any moment.
I live in my car.
Do you live here?
It's not the police.
It's the Department of Transport.
They have no idea who we really are
Thanks an awful lot for everything and for coming down here to see me off.
So we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday.
Then you should call.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you.
Really think about it.
First you tell me to do what I want to then you tell me to stop.
He's been in and out of...
Then that's even more reason to listen.
I care about Michael.
What about Michael?
Do you know the extent of his...
Do we have to talk about this?
It's hospital policy...
I did this already.
I was so sure.
I really thought it would work.
Do you want to go see him?
I'll take you if you want to go.
That's thanks to all your help.
Oh no of course not.
Has that gone in?
How can I help?
Do you think I should?
I want to see it on you.
What about this one?
Yeah everything's under control.
I'd have to see it on.
What do you think of this one?
And the party?
Maybe it would work.
At dinner together?
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
I'll talk to her and to Dad too.
She'll come around.
Tell me more about the job.
Just remember that I love him.
I will Dear.
Michael just got a job.
Not even if it's something positive?
If you want me to pick you up I will.
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm only looking out for you.
Of course if that's what you still want.
I wanted to talk that over with you too.
You're looking good.
Paul said he'd call the school.
And my class.
We all agree with the doctor Dear.
Can we go home now?
But you know Paul.
He's sure to get it.
Are you sure Dear?
Will you get time off to do that?
I'll be running it three days a week and...
How wonderful darling.
What does that mean for you?
You've been so great.
I think that's right.
It's good to let it out.
Maybe that's where we should start.
Green and red.
Just eat whatever you want.
This will give you a chance to meet some people.
You should go.
And you make sure you take care of yourself.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
How about something better?
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Oh God Michael I know.
Why does everything have to be so hard?
Well then why'd it happen?
Someone has to take care of you right now Michael.
It's hard to know where to start.
I think I should call someone.
Silly silly silly.
Michael take it easy.
Silly am I?
Why'd you tell?
We both talked to her Michael.
And your dad.
It took me years.
How may I help you?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
It'll work out.
It's either work in the office or nothing.
That's Mr.
You've got one hell of a great body.
I'll see you tonight.
You're so wrong.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Let's try out the bed.
Let's see the rest.
You'll remember.
I better make a list.
And let's see what should you buy?
So it's over?
So there were no problems?
Tell me all.
What I should have said is ""It's a good thing I love you.
Your family just met me.
Then it's over.
Tell the doctor.
What else would you do?
That's where I always go when I get out.
Where would you go?
You must have thought about it.
That's no way for us to break up.
I wish I could have seen that.
I'm bad news.
Where've you been all day?
A small price.
The left one.
What have you done with the ring?
What are you looking to read?
I'm not the one who's who's...
You're just like the rest of us.
That must be really difficult.
Is this really important?
Chair cup and ball.
But it's over.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I heard about your friend.
I start on Monday.
Are you back at school?
You keep the ring.
Here's the ring.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I've met someone else.
I know this is a terrible thing.
Is it too much pressure?
I need to tell you something and I'm not sure how.
So will you?
I already told your mother.
So what do you say Let?
It's it's really nice Paul.
I've known for a while that this was coming.
So I've been thinking a lot...
Especially this last year.
This has been really difficult this whole thing.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Of course not no.
Something you did?
That's a big question.
You know what I think we need?
Of course it will.
It'll get done.
You can get out of the dinner.
No it's not like that.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
I mean tonight.
I knew you could do it.
In there's better.
Can I put these here for tonight?
She's only known the guy a few months.
It's not another one.
It's my sister.
It's a very nice letter.
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
I've worked really hard to get better.
Well I understand.
But really I've so many things to do.
How's it look?
I thought we had a deal?
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
I've been doing this for twenty years.
They're supposed to be evidence.
Listen we know their names.
You'll find them.
You'll never get out of the city.
So tell me where did they go?
Where did they go?
They left about a half hour ago.
Where are your friends?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
Should I call you back?
You're there now?
Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
You leave tomorrow.
Yeah -- you do that.
You told me that on the phone.
Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
I'm doing good.
We're doing everything we can to find these people.
They're the only ones I have of her.
What is happening with the world?
What did they take?
But you were there?
Your own brother?
He missed three weeks.
Stay and watch it with me.
You ever watch it?
Someone else coming?
You have something for me?
How about if I call you?
I just want to get my people home.
I only have your word for that.
And the other half?
And for my help I would get what?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
We've got a lot of people looking for us.
We'd just like to go home.
I've got to tell you Mr.
Not such a good friend.
a friend and--
Which one is it?
What kind of business?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Get that will you?
The six of us could find it in --
Forget the money!
We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
We just go home.
Being able to get away!
And be careful when you get near the top.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Hopefully no one.
That's an excellent plan.
Why should I have to put it on the list?
I bought everything you put on the list.
We still have to get out of here.
We all agreed to it.
You know I'd never go along with something like this.
The deal is whatever Mr.
Does it really matter what I say?
That would have left us with nothing.
Some bread and...
He's used to it.
Get out of the room!
You've got company coming up.
Has to be.
I mean do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
I would have to say...
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
The rest of us will come in through the front door.
I'm one and this is two three four and five.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
I'll tell you when it's time.
There's one more thing I need you to do.
-- Did you set it up?
I was just watching the news and--
You got money right?
I've got a way with people.
Man I can get anything.
Can you get them?
What do you want now?
do you think we'll find my car?
We're here about my car.
You think you can do that?
You're not good at it.
I just thought that--
Maybe you should call the police.
Can you believe that guy?
Just find them!
You said ""get them.
What'd they take?
Did you listen to me?
You wanted the money.
What do you think that makes me look like on the street?
What'd I tell you when you came to me for money?
Did I not say that?
What'd I say to him?
What room number?
Right now tell me what else you found?
And the other car?
The police are outside.
I was told to take what we have and go.
There has to be.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
And he gave it to us.
You can use my car.
We have to end this here.
We were supposed to be in and out.
In and out!
Yeah but you did do it.
So let's deal with that.
I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this.
He's coming after us so we might as well take the money.
Maybe if we did just leave --
You know a little of this a little of that.
We both know I'm already dead.
This is a car.
She took everything!
What the hell is he talking about?
but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
This is great.
God I want to go home.
No that's not Mr.
We have a problem.
It's my idea.
You lived there.
You know the city.
I thought you were somebody else.
If I knew it was you I would have never run.
They sort of got away.
How's my brother?
I'm telling you that's my car!
The hell it is.
Anybody know about that car outside?
You see that car?
I know where she went.
No problem man.
I say we make him pay first.
After that you can do whatever you want to him.
How do we know what room she's in?
Oh you think?
I think we went the wrong way.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
It's personal now.
He put it in yours.
How stupid is that?
It's a matter of what school you went too.
Me I never really --
Stick around and find out.
Who are you waiting for?
After last night I could say the same for you.
It's three in the morning.
Not much else to do.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
The lucky ones.
I went in for three years.
You got it in a bar?
That's how you get to know someone.
It looks old.
Did you get it a long time ago?
Did she break your heart?
They're not nice people.
He left it last time he was here.
No I like the bag.
It would be good for the job tonight.
When do we go?
Someone gave it to me.
What the hell is it doing here?
I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way.
I mean you are my brother and...
So I've decided to make it up to you.
I just wanted to say...
that I may have...
That's what a stand-up guy does.
This is on your head not mine.
I'll go and make up his room!
You've been gone so long.
You're back!
So you see this is personal.
Leave her to me.
Then leave her to me.
I'm a friend!
You need practice.
Like most things I am nothing.
All of it is simply a state of mind.
I do as I please.
I'm just playing around.
you've gone as far as you can go.
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.
Even your father.
How can I leave?
Where would I go?
Why are you still here?
You should leave!
You're home late...
or should I say early?
It will be just the same.
Go to bed then.
God knows what the future will bring.
She's one of those.
Put them down.
Do you want to change into them?
Give this to Mrs.
She'll help you.
It goes straight to the heart.
Take your pick.
Come and get it if you can.
You were never a real friend anyway.
You're no sister of mine!
You're working together to set me up!
Go back to them first.
I'll give them to you.
Yes from the West.
The less I think of it the better.
I'll write your name.
They tell you all about that in those books?
I've read all about people like you.
You're too young to understand.
But I have had much practice.
I will hold on as long as I can.
Let's end this here.
You must decide.
She would miss us.
I will make my mark on the world.
He knew his wish had come true.
If you believe it will happen.
It is trouble for me.
Let them look.
Your father's men are still looking for you.
I am a man.
I thought where did they all go?
It means a lot to me.
Well there used to be!
Your horse needs water.
Let's stop a moment.
it took me a while to get in here.
I was wrong to let you go.
Come back with me.
You'll be free there.
Give me some hope...
Why not this?
Go home and check in.
I want to be with you...
just like this.
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.
Wait there for news from me.
We'll keep our eyes open.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
That's not for her.
She's not one of us.
In any case it will all be over soon.
You did your job well.
But this girl...
I saw her last night.
Well we had talked...
Then why did you come?
No I'd already sent them home.
Were you involved?
Join me once you have finished.
It'll be just like old times.
So what will you do now?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
How can you part with it?
It has always been with you.
There was something...
Training is everything.
I left the training early.
And how are you?
It's been too long.
Now that's news!
Then someone's trying to set him up.
maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Please accept our thanks.
What in the hell...
do you call that?
Who ever made that.
This was somebody else.
Care for a hot dog?
Well hello there...
A year ago.
I'm too busy tonight.
The hell you say.
I have one more thing to do.
I mean I've done what I came to do.
But it will pass...
Hey man -- you're hit.
I should be trying to stop you.
A day of life plus change...
I'm sorry as hell man.
You were there; you saw her.
I saw you seeing her.
I mean what just happened.
You went out the window.
She died in the hospital.
I need you to tell me what you remember.
What happened to us?
You died man.
I saw it too.
You my friend are dead.
I saw your body.
Fucking A my friend.
And I say I'm dead...
and I move.
You left the door open.
He was a present.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
But you have this...
and you know where to come.
In a better place.
Now do you get to see her?
This way you'll think of her every time you see it...
I think he's yours now.
I remember him!
Is he still yours?
Do you feel okay.
You sure ask a lot of questions.
Does she have a name?
He has a room upstairs.
I'm waiting for her but she's probably with him right now.
She's still dead.
Well how's your friend?
I went to see a friend of mine.
What do you want him for?
you're dead man...
You cut her.
A man and a woman.
end of story.
It's yesterday!
Answer yes or no.
I never saw you.
Like the car.
I took yours from you.
You're mine.
And it turned out to be you.
I want the girl.
Of course you can.
I can see her.
How the hell did you do that?
I've already done that.
Your job is done.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
You work for the dead.
Forget that and you can forget it all.
What the hell are you?
I've got him if you want him.
We've got company.
But tonight I can take what is his.
Yes it is real.
the hell is that?
What's it supposed to mean?
Now tell how your friend died.
I know of no one.
I had heard something like this.
One of mine.
Who got himself what?
He sent it to me the day before he died.
Everything about you is in it.
It's all in there.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me.
I just came in here to get something of mine.
You might say that.
On my mother's life.
Now it's my job to look out for you.
Not a whole lot.
What else do you know about him?
I thought he said it all the time.
I've never known him to say those words before.
Well that's over now.
But you knew this was important to me.
The fact of the matter is there is some one I love.
I'm just being honest.
I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
I wish I felt the same.
It's not you it's me.
Well here it is.
I'll move on but you...
I think that's for the best.
Back to the city.
I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer.
That's not fair.
Then what's wrong?
You are very pretty.
I'm happy you're being honest with me.
""I actually feel good about myself?
I actually feel good about myself.
Can we do this again next week?
Maybe I'd like it.
I'm trying to change here.
Need any company?
What are you up to today?
I'll let you go.
It's not about being happy.
I'll leave this afternoon.
I want you to leave and go back to New York.
How can I win your heart.
That's also none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm seeing a friend.
Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Well try this one on for size.
And that's a bad thing?
I wish I could say the same for myself.
I was up thinking about you all night.
It was fine.
Oh right last night.
It's my house.
Friends it is.
I'm sorry but you're not my type.
look we're friends.
I'd like to take you out.
I'm not a happy person.
How's the water?
Is that the last thing you need?
Give me the fucking letter.
Another letter from your friend?
You need help.
I'm trying to read.
You talking to me?
Alright I said I was sorry.
Can we start over again?
Fine forget it.
It's not really important.
A friend wrote me.
How do you know I've been with several women?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs.
Alright I believe you.
Football team started practice last week.
I shit you not.
You know -  ""What are you doing man?
It would make sense.
Where did you say she's from?
Any ideas who it could be?
I want to be at Mrs.
Go to your room now.
Those are my letters!
Where did you find those?
What are the boys like?
That's one way of looking at it.
Now that you're on your way it would be stupid of you to stop.
Well did you like it?
If that's what you call it.
It happened at your house last night.
Does your mother know?
Something awful happened last night.
Of course I would.
We're friends right?
You'd do that for me?
Your mother must never know.
I do like him.
Well do you like him?
Do you want to learn or not?
How else do you think girls learn?
Here turn around and face me.
I hear he's very nice.
No you were fine.
I like it better when I'm on top.
For the first time yes.
Want to join me?
And then I can go home?
Please please please.
I think I should call her anyway.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I look terrible.
He'll love it.
You think he'll like it?
But I thought high school is only four years.
What year are you in?
How are things down under?
Would you please leave.
I see right through you.
It works a little.
Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here.
Same time next week?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Let me tell you something doctor.
We've been at this for six months.
Things just got out of hand from there.
Jesus Christ how can you be so stupid?
Is she with you?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
I'm pretty sure she did.
And you think she bought it?
You told her I never said I love you before?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
You're the only one who knows her.
What about your family?
Will you stay here for the night?
You can leave in the morning.
That's when my parents get back and --
I'd be careful if I were you.
God knows what he's up to.
He hit me, then took off.
Please come over.
He's out of his mind.
Tell her you love her.
War it is.
I think you have your answer.
I'm very sorry about that.
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her.
It's over you.
Now, where were we?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
If not for me then do it for you.
At first it was but now it's become something bigger.
You're in love with her.
It clearly is why.
So you made love.
ah forget it.
For her first time?
She left thirty minutes ago.
So what went wrong?
How'd it go with Mrs.
How'd it go last night?
If you must know yes.
Take a look for yourself.
Now are you in or are you out?
You do realize that.
I'm aware.
Well let me know when you do.
Any day now.
Moving along quite well.
I hate it too.
But who will they turn to for help?
You would not believe what--
You can put it anywhere.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet?
And if I win?
What are the terms?
I'll think about it...
What do you plan to do?
I've read it over and over again.
This baby's the real deal.
Jesus Christ is she for real?
It's too easy.
""But I thought high school was only four years.
"" I mean please.
She knows nothing.
She's seen nothing.
I see your point...
though why should I care?
So that's what this is all about.
Oh poor baby.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs.
Let me get that for you.
She's so young and he's so -
It's worse.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
It's really important.
Could you please see that she gets this.
Young man I already told you she's not here.
Do you know when she'll be back?
She's out.
Do you know where she is?
I've already told you she's not home.
I've heard such nice things about you.
no thank you...
I said do you want some water?
Yes you already did.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Did she show up?
You got to go.
Did you hit her?
Oh Christ she got to you too?
Can we do it later.
I've had a really bad night and -
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
How will I get to her?
Write her another letter.
You're a lucky guy.
If a up to you both of you.
Only you two can bring her into a real world..
I can see it all...
that started all this.
Yes  She's a little odd I understand.
I hope you'll come to see us.
That's exactly what I told Mr.
to a situation) Really Mr.
Oh thank you darling.
It was right there on top.
Where'd you get this darling?
Then you must keep it true.
But it's already come true.
I got my wish anyway.
Are they nice?
Do you know the people?
On the back street  a green house
Someone gave it to you?
Where was this old house?
Where did you get this ring?
Oh lots of times.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh you'll remember it some time.
What are saying darling?
You get your wish!
We've got to go on.
Let's not go on with this.
Well you know where it is.
I was somewhere else.
Well it seemed to me --
Did you hear the child out?
But they must have.
I think I should.
No kids yet.
Something's gone wrong.
Maybe I ought to call somebody.
It's nearly a quarter after four.
It's early yet.
I know dear.
But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.
And especially today  let's forget about it.
She's my child.
She said something about that Mrs.
But I told her to go with you.
Is that where she got the ring Mrs.
And you should.
I live right here.
Are you coming to see us.
She's upstairs..
But there's no one here darling.
Yes she was afraid.
I have eyes too and I tell you no one's there.
I want you to look once more.
Take as long as you want.
There's no one at all in the garden.
Where do you see her?
She's there just like I said she'd be.
Would she be there now?
Right out there in the garden she does!
Why did you call her your friend?
Why daddy you know my friend too!
She gave me a ring so I'm giving her a ring.
And this one's for Mrs.
Just you wait!
These are all from me.
Daddy it's true.
It was on account of the birthday party.
I wanted to talk to you  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
What do you want.
But this is different.
What'd you get for Christmas?
Death's like life.
Death's a part of life.
Oh it is it is!
Death's terrible.
But she's dead!
I know what it is now when people say somebody died.
I know what they mean!
And I'm afraid.
She's dead; she's dead!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together.
I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
I shall wear it in my hair!
It cost me more than all the others.
Oh how beautiful!
I brought you a present.
You be the friend who comes to see me.
I'll show you my children.
Round about the fire we go...
Oh yes they do.
But you must!
You'll always play with me?
you and I...
Not even Daddy...
For always then.
I shall want you for always.
For as long as you'll let me.
Will you be friend for always?
I can not tell you.
But where is that?
But where do you come from?
I've wanted a friend too.
I've wanted a friend.
I'm your friend.
But who are you?
You called me by my name.
But where has it gone?
It got hit.
Probably hit by a car.
But I saw what it was.
You get me to go with you when you want to come here.
But she's such a nice lady.
I do suppose so.
Soon as I finish.
Will you come soon?
You just wait until I finish here.
But I want to talk to you.
I've got to take back this ring.
Let me take another look at that ring.
It's a pretty ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Look at my ring.
A Christmas present.
It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
He'll let me stay Mrs.
He'll let me stay.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story.
How do you like your tea?
But I only came to give back the ring.
Indeed you may not.
I gave it to you as a present.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Good night mother good night.
If that child comes here...
That little girl who comes here...
You called me by name!
And my hair...
yes that's true.
And my eyes...
Look at me mother darling.
That was long ago.
We'd better be getting on.
The family will be waiting.
That's from her -- that woman.
You've got to come with me.
Let the child stay.
What could you be giving me.
So do I Mr.
I like to see her happy.
Go on -- out with you.
Everything all right down there at the school Mr.
But we have.
She's wanted for nothing.
In her mind her friend was in the garden.
But there was nothing no one in the garden.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
The other one was a dog.
Can we get some service here?
She needs more water.
What's with her?
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
I've been working out.
She's always hot.
It's always something.
I'm not myself during it.
It's been about three weeks?
It's not just in my head.
That's just part of being a woman.
How's the rest of your health?
No, it was another woman.
I mean where on your body?
It's okay if you are, we just want to know.
What does that have to do with me?
God I hope so.
Hey can I call you later?
Peter's still here.
Oh thank god.
Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Never been better.
Peter spent the night.
I must really love him.
Yes just check on me once a day for the next three days.
I wish I only had your problems.
It was sort of a test.
I think George knows.
But how do I know if I really love Peter?
If you love him he'll be fine.
I think I love him.
You'll get through this.
You were fine for over three weeks.
So what do I do?
What choice do we have?
Do you think we can believe all this?
Let's find her and talk to her.
Check out what I found.
It might never happen again.
You have to get on with your life.
The thing is I really like him.
Maybe you should go out with him.
Look go about your life.
Act like nothing's wrong.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
You're such a good friend.
Let's do some research.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
I think I just got my period.
He must really like you.
Peter knows something.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
Peter saw me now I have to let him in.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
I told George I was with you last night.
I should call the police.
Oh no Peter.
Peter is the police!
He's been here all night?
He must be still in there.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Get rid of him!
No way could you have done that.
I've called you for two days.
He's afraid of me.
That was not in my head!
maybe this is all in your head.
It's bloody and...
Yes they are!
Look how much more hair I have than you!
Oh my god look.
It is so hot in here.
I've never had that before.
I think he called you beautiful.
We can meet and go together.
It's just as well.
Mark seemed great at first too.
Then while he's out...
When did you see him?
Are those Mark's?
Why the hell did he do that?
So did you do it?
Of course trouble is you never know what they'll expect for it.
I never thought of it like that.
""Can I use your phone?
"" ""I want to meet your cat.
It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
I kind of asked him to.
We were you know...
he got a little carried away...
You should see a doctor.
It's not about him seeing you in it.
It's how you feel.
Okay just one more stop and you'll be all set.
Try to get through dinner without them.
You have beautiful eyes.
Only to see.
Do you really need these?
How about I give you a make-over?
You'll feel better about yourself.
I wonder what it's like being you.
I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good.
Anything's better than Mark.
You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about right?
Really I'm...
"" It took three of them to pull me back!
How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
I did something stupid.
I hear you talking.
I know you're in there.
Who's this Mr.
Oh my god I'm sorry!
You do though.
You look really...
You never say that.
You look different.
I mean you look good.
Since when do you care?
Not for us.
Yes that's what we're looking for.
The important thing is that it stop.
to do any of that.
I might have...
Worse than this?
We can work this out.
Maybe we should have children.
There's no getting rid of me.
Does that make you feel better?
No matter what form you take.
Peter I love you too but...
Just go away.
Go very far away!
Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes sort of.
I mean no not really.
Is there someone else?
Look I think I know what happened to Mark.
I want to help.
I'm coming over.
No it's a good thing.
Everything about you is great.
You know I've never seen your cat.
They're for my cat.
Like I had to say it?
No I wanted to say it.
Is that how you feel?
No it's just...
no one's ever said that.
Is it that funny?
She made us call her a different name.
I thought we were starting something...
No I got it.
Can I carry your box?
Yeah sort of.
Never seen anything like it.
I'll be down in a second.
We need to talk to you.
Maybe I should go.
I mean we can still...
Oh nothing's wrong.
What are they for?
Thanks for the walk.
Maybe we could...
He's bad news.
So why did you and...
Mark break up?
I'm so sorry Peter.
I've had time to get over it.
No she died when I was twelve.
Oh it's nothing.
So what book did you buy?
Maybe some other time.
They continue walking together.
That was stupid.
Okay if you think of anything else please give us a call.
he walked me home and...
When's the last time you saw him?
You use the word ""fucking.
No I have a cat.
and I felt sick...
What makes you think I was the last one?
No I said it was our first date.
Looks like it was your only date.
No it was our first date.
Did he come home with you?
we had dinner.
Oh my god what happened?
She's my best friend.
Maybe he got lucky.
She's just so...
It only works if you're on good terms.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
How the hell is that your business?
Jesus Christ she got her period.
Just this morning.
What makes her think that?
And you just happened to be there...
This makes no sense.
This one walk you home too?
He means the last that we know of.
And his eyes were open.
Come on she's not here.
And you think I'm sick?
Hell no I'm not into that shit.
No way a woman like that could have done it.
That night couple weeks ago.
No one available.
It's definitely him.
Says he is the man's doctor...
Maybe ten minutes...
Was that for real down there?
I met a friend of yours the other night doctor.
Everything's fine...
And how is his state of mind?
This case is very important to me.
How could you have been so stupid?
What makes you think that!
He might be able to...
Why do you want to speak to him?
The case is yours.
Take what you need.
These places are full of them.
All the important stuff.
Put it through...
Says he must talk to you.
Well be more careful please.
It seems fine.
All clear now sir.
I need to go back to the station.
Where do you think this goes?
The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
That's not all.
It was like a game.
Then I would turn the lights off.
Why are they after you?
I thought maybe you know something...
Why give yourself up?
A few days...
Worse thing is I never know if it will change back again...
How long has this been happening?
We have to get you to a doctor...
Get off this case.
Have a look.
What is that door?
Just let me sit here for a moment?
Then who is after you?
Then we must call the police.
Time is short.
You've been working too hard.
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...
But this one's special.
It will help you understand everything...
Not that again...
Is that it!
We've got so much to talk about...
I'm here to help.
Can I get my life back?
I'm nothing then.
Without a past we are nothing.
This is why you are so interesting.
You remember nothing eh?
The woman you told me about?
Known me for long?
You're supposed to be my doctor right?
Tell me about them...
That's what people keep telling me.
Your name is John White.
Over and over.
What does she say?
It's like there was never anything there.
You must try.
You know something about me?
You remember nothing?
Who you are?
What you've done?
They're dead John.
What about my parents?
Do you know where I can find them?
Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
I thought it would make more sense.
Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
Well maybe I am.
Do you understand me!
You're NOBODY...
You mean the press conference?
Well it's a last minute change.
) Listen you little...
I mean  if it's a problem...
Hands to the side...
I'm not certain about...
For a month.
Okay let's go over it again.
Now remember -- keep it simple.
How much do you usually get paid?
I mean  if you wanted me to talk or...
You understand what you'll be doing?
Just what you think I mean.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
He was only doing his job.
What I told him to?
He's only doing what you told him to.
He's not a President!
Do we have anything on the budget today?
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Couple of days.
When does it break?
Just make something up.
The whole thing is under control.
Check his kids.
What about the wife?
' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Oh -- the First Lady...
What about her.
Is that everybody?
Up and around?
I made him.
I built him.
Well -- take care.
You did great.
Let's start at the top.
Well there's lots of places where I think you can save but I'm not the one who's.......
Can we save anywhere?
Who does these books?
I am the government.
Why would they do that.
I'm serious Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
You want to get dinner later?
Dave -- I'm working.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Oh I know I know...
We had to Dave.
What do you mean you made it all up?
We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Let's call it a night.
But we went there.
We saw those kids.
Yeah but the First Lady...
It's just five minutes.
She comes in.
'  Hand on the heart...
Thanks I wrote it.
That's at a press conference.
At a press conference.
Now  let's say the whole country.
Was in that car.
Well  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.
I might have.
Will he be alright?
It's actually kind of serious Dave.
It's sort of an...
It's difficult for all of us.
Now Dave something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Do you want to tell him that?
Does it make the cars any better?
How'd you get started?
You ever think back to how you started.
Sometimes they do.
That's all I have.
Oh come on we're not children.
Something like what...
It's not that far.
You alright down here by yourself?
You mean with you and everything?
Well is that really true?
You ever use it?
That's your whole job?
So how long have they been like that - - you know him and the First Lady?
Your government needs your help.
I lived with a President.
So this is it?
I never thought I'd...
) Thought I needed a little change.
And if you do a little and I do a little...
then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
I mean I want to...
It was okay?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Is that funny?
You find people jobs?
You mean when I'm not running the country?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
There's got to be something open around here.
In fact  I'm not anything like him and...
I mean he's almost dead but he's right here...
I mean you're right here...
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I'm okay from here.
You sure this goes somewhere?
Where's home?
I'm sure they did.
They asked me to help.
When were you all planning to tell me?
A year from now?
I mean what is it?
'  Where is he?
Anybody would have done it.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Mind if I sit down?
I thought maybe you were up.
Oh come on Bill.
I'm not one of your little...
I'm talking to you!...
How could I what?
Did you take care of later on?
We're all set  sir.
We're doing our best sir.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.
We're working on it.
Did you get someone to double for me there out front?
I wish I had better news...
There are no others...
it's over...
Do others know?
Will others come?
look for a place...
a place to live in...
Then why did you come here?
There are no...
Only the walking dead.
They have won.
a dead place...
Two of us...
only two of us...
YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
We'll have a little talk first.
I can help you out.
Let's just....
Get a better look.
Let'em know we're here....
It's some kind of....
There must be something under the ground here....
Help me get him to the boat.
You'd hold us back.
We have to go on.
Oh I wish you could hear me.
I have looked bad for four years.
Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years.
you look real bad.
And when ya do...
There's no place like this place.
It's all mine now.
ha ha ha...
HA HA HA HA....
They came here...
went to hell...
All that's
I'm sorry General if I...
It's quite clear that...
How long do we have to watch him?
Looks like just two.
We can take 'em when the time comes.
We got some ground up already...
but we could never find enough.
I'm the one he wants.
If I turn myself in...
You'll get lost.
I can find it myself.
You think you can find your boat?
You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now?
Oh what did I run into?
I'm sure that's true miss.
The man I was with...
We know you came up against 'em.
I'm sorry for that.
well it could be the end of everything.
There were actually walking dead...
That's the man.
That's what we call the dead...
the walking dead...
Ha ha ha ha ha...
This stuff really works?
We know what's down there.
I say we got a boat.
Can you get other stuff?
We got a boat.
Can you get me into the hospital?
Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
I'm a friend.
I need help and so do you.
You saw them in there.
To say nothing of the...
We must wait.
I'll do it....
I'll do it myself....
when it needs to be done.
One day a dead man will...
I will live.
GET THE OTHERS.
Like all the others.
You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
you might say that Mr.
as some of the rest of us.
She'll be alright.
Not while I'm still using it!
No wonder they're so....
You've seen worse.
I can work here.
Maybe my work can help...
I am not...
I'm not strong that way.
At the door.
I said I'll take care of them.
Just leave them there.
No time for that.
I'll take care of them.
You act like they're your mother or something.
You afraid of them?
I'm in as long as we're careful.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful.
Did you read it to her?
The point is she was thinking about me!
I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.
What is the point?
That's not the point at all!
Must have Chris!
I have no idea what I am or what I want to do!
Hey this is great.
It'll help you get Chris.
I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
How was dinner?
Tell him off!
Right after dinner.
So much the better.
Nobody knows who we are.
Oh God it's over now!
Well of course not.
But I thought-
I'm thinking!
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.
You're not like that.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?
That's part of what this club is about.
If I find that there are others Mr.
It's only me Mr.
I want names.
It was just me.
Who else was involved in this?
Yes he is just a moment.
We were just talking about that.
Your family move into that new house Mr.
Doing fine sir.
How's your father?
It's better than doing nothing.
Maybe he'll have some advice.
Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Where'd you find them?
Where did you learn to play like that?
I'll second that.
Who's in?
I'm just saying
Hey I heard you went to summer school?
It's not all right.
Come on Dad
It's just for a little while.
Just give me one chance.
Then come with me.
To a play?
Look I've got to go.
And if it so happens that you're wrong?
If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Of course just like that.
That's how you always know when it's right.
Just like that?!
You just knew?
Of course I know you!
But I love you.
Well you did!
All I'm asking you to do is listen.
I love you Chris.
Please accept these.
Look for her.
Did you bring anybody?
Thank you Chris.
But you can bring someone if you like.
That's your sister school right?
That goes for all of you.
Now eat with your correct hands.
"" Anybody want to read?
You make him or someone like him up.
Very good Mr.
"" Anyone know what that means?
At these boys' age?
Not on your life!
Way before your time.
It was hard giving it up I'll tell you.
I have something.
Have him act.
I close my eyes.
Close your eyes and think of the picture.
Perhaps he was.
Good god boy!
You told your father what you told me?
What did your father say?
Let him see who you are.
That's two years!
What about the play?
I know what he'll say.
You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
You can only live for yourself.
Have you told your father what you just told me?
I mean I can see his point.
It's worth everything.
That's why I came back here.
What did the name mean.
Nothing wrong with research.
You have another choice.
You really think I should forget her?
They're friends of my dad.
What I have to do.
Yeah you just do everything they say!
God I want to do everything!
That is where they should be.
Then you can help him.
Is that clear!
Father I have the main part.
I've got all As and-
Who put this in your head?
How did you expect to get away with it?
Call us if you need anything.
You know me always taking on too much.
Until then you will listen to me.
But father it's not fair.
That's miles.
I say we go tonight.
""  See you at dinner.
Put more into it!
Lots of girls.
I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world.
God I love this!
His birthday's always a big to-do.
Well maybe they thought you'd need another one.
Maybe they thought...
You get anything?
That's what I'm taking care of.
I can take care of myself just fine.
People follow you.
I'm not like that.
No I want you in.
Not just say you're in.
You want me out...
is that what you're saying?
None of what Mr.
By the way there's a meeting this afternoon.
But if he said no before then...
Maybe he'll say yes.
Hell no but that's not the point.
And now he will?
Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.
What's it got to do with you?
What I want to do!
What is it then?
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
know what I mean?
I'll take him over mine.
So what do you think of my father?
My brother went here.
How do we get out of here?
all I know is...
I'm talking about us...
We're the fish.
Boat or no boat...
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
Maybe we lost them.
Just trying to get to my boat...
Did you clear this?
Shut up all of you!
Now here's what we're doing...
Where are my men?
You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Great woman your mother.
How soon can we get up and running?
I know it...
but you want to get where you want to get and back?
Who asked any?
And no questions asked.
Out and back.
I've got a contract.
The one you came up to ask...
Which question is that?
and the answer to your question is yes.
You know what they say...
I think you were just starting out...
what did we use to call them?
He's not coming...
Where's you friend?
I'm not back...
no matter what...
And what if I run into one of those things?
You want ME to go up there?
there's one left up there.
once this baby's set...
How do we do it?
How do we get there?
A million little things like this...
It's not them...
it's it...
You should talk...
You're saying they can think?
Takes one to know one.
The ""come back"" kind.
What kind is that?
You have a boat.
Yeah you did...
On the side!!
So this boat of yours...
that's what you do?
Thank you I work at it...
Look lady I know you people are used to getting your way...

What are those things?
Jesus Christ lady...

He's with them.
What are you people talking about?
Who asked you to!
Now look what you did!
Shut up man just shut the hell up!
You hear me!!

and for what?
She's gone...
And what have you come up with?
I have been.
I'm telling you man we got to give the future some serious thought.
Line it up now nice and easy...
A little to the left...
there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...
is that what it is?
Just the man I wanted to see.

maybe a couple of kids...
some sort of business...
What did you do the my kids!!
That's all you give a shit about?
Sure I do...
I was here...
you know that?
Here's what I think...
If I told you once...
I told you a thousand times...
You want some too?
I'm looking...
What is it man?
I hate the cold water.
Check it out!
Come out here!
Someone's back there.
There's you him and me!!

What's there to think about??
That THING back there...
What are you trying to pull!

You want 'em?
Those are mine!
Fucking women man...
That's what I'm telling you!
What's this for?
She does not!
I mean what do you know?
Let's go!!!
Oh boy yeah...
Even in Europe!
I mean what do you think?
I mean take it easy.
They did too!
They did not!
I'm telling you they changed it!
Who's full of shit?
This is it but they changed it.
It is too!
It is not!
I'll get it!
Jesus you think we'd miss this?
Well where the hell is he!!!
I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Worse since she talked to who?
He's serious.
I love this car.
Some cars sit you know?
This car a car like this...
I mean you never know with a car like this where this car has been.
Couple of weeks...
Hit it here.
Where should I hit it?
Just show me where I should hit it.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
What hospital is he in?
Twice a day.
Where is he???
You are his friend.
Just so you know.
None of that.
But of course!
Do you mind if I sit?
But you must come in.
I show you.
That's exactly what I mean!
She's in back.
Now he's back.
That's who we're looking for.
You ever try 'em?
Where's it gone?
Twenty maybe thirty feet.
Take last night...!
And look what he does!
What do you mean Oh well?!
The guy is actually...
He did it again!
That's what he's doing...
Look at that see...
Wait a minute watch.
You know what that guy is doing?
Worse since she talked to him.
How's she taking it?
Hey I'm fine.
Boy oh boy!
That I must not tell you.
You see there.
I'll be out...
Just leave me.
I'll be out.
I've got the car.
There must be something.
I think you should...
Like we did.
Like we always used to.
I mean how does this job work out?
This guy wants his money.
I mean now.
Or maybe you do.
Let's have this.
Maybe we should have coffee.
Is that what it is?
You have to take that off.
That was nothing.
I just go along you know.
Down at the market.
I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!...
Are you sure you're all right?
Oh I missed you so!
and I was thinking --
I'd want to pay you...
And then you...
A great deal of money.
But I am always...
how do you say...
looking out for those who do...
Where did you play?
You do this for money?
This is horrible!
You have to think about this.
You have to do it.
Who the hell knows!
She's fine...
I thought you went home.
You got me?
The game goes on until I move.
No fucking way!
It's the only chance we've got!
Against each other?...
GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
Okay you're right...
Okay you're right.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I'm doing that too.
They could be up there right now!
What are you God?
I mean so he knows...
You think we'll ever come back?
Well where's he from?
Is he from here?
Who's a yo-yo...?
Who do you think's a yo-yo!
They're all yo yo's.
Who's a yo-yo?
Being out maybe.
I think about it all.
I want to be ready...
You have to be ready...
It has to be there in your mind.
You think about it?
I just wait.
It's what I wait for...
I wait all year.
You should have put that on last night.
""This is this""?
What does that mean ""this is this""?
This is this!
You come out here...
That's what you always think but this time you're wrong.
This time you're on your own!
What do you mean no???
You want to hear the whole story?
Hey it's okay!
Just a week.
You said you'd be --
I saw him last night.
I thought I was out of my mind.
Did you get one?
You're the heart.
How can you need me?
Place is great.
One great place...
When are you getting out?
How's it with you?
How's things?
That's my plan.
At the top.
Just forget that.
Forget what it says in the book.
would like to say a few words...
that he could find.
I saw you!
What the hell was that!
Just like always!
Just like it always was!
Six or eight.
you have to understand doing it with one...
How's it feel to be back?
What's it for??
What the hell's that for?
That's really great!
That's who.
Same old thing.
Hey same like always.
Hey it's all right.
We'll be right here right with you.
Up a little there...
Down I would say...
Up I would say...
We've got trouble.
Not their sector.
I'd think about it.
Michael called yesterday.
He was behind it all.
I worked for him...
I want to know who put you up to it.
I want to ask you a few questions.
What better way to keep me from talking.
and I was on to you.
so you shut me up.
I heard about today.
I'm about to go on.
You'll only get older.
This is what you wanted!
Just got the call.
Took him from school.
You look like day old shit.
You against him.
The City's just in the way.
We'll work things out when the time is right.
I'll be alright.
Out of the room.
How do you stop it?
In that time he'll be an old man.
Could be a year an hour or all at once.
He's not that old yet.
I remember what he looks like.
Fill it out.
A good job.
A chance to get back with your family.
I just called it as I saw it.
You were brought here for a reason.
I was set up and you know it...
You look like shit.
You want evidence.
I'll give you evidence.
You have no evidence.
Please come out with your hands in the air.
He could be brought back.
Keep 'em busy.
You've got a family.
I'm giving you a chance to see them.
All these years.
Go in the house.
Nobody's looking.
I can help you.
And you should be with your family.
You should be in hospital.
You be careful.
If you were set up I want to find out who did it.
Mother of Jesus.
He never did time.
This should make your day.
What are you talking about...?
What else did he get?
You're just afraid to use this.
That's what you got.
I'm just doing it by the book.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
This case is important to me.
Then I'll understand.
Never use it.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
You need anything else?
Thought maybe he'd come back.
What's this place?
Plan on doing it this summer.
Who would want to do that to you?
I was set up.
What language are you talking?
Think like him.
That's when we'll get him.
What's it like to be dead?
Then what goes on in there?
What I mean is what are you thinking about?
Well I'm sure.
We'll have to wait until they move.
It's about to go down.
Some things never change.
twenty years is a long time.
Does it drive itself too?
Well that's good enough for me.
They always are.
You never want to find out.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.
I'm not looking for company.
You could always take it off.
Would you like to buy me a drink?
What are those people doing there?
No -- that's for me to do.
I know -- and you could show me the door.
You know that you're in my house.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
No thank you -- what's your name?
I know -- it's that music.
Is there anything else you want?
You're wrong Mr.
Anybody can see that.
They are good old friends of mine.
Well I thought he'd come in the middle.
Young man -- you got me there.
I want to be here for the party.
I saw it from the window.
I see you!
That's just too bad --
But I like the new one better.
You just leave it all to me.
about the interest...
Well -- here's how it is...
What you think about it?
I'll look out for myself!
We'll drive round again week or so.
But she is -- I've taken her place.
Out with it -- you know something about me!
I do -- and I think you should too.
Well -- what about it?
What of that?
What do you think happens?
You are afraid!
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
No -- no he's not seven yet I am sure --
How old is he now?
Where's everybody?
Yes I wanted to get here before the others....
you're early today.
Well -- that's too bad....
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
That's the trouble with me.
Well now Mr.
Ah then you'll come with me indeed.
Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
I'm always open to reason.
-- Let me make up -- let me make up.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I'm through with you.
Trying to break our contract again Mr.
Oh I see what you mean.
In your case --
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
But let's look at the contract.
Can I be of any service?
Yes I might do that.
Look here now--
Not for seven years.
Well I'll be --
Well why should that worry you.
You will have money and all that money can buy.
And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.
It's mine?
All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.
You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do.
You make them work for you.
If I say I called you I did.
Oh come man come.
There's nothing like it.
Not long -- now.
how long have we to wait?
Mind you it's not the money I've been talking about it's what you make of it.
What -- what's on your mind?
This is a great day for me.
Come on in sir.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
You want me to go around --
You keep that -- that's for you.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you.
Why of course --
Oh yes -- yes.
But -- I was just lucky.
Did you hear Mr.
What's the matter with 'em?
That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
He's my son and I like him the way he is.
Why do you always have to pick on him?
If it's not the boy it's me.
He can be such a fine boy if we show him how to be.
Where are you taking him?
Well -- I -- I-
Now I've made up my mind.
You'll never change -- will you?
There is nothing to worry about now.
It's been a long day.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Everything'll be all right then...
We just got to do it.
Not all of it?
That's wonderful language.
That's what we said.
We said it's for better or worse.
Is there anything wrong with me?
Of course it's all right son.
And as for you -- let me tell you young woman...!
Got better music to listen to than that.
There -- that's what I mean.
You'll be a father any minute now.
We'll do better than that!
Now that's the way to talk Son!
But we'll make out.
What's that you say Son?
A man can always change things Son.
You see son?
I'm old and I've lived.
Why that's just sense Son.
Makes all the difference.
Do you really think that?
Me -- a son.
Oh go along with you!
Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
But it's true.
I mean it I tell you.
Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
And why should I?
He's better off than I am!
I wish I could tell Him...
up there just what I think.
You know that son.
Come on we'll have another talk with him.
The law is the law.
Let him try it.
Wish I could really do something for you.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well you just stop it!
please come with us.
She'll do nothing of the kind!
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Let her be son.
She'll do all right.
As long as people do that -- the country's all right.
But if you ever come down there I'll show them to you.
She'll be here in a moment.
Oh could you Mr.
Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door and we used to be poor ourselves.
That's not like him Mr.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words Mr.
No really thank you.
Hang onto him.
Why that's different!
I've got to see a friend.
I'll drink to that Mr.
The quick or the dead!
You have said it.
May -- the best man win Mr.
And who with better right?
But you shall not have this man!
Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Cup for cup!
Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Why certainly -- but be careful Mr.
May I -- join you?
Might I ask your name?
Say that's pretty good young man.
I'll be there too!
Oh -- it's you again.
It's only a short drive Mr.
I want to talk to men...
You can talk to me...
I want someone to talk to...
Come over to the door.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
That is Christmas music.
But meant her moving here.
Hey I'm sorry.
The past six months.
The girl was off today.
So your lady live out here?
Hey nice bag.
We must shut down the building.
or your husband.
Tell that to Mr.
Without him they might let us go...
How about his job?
what does he think he's doing?
something's gone wrong.
John how can you say that after all these years--?
This is radio not television...
The police are here now.
It's their problem.
John they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you.
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?
I can give him to you.
Hey business is business.
They want something.
I want dead --
* for this man.
He was my only brother...
my only family!
You'll never get it open!
I know about them.
This is what this is about?
Put it down now.
Sounds better than nothing.
Call me Bill.
and if you're not one of them...
you're an American?
I might get to someone you do care about.
Do you really think you have a chance against us Mr.
Unless you want to open the front door...?
Bad for your health anyway.
They may not do it.
When you're hot you're hot.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
* you were talking about.
Three down four to go --
We may have some problems.
If out plan works...
that's out of my hands.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
They're looking to me.
So that's what it was.
I'll be a few minutes.
I needed that John.
Oh here it comes.
Especially my name.
You must miss it every time you write a check.
I would too.
You'll be in the car the whole time...
Look let's make this easy.
I think it's me.
I remember our first date.
You wife's made for this business.
You throw quite a party.
something to do with this company.
Hey this is my wife...
But that's up to the guy upstairs.
what were you doing?
But you can tell her yourself.
I'd like you to do something for me.
Look up my wife...
and tell her...
She's heard me say I love you a thousand times but she never got to hear this...
You get all that?
I still feel like shit.
Eleven years ago.
he was big for his age...
They way you drive I can see why.
You still with us?
Not yet the wife in working on our first.
What do they put in these things?
Hey I love you.
So hang in there man.
Is the building on fire?
If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen when to shut up...
Did something --  -- Oh God.
You're coming in!
Let's talk later okay?
I hear you...
He did everything he could to save him...
if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
-- all we know?
are you out of your mind?
Things he said.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
I am Sir...
You'll be okay.
I saw you man!
Come on what's under this?
Jesus you're the man!
They're not after you they're after me.
Did I do something to make you do that?
Did I ever turn you down or anything?
What about the kids?
We need the car.
Well how'll I get home?
Oh yeah I will...
Well stay away from them.
maybe you better talk to one of these others okay?
Look we're kind of....

Are they on the phone still?

You on the phone?
Will somebody talk to me?
But what choice do I have?

They're standing all around me.

You talk to me with them on the phone right?

Then what do you want me to say?
How did they think that?
What are they...
What do you mean.

Would you do something for me?

One of the ways is not giving up.
I'm telling ya!

they walk around there...
I'm free to do what I want?
I'm getting out of here man.
But if I can get out of this...
you can come.
You're free to do what you want.
I did it on my own.
I did this all on my own.
Nothing on anybody.
Maybe it'll just end!
That would be all right too!
That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you...
or if you wanted...
You said to me that you needed money and I knew that you needed money!
and I said...
shit man I got to get this guy some money.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.

I mean what am I supposed to say?
I have been living with death for the last six months.
Why do you think I'm in the hospital?
And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone...
I have no friends left.
I have to live with people.
This death business...

Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?
Do you know...
Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?

So how are you?

You really feel...
I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
It was terrible.

But do you mean in?
But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
When it comes the time then we'll work it out.
But do you mean it?
How'd that happen?
Anybody else have to go?

Which one goes?
You give us one more now.
That's the deal...
You follow my car.

Everything I got is yours.

You want to be paid for...
How much you make a week?

I've been training since I was twelve.
You name it...
And another thing.
Not you not tonight.
He does this when he's around girls.
Nineteen years old.
Who's the girl?
<i>What is it?
I'm sorry it turned out like this...
They might be dead already.
<i>What happened to them?
<i>Did you get all four?
or worse yet...
Tell us everything you know.
I want to see them.
If there were...
<i>Her car was in the shop.
We know everything.
and it's not working.
I said I'd tell you everything I know.
I think you know exactly where the money is.
I'm here to ask you a few questions.
<i>Either this was some kind of set up...
I'M HERE!
<i>That's my best friend.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.
God help us.

It's just a word.
Must you use that awful word?
Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.

Life could be so easy...
Then so be it.
Then we go home.
No questions asked.

Can you tell?
No last names.
The less you know about me the better okay?
Do you have a last name...
You can save that Pretty Woman shit.
He died when I was a little girl.
I can certainly think of one more!
<i>twelve years?
JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
I have no idea what you just said.
Just shut up and do what they say.
Twice a night sometimes.
Now I've got ten million in the bank.

I know this.
Listen to what I said.
You think you know it all?
I'm your father you better remember that.
Then we could try something else.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
He's making us lose business.
Can you do better?
This is a place of business.
Yeah I think.
Oh my god are you alright?
Actually we have something for you.
So go away.
Give me the two fifty and go away.
You're it.
I have five kids at home I know how it works.
I'm just not ""it"".
No I'm not it.
I'll tell you why!
She's saying...
Then I'm in.
Baby listen there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Of course she's in on it too.
Hey look it's our teacher.
changed for dinner.
Boy it's hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?
Just down the hall.
Well I'll tell you what I think.
Sit down I have something to tell you.
Hard for me?
You had questions?
Okay there's a lot for us to go over so it may get hard for you.
Yeah but I'm buying.
Come over around seven.
We're all special.
Maybe I'll join you.
Yes you and the whole Special Needs class.
You're new here right?
Well save room for Mrs.
No I'm fine thanks.
Let's eat!
Dinner's ready.
So boys how was your first day?
Okay boys eat up.
Here's your lunch.
I'm just not ready.
So maybe it's time to make some new friends some friends your own age...
You take her.
Try one in a million!
She's one of a kind.
That's the one I wanted.
The one on the left.
Which one do you want?
First we have to decide who gets who remember?
Yeah we should never let a woman come between us again.
Well that's too bad this is his day.
How could she miss this?
Do you know what this means?
I mean I found it.
Well I'm listening now.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Sorry no further questions.
You certainly did.
Yeah that's why I asked.
Me me me!
No one knows?
He does look like a you-know-what.
Hey there's no reason to use that kind of language!
I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
So have you given him ""some"" yet?
Hey where did you come from?
Say what I say.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
You must know someone I can talk to.
You and me?
you and I could...
How do you know it's for us?
Our own special bus.
that makes much more sense.
Can he do that?
Anyone else have any questions?
Did I have your brother?
That would be me sir.
Where did you learn that word?
You take that back!
You're not my real dad.
I will stop this car right now.
And when I'm your dad you'll have to do as I say.
Three two one.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
It's a half-boy half-horse.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Out with the old in with the new.
Oh is this your special place?
You know you're the first person I've brought here.
God she's beautiful.
Yeah it's nice.
Which I am and you want to be.
I do know something.
I think it's just over there.
I go to school where I live.
That's stupid!
Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
I thought I told you to get lost.
You mean the lunch room?
You're the lunch lady.
So can I come along?
I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
That's not your tape.
Well what have we here?
Not to expect you tonight.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Oh I think you do.
A good question gets right to the point.
What are they doing in Special Needs?
You had some questions.
Special Needs class.
You're coming too.
I know where that is.
Looks like the best man won.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
So no small talk?
Oh go on.
So when can we do it?
In fact I want to ask you something.
You know ""some"".
This school's never had one before.
I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
You're in!
Oh my God it's really you.
I'm in your class at school.
You can bring whatever you want little friend.
There is none.
Maybe we can help.
But a deal's a deal my friend.
In you go.
It's too close to call.
Oh yeah give it to me.
You know I do!
Have you got what I want?
Hey can be on top?
Hey you two.
Where's Mr.
I reckon so.
My boy's special well how about that.
I knew you were different.
We're ""special"".
My little boy.
I think you did it.
Too big to make the turn!
You bet I left him took the dog and we was history.
That's great now make a left then straight!
turn down here!
of short bus.
I am strong!
Yeah I get it.
I've been through this a hundred times.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
no it's not horse you see I sold the horse.
This is horse?
Just let me do the thinking.
The evidence of what?
Just like the President.
Oh just like the President.
Just for the record.
I tape everything that goes on in this office.
So what do you keep in there?
And you are great in bed.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
We start our own class?
But I like the way you're thinking.
Just have a look at this.
This one is big time.
You've done it all.
I must have his ring.
He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
What's that you're saying?
Paul can SEE...
I hope they fit well my lord.
This is my son Paul.
Yes my Lord.
He is here my lord.
You must be outside this room....
Do what you can.
I must sit close to him.
ONE SMALL POINT...
LISTEN TO ME!!
the water of life.
Can you hear me?...
I see you behind it.
I see many things...
I hope I made myself clear.
Let me please my Lord.
Let him stand free!
Let him stand free.
They said you were dead.
but look down.
Not sorry enough.
we had practice -- this morning.....
Death may be the result....
They want me to take the Water of Life...
I will try to pass within.
I will take the boy-man...
That was close...
It could only be one thing....
Do you know this my lady?
And that day has come.
How little you understand.
Stop him yourself.
What's happened?...
Why did it leave?
if we're to have a tomorrow...
It's further than I thought...
I am so much more...
It's in everything here.
I can see it...
I can see it.
Listen to me!...
do you know why?...
I feel for no one...
Where are we do you think?
Oh great mother!
What about my Father?
He's strong...
Why do they come?
He shall know your ways as if born to them.
seemed the proper way.
Who told you how to do that?
The Water of Life.
Only a few of us know them all.
When we have enough...
Here I stand.
I will never be yours.
They tried and died.
Many men have tried.
What can be done has been done.
I've heard enough of my safety...
What about my father?...
You speak as if he was dead.
They tried and died....
I have heard of it.
It is said a man will come...
Many men have tried...
Do you know of the Water of Life?...
The person who can be many places at once...
Not all of them...
I know which ones will.
I only want to know one thing....
Do they come true?
but will he be ours to control?
My father sent you to test me.
Perhaps he would at that.
I'd know the difference.
It is my home.
I know it by heart...
These last few days have been a good time.
Let's do a take.
No you look good.
The doctor says you're all better.
You can come home.
There is no such thing as bad press.
A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!
It'll be wonderful.
I have nothing to live for.
And you should come with me.
That's all I've got.
Jesus Christ what an evening.
She changed her mind.
Why are you here??
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I wrote something special for you.
Let's put it on film.
How do we turn this thing on?
This'll look a lot better.
We'll film around you for a while.
the next film the next film...
that would be the one.
But maybe not.
But was it a bad decision?
Just keep looking forward.
I've been coming here for twenty years.
""Dear you're lovely.
Just say ""Dear you're lovely.
I'm an old man.
It's too long.
You'll be sitting on the right.
So how'd we do?
""It is my home.
Is there anything I can get you?
This happens all the time...
Should I call a doctor?
Let me take you to the hospital.
but you're a doctor!
You play the father.
Who do I play?
Eh forget it.
What else is big?
Do I have to get on one?
I am ready now!
Oh yeah of course.
I am always on time.
It's so great to see you!
Right on time!
hey that's pretty good!
Are you sure this is okay?
Do you want me to get it for you?
Perhaps we could get together again?
Back in the old days yes.
A great man like you...
I have no next picture.
When is your next picture coming out?
Oh there's my bus.
He's so big!
I've never seen anything like him!
It's real!
LET'S MOVE ON!
You want these people to think we have class.
I told him he was great.
It's just the beginning.
This is the big moment...!
It's that easy?
I know all.
And who may you be?
but I'll give you everything I've got.
We thought Mr.
Will he be okay?
I'm with Mr.
Now that it's done so am I.
But you used to say --
Did you really mean those things you said..?
I need a normal life.
That's the main thing.
The mark of quality.
How much money did he put up?
Of course I'm here.
Does she have room for me?
Look how many times can I say I'm sorry?
But there's plenty of other parts.
I wanted you to say ""No!
What did you want me to say?
Maybe you just need a day job.
That's the problem!
He wants his money.
The things I find interesting...
I'm no good.
It's so much money...
How can you just walk around like that in front of all these people?
And that's why you should play the part.
It's obviously ME!
This is my way of telling you --
And you never told me?
How long have you been doing this?
Well I'd really like to know what you think.
I'll Wait...
I'll read it as soon as I get home.
And he's really nice.
Oh the hell with you.
Better than not getting a job?
You got the job?!!
I had to say something to get in the door.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
What other sixty-thousand?
Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
What are you looking at me like that for?
I already gave you my three hundred.
I'd sure like to play her.
Oh of course!!
Oh my this is very interesting.
do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
That's all??
Perhaps a small amount of money.
I understand you just moved here?
That's not true --
No he's not!
""The Black Cat""!
Sure thing Mr.
I'll tell you what Mr.
Maybe we can do business together.
""  I get it.
So what's up next?
Hey what do you know.
What'd you give him all the lines for??
It's plenty!
Would that work?
Okay -- you know what you do?
Our church has the money for one film.
You could say that --
Could you please open up?
I'd be happy too if I had such a great family.
They did it all with their face.
And she no like.
Hopefully very soon.
Oh of course!
It is when it works.
You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?
So what are you working on now?
and I just wanted to meet you.
Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
I did all those things!
And one more thing.
So did you like it?
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
It's about this guy.
Should he tell her?
Should he not tell her?
No he's not dead!
I met him recently and he wants to be in our picture.
Fine maybe you're right.
It would be something better!
No no not at all!
but I really want this job.
And I'm good.
Yeah well a couple of things have changed.
It's only a five-hour drive.
You should feel lucky.
I should give her a call.
The poor girl's out of a job.
What would that be made of?
Well you tried --
I might as well be.
It's actually the only thing I know how to make.
it's just something I do.
But I think it's important that you know.
I like to wear women's clothes.
Your friend's.
I'm from back east.
You know All-American small town...
They're very nice.
I just picked them up on the way over...
How's your friend?
Oh it's you again.
How long's he been here?
He gets cold in this hospital.
What are you making?
I'm really sorry...
It's the same film.
So forget it!
It'll only take a minute.
Well I got nothing to do with that.
This time we go for the quality.
Bring 'em in!
This is looking good!
For making us into something.
Well it looks good.
Let's use it!
It looks too...
And what's that thing over there?
But only if you SHUT UP and let me do it my way!
I'm your husband!
Two people do.
Nobody does all that.
It's very expensive.
I like girls.
You mean like a date?
You came to my party.
Always good-looking.
Hell he's been dead for two days he still looks better than me.
I'm moving out.
Is there anything I can --
It's your father.
You thought it was me?
How's your mother?
Well now I will.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
What do you love her or something?
She's in the kitchen.
You had a busy night last night.
At what point?
And it's not an age thing --
There's this million-page contract --
Do they show it?
Unless I get up.
Then they go back on the air.
Ooh the sister!
She is hot.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
You know what would be great?
They know what they're doing.
Everything you wanted me to do I wanted to do.
Well I'm not starting now.
You never gave a shit about me.
You know everything you asked me to do I did.
Give it some space.
Can I tell you something -- as a friend?
Leave her be.
Yeah that's why I called.
You'd better be good.
I want you to take this.
Okay so you understand?
Where were you then?
I've got this great idea.
We put together a video.
Remember this was your baby.
I'm giving him another month!
He's out of the hospital already.
Take him off the air.
He's who we want to go with.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Between you and me it's not a bad way to go.
Making love to your wife...
I'd hate to think he...
She's coming right back out.
Can I see her?
Yeah a thing.
Oh right right!
Like ten years ago.
You did good.
Hey if it's free it's me.
Oh that thing.
Did you hear about this?
Your brother's here.
I'm doing all right.
You know who we are?
come on say good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Somebody called me.
What are you doing in a place like this?
What the hell did you do to him?
Do you think it's been easy for me?
It's been years.
He was my husband once.
In front of him?
I felt so sorry for him --
He called me up.
I'm coming right over.
It was his heart.
What's the matter?!
I'm at the hospital.
I mean about...
Should I just...
have nothing to do with him?
And what did he come back now for?
He had a woman in my own bed!
This is your father.
This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
He can be very...
I was six.
So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed.
I mean that worked out.
Well who knows?
tell him to call me okay?
And that girl has a name.
Maybe he's watching.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
it's -- just come out here.
Where'd they send her?
Now I've got to move.
Well when will she be back?
What is she at work?
That's - where is she is she all right?
Let them decide.
What kind of show will that be?
You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to.
It's not fair to us.
They're interested in you.
not really possible.
You said you wanted nothing to do with this.
Oh -- okay now I get it.
Never would be plenty.
How much less?
He's just...
trying a little too hard --
Are you asking me?
It's called ""Get your shit together before it's too late.
I mean you know let's face it -- you come and go here as you please.
you're not getting the job.
What's the deal?
Did anybody make a decision -
So act now.
But anyone can join in.
Well yeah everybody's someone.
But I mean someone they want to be.
Everybody's someone.
You see how people look at me.
you know like I'm someone.
Oh that was...
I mean all my life she's telling me one story and then...
Not in my house.
I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself...
There's a list.
Why are you so mean to her?
"" Who the hell am I?
Well just the seventy-one percent.
""  They hate me!
Page three of the Post.
I think we should stop seeing each other.
yeah then but...
I really like you too...
I know I...
What do they think -- we're not kids --
they went away.
you know do it they go away until...
we're done.
Saturday I think we should
That's lucky.
thinking about you.
But you know what could I do?
Look not having been there...
I mean bad.
I'm just Look -- you know in a way it's good.
Look I know this is...
two words then...
You do though you look great.
I saw this show once.
I was home sick there was nothing else on.
Why do it?
There should be like a line behind you.
I take a chance.
That's you!
I got paid by the word!
Let's remember how I got into this.
So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Good-bye brother!
Oh man I've been trying to call you.
You brought the girl!
Go over there and talk to her
I'm a guy.
The woman's supposed to stop.
Next thing you know!
You were so great...
"" Next thing I know we're...
We'd better go...
We knew from when he was five.
Show your face you look great.
Remember the last guy she got involved with?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
That's how they met.
You'll love this.
That's our sister.
See they should've picked him.
You know-- we're not the same.
I come and go when I please --
are you happy like this?
In a hot second.
Let me ask you something --
You would do this?
You would actually --
They had to pick you!
I mean it's all day!
Way to go!
I'm making a tape.
You're in show business?
Yeah but let's stay on one subject.
They'll be able to get whatever they want.
Being that guy.
Being the guy they watch.
You know that would be like a great thing.
No -- keep it.
You want a picture?
I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you still have it?
-- That we were doing together.
"" I finished it.
It came out great!
Sorry is good.
How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened it would've changed everything.
The whole time?
I mean how does anyone...
Am I supposed to?
do you own a cat?
Can I help with anything?
Are you busy tomorrow night?
We have to stop meeting like this.
Oh yeah I love those.
those are funny...
I really like your show.
I think you're great.
What does that have to do with...
That's the point -- this could change things.
Then we have...
I know what --
That was just talk!
I would never.
I mean we both used to talk about her
Dave I'm just saying this as your friend.
What you're doing is really really wrong and you've got to stop.
It's all in my head; it's right here.
I just got to get it out there.
Yeah it's serious.
But now it's different.
You did it at your house?
Your own house?
Here get down.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me the me that nobody else knows.
I mean you're the real thing.
What kind of person?
What kind of person am I?
I know its not by choice.
I just mean well being the kind of person you are it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
I'm just really busy.
But she can be a little much sometimes.
I mean you know.
Fill me up.
Come on fill me up
Just you know school.
Well sure nice to meet you.
He just think it would be best --
Usually it's more.
I think we've got a problem.
Just tell me who won.
If they've changed in any way --
I'm not supposed to tell.
I'll be back
Start with president and I'll be right back.
Well I thought that...
I hope so
Take as much room as you want
Oh is this...?
I just have to get something.
I want you to do something for me.
that's very nice of you.
And then things would be different.
Coming to see me.
Are you trying to.
Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Good for you
Where 'd you get into?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Well you came to the right place
I'm looking at new cars.
Looks like today's your lucky day
It could have been anybody.
I just know they were there when I left.
Did I do that too?
I've never heard of him!
As far as I know they--
You should stop her.
Should be easy.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
NO that's fine
Looks good to me.
You can put those in my box.
I'll look at them tomorrow.
One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Oh yeah you bet.
But we'll get to the bottom of it.
Even tried you at home.
We've got a situation here.
Jim where the hell have you been?
She's on my list.
She's finished you hear me?
All I know is I did it I
Door was open.
And how did you get in the school?
And when did you do it?
I'm the one.
What is it.
Well this is hard for me but I think it's important to be honest.
what do you have to tell me?
I'll just be outside.
Please just wait outside.
You wanted to see me Mr.
You're the one who --
You know it's not true.
What do you want Jim?
Three twenty-five.
Come by after school.
Like you wanted.
All his life.
He's tried everything.
Shall we give it a name?
Should we get a what?
Should we get a room?
Let go; live a little.
More this way.
Without Dave around.
Could you get this?
Just one more thing.
We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.
A whole year in fact.
You know more like the radio station ones.
I want to talk to Mr.
about some important stuff.
Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
And now you can make a decision.
Okay let's say
That's more like a...
She's always working so hard and --
The other kids look up to you.
But you've got a big choice right now.
And maybe go on to...
My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's.
I get the same as you Jim.
Looks like Paul's our president.
Well, I do.
But other people can see them too.
These are private -- these are for us.
People can see this.
We were just...
Oh, no, hey.
Maybe we can just --
You're her brother you should know.
I mean at you.
She's doing this to get back at me
And Paul was first.
We're brother and sister.
It was great working with you.
Have a great summer.
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea...
Well, see, I was talking to Mr.
and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
you know, I just thought --
Oh, one more thing.
But that's okay, you know.
We're still brother and sister.
and I hope you feel the same.
Well, I think that would be a good thing.
Paul, get out!
Just look at this list and point.
What do you want, Mr.
How's the left these days?
So tell me about it.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
He's more like me.
You found me.
But not for long.
Where'd this come from?
I want to see you again.
Actually, it was two.
You're different, Officer White.
But you did it anyway.
This is how they turned out.
But do you know?
What kind of question is that?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Somebody hit you?
Imagine the police in control.
Give me one minute.
Will you work for me?
Him and me both.
Yeah, I hate them.
And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
I got to write my report first.
Seen him around.
A great big one.
What's through here?
Look at a picture for me.
He was too old for you.
I went out one day and old Mrs.
I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
A lot of bad stuff happened here.
It's as good a place as any for it to end.
You called it.
You wanted to meet here?
He sent you after me.
He had help getting up there.
Which one are you and which one am I?
We build a case.
Then something goes wrong.
What were they up to?
She told you?
You expect anyone to believe that?
One in six.
I run call girls.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Where's the other guy?
The last time, you people called at my office.
I'm not asking you.
Before your day.
If she knew him she would've been sitting with him...
But she's moving away from the door.
Who was sitting at this table?
You know how it goes.
That's the way to get him.
I know that, sir.
I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Just show me where they are!
Where do they get their stuff?
Man, what're you saying?
you feel that way about people, too?
His business is his business.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
So you're twenty-two, right?
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
Say what and so what.
In my car.
Okay so we worked together.
What does that have to do --
It's for your own safety.
As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.
And now you'll provide them.
I sent him to make the buy.
The rest is history.
There always are.
I'll break them, sir.
Yes, I do, sir.
Sir, I took the call.
It's my case.
He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
Or my father.
It's three A.
And who knows what else?
You want to talk to him?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
I want to do it right.
No one even knew who he was.
My whole life.
Yesterday yes, today no.
What happened last night?
Yesterday that might've meant something.
Pull me off.
I need to know what White knows.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I need to speak to you.
I get the idea.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
For the last time.
Some men get the world.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Right now, before I back down.
I think he's behind all of this.
There's more if you want to hear it.
I'll take your word for it.
I want to know why you see him.
How about White?
Oh, the best I ever had.
Absolutely the best.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.
How did he put it?
What did White say?
On what evidence?
These are police.
Under the house.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs.
I was just there.
It got called off.
Call me when you get something I can use.
It's well done stuff.
I thought you might have heard something.
It's Christmas!
I need an extra fifty.
It's right around the corner.
We did a piece last year.
'  Her name got mentioned.
I just called it.
Please hold the line...
And no one'll know about this?
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show...
Was it a party?
Have we met before?
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
I need some help here!
Maybe there was someone else--"
who's that?
I just gave him my card.
I'm telling you I--
What'd he give to you?
What'd he say to you?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
I'm not interested in this tape.
I'll come straight there.
Come straight here.
When can you get it here?
Who else have you told?
You've got it on tape?
Listen to me--
You want your old job back?
What kind of a question is that?
Not particularly no.
He came in four minutes ago.
Same way they did with you and me.
They've done it before.
Takes maybe two minutes.
It'd never get through.
And if you did it'd never get on the air.
We're honest people and we need your help.
Yeah I can see where that'd--
We lost 'em.
Think we let out enough air?
And turn your head.
They're here.
Take a walk with me.
Did you find anything?
They come after you?
Why'd you leave?
That was twenty years ago.
whatever we wanted.
Anyone we wanted.
How do you know so much?
I called my wife!
I mean did you call anyone.
Did you call anyone?
But you're right you should shop around and get the best price.
I'll just let you out here.
We said a hundred.
And take this.
How many years have you been running?
What'd they do to you?
What if I find out what they're after.
Look you gave me some work over the last year.
We'll call it even.
What you did who you were...
that's done.
Which they probably are right now.
That's who they are.
What do they have to do with this?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Who was that other guy?
You knew the deal.
Ah sir you know it's not for me to say.
Well then who can?
Well sir I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.
Right on top of the bag.
Is it okay?
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here?
Not about this but...
For that matter I think you will too.
I think she'll like this very much.
of several years...
and I'd like to buy...
as a Christmas present...
Do you see anything you like?
I know but--
For your wife?
Not that I could see.
Was he with anyone?
Did he give you anything?
I'm happy to help you all I can.
What kind of trouble.
I thought you might know something.
It was a bus.
A police report.
No sir I'm not involved with that.
A friend of mine.
He's dead now.
I wish you could've met...
It's really over?
That was for Christmas.
Now I know there's no reason to believe me.
And I love our son.
So just believe me anyway.
What happened to your head?
This is my house.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Has anyone been by?
He'll be--
I went to the bank to see why.
No I was with her yesterday.
I want you to do it right now.
I know but listen--
Leave this house.
It's not real...
I see her for business.
How could you let me find out like this?
Well you know--
Yeah but you said you've never met him.
How did you--
Same guy as always.
Who did you work with to get the--
The thing is when I saw him it seemed like he wanted to tell me...
Something bad happened tonight.
Not a very good one but--
Here you can use this.
Good news there Mr.
That's probably not you in the picture.
Why the hell would I--
I'll see if I can you know work things out.
Actually that's not true.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Any idea what he looks like?
It's not me?
What makes you think it's you?
You want your job back?
You want a life?
This conversation's over.
When you needed information I got it.
I've never met him?
For the last four years.
Will you hang on just a second.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
You got a minute?
You're just what I need right now.
All right look--
Eat your fish.
How can I be sure.
Why would I--
Other than me.
So you've said.
It's how he works.
What answer were you--
When do I get to meet him?
Here's what you asked for.
Not that much.
Do you like fish?
It is fish.
You may have to--
We'd rather not--
Otherwise you may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
You may have to what?
We believe he did.
If I could--
Forget me forget what I did for you.
You want money?!
Put David on it.
Oh well that's true.
Why would the Union--
Well that's why I'm here Mr.
What are you talking--
It's okay to use the phone.
How long can you stay?
Can I open 'em up?
Some of 'em.
Turn yourself in.
Piece of advice?
I'm sorry man.
I have a family.
Make a deal.
Tell 'em to stop.
No listen to me.
Why would they--
They're the ones doing this.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Usually they take clothes.
Did they take your clothes?
It's been a few years.
I worked on--
What does that have to do with you?
He got hit by a bus.
Well we'd sure like to help you.
I'm not asking you to say for certain.
It's hard to say for certain these things are--
It means who's side are you on?
What the hell does it mean?
He walked right up to me in church.
Myself and two others.
What about the tape?
Resources that's a good point.
He's got resources.
You find 'em and you end it now!
If they've looked at the video.
So they know everything.
And they have the video.
I want the tape and I want him.
I just meant--
No no I'm sorry.
He had help?
It was in his bag.
Now it's not.
We'd have to--
I need to own him.
Am I to understand--
Hit by a bus.
The door was open sir.
How'd you get in the building?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Now is that clear?
Tell me about your garden.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
I know he's dead.
And a good read.
And there's plenty of water and food.
You can have a party.
In our garden.
And then I'll be back and we'll be fine and I'll never leave you.
Shall we be all right?
I'll make a fire.
It's so cold.
I always wear it.
Why did you hate me?
I know darling I'm sorry.
We've got to get you out of here.
Why did he bring you?
I want the things which are mine.
Is he next?
Would you let me pass?
I'd better get back.
A different wife.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.
A different life.
And here I am a different wife.
I can stay tonight.
This - what's it called?
- this place I love it - this is mine!
This is - what is this?
Say you're sick.
When you leave you should forget me.
What do you hate most?
I could go on all day.
What do I love?
And what do you love?
When were you most happy?
I believe you still have my book.
Will you please come in?
Will you not come in?
No but I think I do.
Do they know them?
Cut out its heart.
I should like to have them.
Oh my God the others!
Absolutely is not.
This is not very good is it?
What am I looking at?
I'm quite all right thank you.
Of course it would.
There's really no need.
I'd like you to have them.
Her or me?
You mean you - or me?
He said - be careful.
What is he saying?
Come on what did he say?
So why follow me?
As the wife of one of our party.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
This is not worth eight pounds Mrs.
Seven pounds eight I suppose.
How much did you pay?
Do you all know this story?
but I can tell a story.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.
Sorry what's your point?
All the same I were I you I would be concerned -
She told me yesterday.
There you have me.
Still a car.
Look listen to me.
I have been walking for three days!
The Officer is writing this down.
And what's your name sir?
Am I not talking sense?
Could I trouble you for some water?
But I hope someone looks after you.
So if you need ithard to know how long one's talking about.
We might all be back in a month or two.
I'll be ready.
I'll look after it for you.
So now you can say I told you so.
Had a letter from my wife.
Absolutely right shut up.
Look either shut up or go home.
Good we're all here?
I believe I'm rather late.
In my room.
I'll be back as quick as I can.
Thirty-six hours at the outside.
I was talking about the girl.
I looked at them.
Why should we wait until we're in London?
This girl was probably twelve years old.
Just stop please and listen to me.
It would mean such a lot to me.
No I'll get you some tea.
You'll find a girl there.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Well you must know.
A girl comes up and points at you you only see trouble.
Look - give me something.
So we can all get out of this room.
It's too hot.
It is you.
You've got the wrong man.
I can get in the back.
Well then ask him his name!
No-one should own music.
Where did you find that?
How could he have?
What if I told you he did this to me?
I'm not in love with him.
And so is he.
I'll have some of your water.
It's hot.
You know what's great?
You should be happy.
It's a week.
I could help you.
I could get you off that.
I'm not looking.
Look it's a big house.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.
Before you go.
I'd like to stay.
That's the long and short of it.
I have to do some work here -I speak the language.
Yeah for a while.
She said I should stop and see if you were okay.
I died years ago.
To come back for her.
Is that what you thought?
There was a result to what you did.
It did this.
The rest meant nothing to me.
I'd seen you writing in that book.
And a name.
We shall miss you.
I've had a drink.
It's mine now.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Are you outside?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
You've got the wrong end of the stick old boy.
Oh all over.
I do so love you.
If you wanted.
Come on I'll take you home.
I'm hot.
I'm too hot.
I got hot.
Darling I just heard.
Well she is!
Off with his head!
We are all save my friend here.
Oh no really.
She has her book.
Did you look?
Would you like me to?
You'd better be.
I've been told that before.
That's a big job.
Yes of course I'm so sorry.
Could I ask you to move?
Well then - yes.
This is as private as we'll get.
Just go off.
I'll be quite all right.
Can I ask - my friend can he come in?
Just for a few minutes?
There's a war.
He might stay.
I can see my wife in that view.
How can you see anything?
I can already see.
I should try and move your bed.
I want you to be able to see the view.
Go on please.
Yes we can read him.
What about your own book?
You're too heavy!
So one day we'll meet.
I'll always go back to that church.
Is that what you think I think?
I mean home.
This is hot!
It's red hot.
That makes me never want to come here.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
I try not to expect you.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday!
I do this every day.
Before I cut.
But he hands them over.
You must get away.
So many people have died around me.
I've done this.
I've had to do this.
Why would anyone do this?
It's okay - I'll help.
It's all about men.
Too many men.
Just like this house.
Yes for your hair.
For my hair?
I've met you before.
No but no not at all.
Is something funny?
He's - no.
For all of us.
The war's over - you told me yourself.
Not this morning.
Does he have to go?
Is it a mine?
Only we have to go to work.
Very kind of you we can always eat in the town with the others -
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I was looking forward to this evening.
We can do that when we're very very old.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I'm afraid so sir.
Am I needed?
Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!
Darling Peter says I could stay
I shall be absolutely fine.
You should sit down darling.
She's quite all right.
Go on do it.
Would they do that to a White Man's City?
What have I been doing all this time?
This is wonderful!
Or my wife's.
This was your garden?
I remember a lot of things.
I was with them for some time.
Whatever you're doing stop.
He's on to something bigger.
I'm in the middle.
Got to go.
I know what I'm doing.
We're getting close.
Which you have in mind.
With that computer--nobody better.
it's different.
It's not the thinking of it it's the doing it.
You got a better idea?
He left the window open when he came in.
That's great if you're a computer.
Through a window.
They've been on to you all along.
But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
Nothing is wrong.
Everything is the way it has to be.
Put this on!
The door's the only way out!
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.
You could come too.
Very easy to do.
Have really held you under?
But would you--would you--
But that's all behind us now.
You have something in mind?
There is one more thing.
No way to take another day or two?
one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
And you're the best so--
There's no way to practice this.
And no time.
We're doing it tonight.
So how long till we do this?
You've thought of everything.
And the money goes--
Where the money is.
From them to us.
Oh my god I thought--
Just for a minute?
Do you know what you've done!?
I always knew you'd do the job.
Hold the record.
Speaking of money.
That's where the money is.
We're living history here.
Get the hell in.
There is no big job.
The big job.
You're making...
No no please God you're wrong.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
They moved it.
Yes you can.
It's a party.
We're working.
My father told me not to be afraid.
He'd always be there for me.
It's not a village.
There's nothing there.
No no I want to.
I'll just go into the village.
You bought this for me?
It's---beautiful.
One more item--not on the check list.
Did I hear a car?
Say a hundred.
Let's do it again.
Oh I think you can do it.
Let's just see how we do.
Must be a really big job.
The rest we just want.
I'll need that.
I believe I've made that point before.
You'll never find one as good as me.
Everyone thinks I did.
I mean me!
Look I can help.
You've got one.
I'll see you get back to London.
We're doing this together.
That's when we'll do it.
And we'll need every single day.
Only a week?
In a week.
I know it well.
We'll start in twenty minutes.
And good morning.
We've got a job to do.
You want a list?
I'm doing the job.
Where's my bag?
Certainly not mine.
Those are my clothes.
I never carry...
I'm not the one to ask...
It's one way.
What the hell do I do now?
He says they turned the card down.
That's what you're buying.
A film case.
Look on the back.
Give him the card.
I'm paying...
one point five million and change.
I hate round numbers.
How much am I paying?
It's a test.
Quite a good one.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Maybe I should drive this time.
I'd do it myself.
This just means so much to me.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Oh that's quite all right.
Why would I be?
Oh I'm taking you...
I've got something...
It's nothing serious.
I'll just run into that building.
Seems I am.
Meet me in front.
It's sold.
That is of no interest.
I have a question...
It has to be tomorrow.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Takes a lot out of you one like this.
But when you find the one person who really knows you and then you lose her...
The night she died?
Thought you had to use some of these.
You're giving them to me?
Value: one million each.
It's a bank job that's all I know.
To yourself that's where.
It's not just me you got to worry about.
It's never happened before.
What makes you think it's happening now?
It is can it be?
Give her that.
Almost as good as she thinks she is.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
This is just show and tell.
Which is what's on my mind.
Check out my ball.
Oh look at me darling.
We're supposed to.
You two make quite a couple.
We better do this tonight.
It better be worth it for me.
Black of course.
I need you to get one more thing for me.
It's never big enough.
This is big enough.
She has another job after this one.
A big one.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit.
And you do it so well.
sometimes you're not half-bad.
All of 'em?
What do I have this afternoon?
What the hell is this doing here?
He's a low-life.
You want him?
There's two.
There's more than one?
I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
And get someone to help around the house.
Any school you want.
I can put them in a good school.
It's enough -- for whatever you need for whatever your girls need for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
A number for the whole group or for us?
It's a good day.
He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
And everything you all have is on that list.
They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
That's why we went to see the doctor.
Well hell maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Why would they do that?
Paid for a check-up for the whole family.
They just took care of it.
We never even saw a bill.
Yeah I'm real sorry to hear that.
You know I've been sick.
Me and Peter both have.
I should learn to do stuff like that.
This is a real nice place you got here.
I just work for them.
That's three percent.
Here what comes?
You see your office?
Give him another chance.
Say you were wrong.
I got a little something for you too.
So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place.
We're having a meeting it's all set up --
They need their money now!
Hey that's not so bad.
Wait what do you mean ten years?
Still a lot of money.
Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
After all I've done for you that's the thanks I get.
No one's taking anything --
And I'm not saying that's bad.
And what I'm not serious?
Look this is serious now.
They're talking serious money --
It's an important meeting.
I thought you should rest.
but maybe not.
I wish someone else had to make this decision.
So what are you thinking?
What kind of things come up?
You might want to think real hard about the amount too.
By the end of the day.
And what do you do for me?
Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?
If you got a problem with Jane work it out for yourself.
Yeah I mind.
I want my fucking money --
Yeah I'm...
Or a make?
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Tell them to wait in the conference room.
Yeah I heard that one before.
I like working with you too.
I like working with you.
I would now.
That's why I like it.
It makes me sick.
I like this case.
That's just not right.
Oh they knew.
They had to know.
That was his job.
The real problem's on the bottom.
You're doing the right thing Mr.
Okay here's the deal -- if and only if you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.
I'll take it on.
A much bigger deal.
A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
You think there's more?
But I know the difference --
We can get these people.
And this shit is bad news Mr.
It's not about working hard --
Okay so here's what I'll do.
Boy do I know how you feel.
What you think I'm made of money?
This is the only thing you found?
There's a lot of other places I could work.
Course I did.
The one from your office?
So what made you think it was?
So what's the story on this thing?
You were gone.
Well that was nice of him.
And that at the rate you mentioned.
I got an interesting call this afternoon.
Come on I'm trying to help here.
Find you something else okay?
That's not how we work here.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls?
I need to know what to ask for it.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Jane's the office manager.
Just -- for the weekend.
With my kids' well-being.
You said things would be fine and they're not.
You did both.
He seems to think that you said --
You never called me back.
You told me I'd be set.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Oh please it was long over by then.
Open and shut?
I think we should makes some changes.
I've also been thinking about the team.
At the time I thought I got six kids some of 'em want to go to college.
Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.
Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
The water in them.
So yeah I took a look.
I got nothing but time here.
That your middle name?
Come on back.
Would that be okay?
You come to the right place.
Real pleased to meet you.
County water board.
Every county has one.
You should be able to find something there.
Have you been to the water board?
Bad bad stuff.
What would you get?
There's more than one kind?
Where's George?
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
In the conference --
Hey just so long as you see Him.
She's one of the sick people?
There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.
I try real hard.
You always say that.
Whatever you want we'll work it out.
Well I hate it.
That's all you got lady.
Two wrong feet.
Okay look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
And listen good work.
They're a great start.
No I need my car --
You're sick.
Think you could learn?
Yeah well -- good help is hard to find.
And I miss you.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.
They said that'd be tomorrow.
More than you need me.
Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I never had that.
Yeah you can.
People do it all the time.
I'm just working so hard --
So I bought 'em.
Know how long ago that was?
That's a long time.
That is not what I'm --
If you had an office I'd go to your party.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves why do we have to spend it here?
Just a few more minutes then we can go.
Take her will you?
Just tell me about your day.
What went on back there?
I probably know it better than you.
Would that make you happy?
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
There's a lot of jobs out there.
They're wrong.
I am doing the best I can.
I'm just saying --
George I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.
Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
You're someone to me.
You're someone real special to me.
You are someone.
Oh God George how'd this happen to me?
How'd I end up so...
But you been working so hard --
It's a simple thing.
Everybody gets them.
You think it could make you sick living in a place like this?
You're around every afternoon?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Maybe I'm just out of practice.
And I make it last by living cheap.
I work when I need to.
I was serious before you know.
I'm never here.
You need help with your kids?
I could probably do that.
Maybe you'll get your money back.
I bought 'em for you to make up for that night.
And here's another: five.
Seven is my son's age.
You getting all this?
You got a little girl?
That's one of my numbers.
It's how many months old my little girl is.
You got more than one?
Which number do you want George?
You want my number?
Let's start over.
My name's George.
But you hang in there maybe you'll get one.
It's only getting worse.
We've missed you.
I thought maybe you'd know.
It's an awful lot.
It sure could yeah.
But it's good for me.
And it's good for you too.
Not the old lady next door.
You're moving away?
It'll be fine yeah.
So it's good?
Were you a good girl?
So I went and asked.
Their parents I'm pretty sure.
No one put me up to anything.
Yes My Lord.
We'll find them.
there is another.
The boy is our last hope.
Told you I did.
It can save you.
You are our only hope.
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.
We've come this far...
He is our only hope.
He's too old.
Too old to start the training.
All his life has he looked away...
Never his mind on where he was on what he was doing.
He can do it.
And that is why I must go.
It is you he wants...
You're not ready yet.
You still have much to learn.
I can help them!
you are the only hope.
I'm cold...
We're not out of this yet.
I'm sure I'll see you again too.
No I'm alright.
It would've been worth it....
How could you know my father?
Oh your father...
Not far not far.
Soon you will see him.
Will it take long to get there?
How far away is he?
It's time to eat.
But now eat we must.
Good food I have good food.
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'll stay and help you find your friend.
My home this is.
Or I'll help you not.
Have you tried?
Not many on those.
Help you I can...
You've found someone I'd say.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
You bet it is...
Check on it!
I have seen it.
I have felt it.
But they'll have to take care of themselves.
A death mark is not an easy thing to live with...
Thank you General.
But there's a price on my head.
I hate to lose you.
I'd say you're all set...
He'll be in soon.
What's the situation?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're in trouble!
Sit down and shut up!
get out of here.
I do hope he's all there...
No one seems to know...
I shut it off.
Might I have a word with you?
I'm sure he's fine.
I want to check this out.
You look silly.
And keep your eyes open.
Not many but you do have them.
your kind of guy.
Never heard of that system.
Got any ideas?
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Oh so sorry!
You heard me turn around!
There will be more of them.
Just what we need right now.
There's something out there!
Try and control this...
I do not!
You mean a man you can control.
I happen to like nice men.
Only trying to help.
Where have I heard that before?
They're moving away.
But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
You can let go now....
Looks pretty good.
Now you're making sense.
I'm against that.
Well you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Let's hope so...
it's just the chance we need.
some- thing hit us....
I know I know I see them...
Someone's still in here.
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm afraid there's not much left.
If I were interested.
if you'd have let go for a minute.
That's not what I'm talking about.
He'll know when he gets back...
I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
That makes a good story.
I've done what I can for you.
I'm sorry it's not better but I've got my own problems.
What's so important about him?
This ought to be good.
Shut up a minute and listen.
I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Sorry friend I had no choice.
But you wear it well.
Not as well as I'd like.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.
I'll take what's mine now.
We'll test it first.
That was never mentioned.
You will find them well enough.
But they must never again leave this city.
Get under him.
No argument just do it.
We must go back.
I knew that set-up was too good to last....
You'll be lucky to get out yourself.
What chance have we got in here?
Sure I did...
What do you say we debate this later?
There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
We have no use for your kind.
Look I stand to lose everything by this.
I'm coming over to your side that's what.
Most of our trade is well...
What have we here?
and who might you be?
We have no choice.
Send them up...
They're working on it now.
It's not much but...
Nothing more can be done tonight.
I thought you knew this person.
Well what now?
Oh my no!
You rest now.
they're here?!
I have this...
I'm not sure really...
What did you say?!
What would you think if I went away for a while?
when I was out there and it looked pretty bad...
well it made me think about things.
If it must be.
You have far to go in your training.
They're my friends.
Difficult to see.
Always in motion is the future...
Back away little machine!
It is the future you see.
I see them!
I see it too...
Control control you must learn of what you see.
Only what you take with you.
Into it you must go.
I feel cold.
Four this time!
Nothing more will I tell you now.
Clear your mind of questions...
But tell me why...
You will know.
A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
This will not do.
That they are.
Or do not.
There is no try.
I'll give it a try.
Throw them out!
You will be my young one.
You will be.
Ready are you?
What know you of ready?
Come join with me!
All too easy.
And I too.
Where'd they get those clothes?
What am I saying?
Do you have a name?
And we can watch...
May I say something personal?
He's your own kind.
Somebody else was in there with her.
Not unless you give your life.
You're my woman you understand?
Go on now.
We have things to do.
It's so good to see you again.
I thought he was but he came back.
You told me he was dead.
I've done it all man.
Your right-hand man.
Why should we leave?
No one gets near him.
Anything happens to me you're dead.
Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Can you land?
Somebody get off!
We're too heavy.
How are we getting out?
And we get out.
I got one hour.
I got a new deal for you.
All right so I made another deal.
What's in it for me?
It's history.
She's in the green.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
So you want me to take her out?
Is that an order from the President?
So what does this thing do?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
It's already in you.
But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Only on a need to know.
What's the little black box do?
You like the watch?
I give you my word.
If you'd listen...
I said pull over.
We're on the move man.
Right up there.
I want you out.
Looking to get out.
What're you doing in here?
Down that way.
It's not the same as the old days man.
It's where they live.
There are people in some of these cars.
Why do you stay?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
I just thought you wanted to get away.
This is a dead end.
You took us into a dead end!
Like hell I do.
Oh no it's the Doctor.
They live here used to be like us.
It's so great to meet you.
Everybody else there is.
You're running out of time.
Well I'll think it over.
I got ten million of them.
All of us?
I'm looking for somebody.
For now there is no one.
There is one thing left to do...
Is he coming?
You are that and much more.
Now we will be together--
I think we do too.
And a great heart it is.
So be it to the death.
Good day to you sir.
He can be no other.
I have lived through others far too long!
I will see him I must.
Your love brought me back.
Where have you been these many years?
But I'm here.
I must not.
Here I must stay.
I must do it myself.
And by you.
Perhaps most of all by you.
What is it my child?
Never where you expect it that's all I know.
Then answer me this.
At your service sir.
Take it quickly!
You know full well there is and I go to meet it now.
Your heart is not.
Who will it be?
Put your mind to it then.
What's this what's this?!
Open before you all around us.
In the great book.
You and only you.
It's just that I have no experience and no men to speak of.
How can I--
I must find the means to save him then.
You already know what must not happen.
Yes yes I know that.
' Help me get up.
That's not why you came.
I want to thank you.
Your mother told you that?
Who is then?
I did Father.
I have kept it.
Not you my husband?
But I have to leave tomorrow.
You and the land are one.
You my lord.
He has given up.
There are things about love--
There is one.
That is enough.
--It must wait child.
I have found you.
The world is that big?
Listen boy it's more than twenty days from here.
I will run.
You're a man?!
I have paid enough for you and I will have you.
Mine is great.
You know what I want.
Sit with me please...
You are young...
You left your husband's side?
I have come for him.
Now you must pay me.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time.
Sometimes I give sometimes I take.
It is mine to know which and when.
Speak the words.
Well what's wrong?
It must be alright.
How's his health?
No he's working on another book.
What's he doing there?
It might be best to have a man with experience.
No not really I suppose.
It has worked in fact although not for the reason they think of course.
You're sorry.
I'm not putting her away!
Where do you want this?
Did you put it there?
What did the doctor say?
Oh I should of known better.
Yes this is Mrs.
Just five or six people.
What is it a big party or something?
Dinner at the White House.
Oh great anything else?
You're a nice man.
It's for me.
Oh she'd love it.
I hate to ask you this but...
When she's well enough I'll ask.
Would you like some more coffee?
Want to ask him?
So how could this be?
May I ask...?
It's serious?
A man to see you.
Yes I go now.
I'm building a new house the old one's been sold.
Are you planning to be home soon?
Well of course I'm sure.
I'd tell you.
Of course not nothing like that.
Did you see her or not?
Tell me something good.
Could last for days even weeks.
The whole thing with me on it!
Let's wait.
Let's wait and see.
She used those words.
She used those words?
Well what for example?
I think that's the answer.
Wait two or three weeks.
Well you mentioned her father...
He's already here.
Well I think you should.
Have you told him what's happening?
It's fine really sit.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
It's not important good night.
Yes I did I'm sorry.
Did you know my mother died recently?
You tell me that!
I'll have to look it up.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Oh will you help her!
Just help her!
Could you see her?
You could do it yourself...
That takes time.
Oh yeah since when?
If he came to you for help would you have to turn him in?
Did he tell you about my party?
It's the other way around.
Oh I'm very sorry Father.
So something please Doctor Help her!
Oh please mother make it stop!
Make it stop!
What's wrong!!
He wants us back.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Oh you did.
I'll always love your daddy.
Do you not like him like daddy?
But you like him.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Yeah I like him.
You like him.
Well you know it's okay.
You can bring Mr.
We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh I love you.
Well what would you like to do?
It's not even a good picture.
Oh I bet he is.
He's nice.
Oh yeah well let's both play.
Wait a minute you need two.
You know how?
You've been playing with it?
Hey where'd this come from?
Oh it's so funny.
Oh look at that.
When can I have one?
We'll see when we get home okay.
What did you do today?
I call you.
What goes down there?
So what's wrong with her?
You know the story same thing here.
There was nothing you could do.
Where'd you get it then?
The poor box?
Had your lunch?
What's playing.
Would you like to go?
Ah that's good.
That's all that's important.
Back to business.
Bye now Father.
She seemed fine.
How's the girl?
You just missed them.
I am no one!
You and us.
It would bring us together.
You'd like that?
For this is my body.
I'll see that she gets it.
I'm a friend of your mother I'd like to help you.
You are not happy.
Tell me what is the matter?
Oh really when?
You're not my mother!!!
Can you give her something?
Why this girl it makes no sense?
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
There's only one.
So far there seems to be three.
The Large one.
Go pick on them.
You know who I think really did it?
That's to bad.
Look Father this is hard for you- please.
You'd know that.
I once did a paper on it
You've seen him.
Yeah it's true.
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!!
Yes I am her brother he's the son
We want to see Mrs.
Do you want him to leave you?
If I ask him to tell me will you let him answer?
Me I love you.
You're class.
But people today.
Right twelve years.
Couple times a month.
Take it now.
Why not tomorrow?
Just the same.
You could use some sun.
Where are our kids?
Has he got one of them in there?
Well look at this.
Nothing's the matter.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week...
What do you do to him?
How will he eat?
Then the heart goes.
Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Let's get him up here.
What's wrong with them?
What's our friend's problem?
Come on friend.
Get yourself a cup of coffee.
Get your hand off me.
My brother and I.
Two at a time?
Here comes Dad.
Oh look at you two.
Behind some of Dad's stuff.
I thought these were lost.
Where did you find...
Oh well what's in a name right?
How's the birthday girl?
When they coming in?
She asked for it.
Christ that's right.
It was someone's birthday.
Five years ago.
I mean you can play.
You know that night I...
It just all came up.
How're your hands?
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Looks like we can have that drink after all.
Oh yeah right.
No it's not that.
Bought it on the way over.
I set it for Wednesday.
It's okay?
It was all worked out before you know.
She and Dad had taken care of it.
Is everything done?
If you want to get started.
No let's stay on it.
Stay off it.
What-are you?
Who's watching?
What's seventy-one?
We're against it.
We get nothing.
We're not getting paid then.
Just until we find another girl.
How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
That takes care of this week.
You ever go back there?
Where it happened.
I could've.
You could've come.
Yeah but he told you things.
He never told me anything.
It was always you two running off doing things together.
I always think of him on New Year's.
I still have to look at the music sometimes you know that?
Otherwise I forget.
I just forget.
You never forget.
The way you never looked at the music.
When's the last time we were there?
They want us back.
Only not for kids.
No you're wrong.
It's just beginning.
Come on have a drink.
Show your big brother how it's done.
What're you doing down here?
He had to come quickly.
I called him.
You saw wrong.
What're you trying to do?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you walking around the street somewhere.
Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
I came up with the idea on the road.
Like he wants to line something up.
What the hell are these?
Yeah well she's our girl now.
There's trouble there.
Hey listen to this.
Just wonder what she's up to.
I never see her.
Two hours ago!
How long you been at it?
What's it look like I'm doing?
All that talk about family.
I just wanted to say it.
Thank you thank you.
And it's their hope that before you leave everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.
Understand little brother?
So why should you care?
I never hear it!
I think what Mr.
A big deal?
Why would I mind?
For a week.
No you take the right.
Unless you want the right.
I'm putting my stuff on the right okay?
That one I remember.
It'll be like when we were kids.
Enjoy the view.
All right but if you change your mind let me know.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow?
Yeah well what can I say?
Dad must've had forty pounds on me.
Jesus you remember him being this big?
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
That's what I figure.
Ah here we go.
How about these?
Here how's this?
She's here.
I just wish she'd get here that's all.
You hit me.
Come on stand still.
How's my hair?
She'll get here.
I told everyone seven-fifteen.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I'll call the girl.
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's there to talk about?
That makes her the only one in the class.
I just thought we should talk about it.
You would think someone...
Thirty-seven girls.
It never was.
All these years you been telling me we're different.
I thought maybe twenty percent.
By both of us.
That's what we agreed.
It's just an idea.
Sure why not.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.
Look can we forget last night?
Yeah and what put him up there?
That how you see it?
I got two kids.
I got a wife.
No one paid us off.
Some political dinner or something.
Look good as new.
So you'll come out right?
At the house.
So talk to me tomorrow.
It's not family.
come out to the house tomorrow will ya?
Everything's great.
So what'd we get her?
Your older brother.
It's only a ring.
You seeing anyone?
I'm not seeing anyone.
Why the interest?
Seeing anyone in particular?
Only on odd days.
You know I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything.
How do you explain that?
The little one...
They're always asking about you.
Say hello to the kids.
So we on tomorrow night?
You mind telling me what that was about in there?
Of course back then things were a little different.
Come on we're on.
Christ will you look at your hair?
I always get here.
How we doing?
So what'd you think?
We would've come and got you.
he knows it.
'  Is that all right?
Well that's fine --
It's my stage name.
Actually that's my stage name.
This is my brother.
You find a girl?
You're an hour and a half late.
How should I take it?
This is show business?
We're finished.
And two more times tomorrow night and two more times the next night and the next night and the next night and the next night.
It's one more show.
They love it.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
What's with you two?
He's just afraid to show it.
Hey will you look at that?
We got a picture though.
God we were just kids.
You ever see her again?
Hot that night.
And how about this air?
I'm telling you a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Same with music.
He's always right.
Hey look at this.
You play all these places?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
For the kids.
I'll call him.
Did you hear it?
And you say...
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
All right but make it quick.
What size do you wear?
We're not exactly silly with time you know.
Save it for your wife.
Here how about this?
I wear a seven.
What do you wear?
If you ask me this is pretty stupid.
Time for what?
Is there a language problem here?
Where's my name?
Christ look at her.
So work with me not against me.
What I mean is --
When we know.
we'll let you know.
I think that's all we need to know.
Is that important?
But not with each other.
Yes well they are.
That'd be me sir.
Lucky for you.
She a local?
You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Shit thank God.
They never do Mr.
Bring him back.
I'll take a look.
You want to know if he's okay.
You can check in on him tomorrow.
Between eight and five.
Thought I'd check in on him.
Yes well it's probably best.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.
Is that the way it is?
It went well tonight.
I should get home.
Well now where's everyone run off to?
Let me get the light.
If I see him.
I've given it up.
you want to get a drink?
I got a new place.
Or we could go to a bar...
Well maybe not a bar.
None of the important ones.
So how's the cat food business?
There's always another girl.
You can always get another girl.
I think I started a fire.
Look if you want to leave...
So what's it doing here?
He called her.
The both of them?
The older ones they were okay.
Must've been a cheap date.
I never get over it.
How many people live here?
Maybe I can help you find her.
And they knew you were good!
All I said was you were good.
Better than that.
Not many but a few.
Like a baby.
God's music my mother used to say.
With the light always on it's hard to tell.
So why's he do it?
He do that every year?
With us working together and all.
You want me to walk you?
You feel like a cup of coffee?
What's tomorrow again?
He takes after our mother.
Why throw away a night?
With my mother.
He'll come around.
My brother here?
The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Ah you know.
Can I stay here tonight?
Even if she comes here?
How'd yours go?
How'd the show go?
Ever go to church?
Hey what do you want to do?
Older than me.
Is that what you used to do?
How's that dog of yours?
Big piece or little?
You mean if I get sick?
Yeah real fine.
No one knows you're his father.
But hell I never thought I'd see you again either.
Of course he is...
-- He's yours too.
I'm not the same person you remember.
He's your brother you figure it out.
Why would he need more?
Obviously he found a way to make more.
How could you forget that?
Let me have a look.
You're not my brother.
That's what they always say.
-- Or maybe all at once.
How could you do this to yourself?
How could you do this to us?
Do you know -- do you know what he did to me...?
Why point it at me?
How did he expect to do that?
I know you -- you're the one who called.
He's said and done things your husband would never do...
Never mind that!
Is someone there?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?
Okay go on!
You said you'd be here!
What could be more important than that?
It's important...
Totally -- you were being very very bad.
We were back in high school.
we just remember how it used to be.
Everything I say is wrong.
Well you tried.
Just make sure you're there.
He's nothing like you.
The left I think.
He's coming into work.
That's the good news...
I just asked you about making love to your wife and you started talking about your job.
You're supposed to make time.
When was the last time you told her you love her?
I've been working night and day.
Okay I missed the last one.
What -- what are you doing?
Stay away from my family!
Or maybe God really is on my side after all.
You'll what?
I've never been more certain of anything.
Get everyone in position.
I'd like to be here for you.
You can have it back.
There's my little darling.
What are you -- stupid?
Like you know anything about it.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here.
Daddy's a new man.
You have something I want.
You've got someone in your office.
Obviously someone else knows it!
Where should I be?
Where's everyone else?
Like I fucking care?
I'm not just sitting here!
All of them do.
Your present's in here.
Are you TRYING to give us away?
The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
You better get used to it.
I leave it in your able hands.
But something happened...
There's just one problem.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
Normally I would.
I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Sure baby -- go anywhere you want.
I'll deal with her later.
Like a completely different person.
I'll have a talk with her.
By the way you never said anything about last night...
But -- you drive.
I know how difficult it is for you but we still have to go.
Unless it's upstairs with you...
You always say that -- then you leave.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Remember what my brother called you?
Do you think that's true?
What is with you tonight?
Oh that's right -- you're a doctor.
As much as ever.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.
Call the group.
So you left her?
But I think I like you better this way...
The problem is that what you think is yours is really mine.
And I know people.
Business is business.
one point seven.
And what do you project for this year?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year?
Is that tonight?
You know that right?
That could be her present...
Is it morning yet?
Where do I go now?
This is day care.
I think I could figure it out.
On a case by case basis...
Do you like kids?
slightly better looking though right?
You look just like him.
They did a pretty good job.
You never really talked to me.
I wanted to talk to you man...
yes we went to high school together.
I went to high school with you...
Where were you born?
Hey is that really necessary?
What is it about you?
You start thinking...
Trouble at work?
But what do I do?
let it come to you.
Figure it out?
Figure what out?!
Do I look like I need your money.
Look I just want my life back.
How much money...?
As long as it takes to figure it out.
How much time?!
You got plenty of time.
Look eventually everybody gets one...
On Christmas too!
I was moved...
Brought what on myself?!
you brought this on yourself.
What the hell is happening to me?!
You brought this on yourself...
Sure it's about you.
But it's about society too.
Look I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
It must be great being you.
You got it all.
I've got everything I need.
You just said everyone needs something.
Everyone needs something.
Oh man you're serious...
Yeah in most cases that'd be true.
Nice doing business with you...
That's just not for me...
Like I said it's a business deal...
Look I'm talking about a business deal here.
You leave now.
I know about this!
It would help me if we were.
Well do whatever it is you do well and just...
just do it.
you always do...
Is he here yet?
hold it right there...
To you too...
Nice night for it.
Right back there...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Can we just take a minute here?
Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Not with what they pay me...
it was right here...
How I am right now right this very moment.
I want to do that.
I need to do that as a man...
What about my job?
For the week?
My god all this time...
What are you sure about?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...
where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I mean yes I help people that need it...
But you always seem so certain.
Well maybe a few things.
Worse you mean...
I used to be so sure about everything you know?
I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted.
just say it.
I need to tell you something.
How do you even know about this place?
can we afford all this?
I know that but...
You never wait all day.
No open it...
Maybe I should wait...
You make me hot...
You make me so hot...
Then say it...
just say it to me...!
Yeah baby I know what you like to hear...
I want it...
How would you look at it?
If you want to look at it that way...
In the Village?
We were young...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
That is the general idea yes...
I was watching that!
Here you go...
Who has a phone like this anyway?!
You look forward to this party all year.
this is not my house...
New York City?
I was in the city.
What kind of man does that!?
Right for us.
But in my heart...
All in one tape?
Not yet anyway...
For one thing you like expensive things.
I get it...
Then leave it in the past.
And God love you for it.
Hey are you okay?
Is that good enough for you?
I've got plenty of places to go.
I'm taking the train...
Would you like to come?
I'd like that too.
You're not bad yourself...
Last night was great...
Am I good or what?
Hey kind of under a little pressure here.
Everybody <i>else</i>...
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
""<i>Real</i>""?
What is that <i>thing</i>?
<i>look at your hands</i>.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
What're you getting at?
Time's up...
With only forty-two minutes left.
The less time the better.
Not until the very last second.
We must think of something...
Something to save the situation.
We still have fifty-one minutes.
Leave them in.
But we have no choice!
We've got to take them out!
Yes we'd like to get moving.
Oh yes great.
Just one General...
Who -- or should I say what from?
Oh yes I've heard of you Doctor.
Not even for a minute!
It's only for an hour --
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
But this takes it.
Say that again?
I've got a few things to check out.
Wish I knew why.
Ever hear of him?
-- and why we need you.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
The Other Side got to him.
I'll be standing by.
<I'll> know.
What'll happen to him?
He certainly is.
He should be up and about in no time.
Not when we've come this far.
But big enough for us...
Never saw <that>.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
I -- I want to say...
That's why you're really here.
I knew it from the start.
What gives you that idea?
A great deal more than that I believe...
That's what they pay me for.
I feel much better now...
No need to get up --
Open it before they get here!
If we had the parts.
Maybe that'll do it.
But I did.
I'm positive!
Doctor -- is it possible?
That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
And if it should take more time to get through --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
A long time with one man.
I've been with him since I got out of school.
Now I know...
You may learn to like it.
Just think of it --
What're you talking about!
You left something out.
I'll do nothing of the sort!
But if it does there's no telling how long it will hold up.
We must go on.
I've got to get out!
Doctor what's wrong?
You said there was a quick way out!
We'll have to get out on our own!
Is there a quick way out?
Doctor we've just about had it.
How does it look Doctor?
Then why not take it?
So we can by-pass all this?
We'll never get there in time at this rate.
No there's no other way.
Maybe we can...
And you made it possible!
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes!
Not in the little time we have left!
Sorry but the situation has changed.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Just what it is.
We ought to be clear of them soon.
I always had an idea there was only one System.
It's possible --
Let's hope...
There's no other way.
Well we better get on with it.
In a way -- yes.
At this size I would certainly think so.
If there's any chance --
Tell them to take us out.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do.
About forty miles an hour.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour Mr.
Nothing wrong with us!
Not a thing!
We're fine -- just fine!
Oh -- sure sure!
Come on -- it's no use!
Get this on.
Maybe I can be of some help...
What I was afraid would happen.
Thirty-two minutes left...
Yes by all means.
We must try it.
But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
I'll never find my way through that.
Better come down and have a look!
I'm sorry sir but -
Yeah I just came in.
I decided not to park here.
What do you mean you decided not to park here?
I am through fucking around!
What's this sir?
It certainly is officer.
This is a new car then sir?
Ya find the work interesting do ya?
Just in town on business.
Just in and out.
A little of the old in-and-out!
Clear him off the road.
You'll take care of it.
"" First thing you've said in the last four hours.
Okay here's an idea.
Or your fucking wife you know.
Okay real good then.
Now we had a deal here!
A deal's a deal!
I'm coming into town tomorrow.
Have the money ready.
The price is now the whole amount.
Well I'm sorry but I just - I -
We need more -
And we need more money.
Let's just finish up this deal here -
What the - how's -
Okay so there's that.
So there's that on top then.
It's all worked out.
Yeah you already said that.
Well okay it's -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it!
Come on down and get it!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five.
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Both of these.
He's three now.
Course not in that picture.
You have children?
They can really take over that's for sure.
It'll change your life a course.
This'll be our first.
We've been waiting a long time.
Ya got that right.
Just a general way.
End a story.
That's a name.
Like I say he was funny-looking.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Can you be any more specific?
Just funny-looking.
In what way?
Where you girls from?
He was a little older.
It's an hour -
See - they no see they only deal with me.
I'll go talk to him.
We'll get the money together.
I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
Ya know that's the deal.
These men they just want money see.
What're they doing?
Look Dad there is no fucking way -
I'm sorry sir I -
Sure right now!
I'm sorry sir?
Well I would know.
but do you know that for sure without -
I'll keep it real short then.
I'm on my way out of town but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down?
Well you can help me.
What is it all about?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Be back in a minute.
Well what do ya mean?
Know who this is?
I mean send it over.
I'm sure they do - ha ha!
So if you could read me -
But the deal's already done I already got the money -
Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Pretty good Mr.
Dad's here.
It's in the lot there.
Ya got the car?
I'm sure sorry.
We been sitting here an hour.
What gives man?
It's my show here.
They want my money they can deal with me.
All the more reason!
They were real clear!
That's final!
It's my deal here see?
In order to close the deal.
That's why you pay him.
I know it's a lot.
I understand it's a lot of money -
You told me about it.
Call 'em up.
Well that's okay I just -
Ya think is Dave open yet?
Somebody shut his lights.
Two of'm're over here.
So what's the deal now?
and then I...
No - I'm sorry!
I was so...
I been so...
She was a year behind us.
No just so I can see ya ya know.
Oh okay I'm sorry.
What can I get ya?
I see that!
It's great to hear from ya.
Oh pretty good.
Okay ya know.
It's quarter to eleven.
How are ya?
Wait for back-up!
There's the car!
We've got a -
We're looking.
And this guy is...
He's living with his parents now.
But ya think he's all right?
saw him last night and he's -
So it's nice up there?
Was it reasonable?
How's the food down there?
Not on your feet too much?
They're real good.
Thanks for lunch.
Boy this thing is really...
His wife's in the hospital has been for a couple months.
Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought.
You call his home?
Nobody at his office knows where he is.
And his wife?
He's at -
This is do-able.
Get your hands off him!
What the hell do you think you're doing...
This is a man...
Take him there.
Let's do this!
I'm a member.
There's no one else here.
You know about this guy?
Yeah both of us.
That's a fucking great man!
you're not supposed to talk about it.
Really what's that?
I found something new.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
That was his idea.
We're men.
Men is what we are.
We're still men.
I can do this job from home.
You find this.
Some of it yes.
You can deal with anything.
It must've been Tuesday.
Well if any ideas come to you give me a call.
I'll ask the questions son.
Who do you think could've done this?
Maybe I died already.
I did I think.
But I'm okay...
Just get on.
I'm not paying this back.
Okay if that's what it takes you'll never have to see me again.
Do this for me if you never do anything else...
I'm sorry but I...
No no shut up!
I've had enough.
I have tried...
Leave as soon as possible.
I'll take my food to go...
I know this...
Anyway I've...
I know that I've been...
Absolutely you have every right.
I'm coming over there...
Say my name!
What's my name!?
What did you say...
You love me you hate me.
We did make love?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
He's not here!
He's gone away!
You're afraid to say.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Guy or girl?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor...
Have we been talking too long?
Must we change the subject?
to hang onto?
I think everything's okay here.
You feel nothing?
Okay I'm sure.
You want any?
"" Where are they?
It's time for you to leave.
This could go on for hours.
Might've been too much.
I'm just on my way out...
Look this is a bad time...
It's for men.
I found a new one.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
So we each have three -- that's six.
Now we each have three.
So far you have four and I only have two!
I want that.
It's not my problem.
These are my groups.
I've been coming for a year.
Telling me off.
I'm on to you.
and you come home to this.
let me see...
here's the thing...
I never pick up my phone.
I just called a second ago.
You're the one who did this to me.
Is this part of the test?
You were in here last Thursday night.
it's a test.
Is this a test sir?
How have you been?
I had everything in that bag.
But every once in a while...
Tell the other person how you feel.
""  They always talked about getting better.
Do something for me.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What have you left for me?
You know you will.
If I leave you will be right back where I found you...
I'm doing this for us.
Why are you doing this?!
No more running off without you.
From here on out we do it together.
no no no...
I thank you I really do.
How'd you do that?!
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Can you see alright?
It's out of our hands.
This is the beginning.
I think this is about where we came in.
Was that part of your plan?
I've got everything.
That's the wrong one.
Did you say green?
If I'm wrong we're both dead..
If you know I know.
We both use that body.
Get your mind around that.
to let this happen!
go through with this?
you're fucking her.
You have jobs.
You took me to the house.
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
we were around other people together both of us...
what are you saying?
I asked for one thing from you...
Now look what you've done!
You can see me and hear me but no one else can...
And sometimes you control it...
Sometimes I control it and you imagine yourself watching me...
Is this really news to you?
Why do people think anything?
You talked to her about me.
Why do people think I'm you?
Old too old.
I'm sick of this.
I would feel nothing about my life?
Is that what you want to hear?!
If you died right now how would you feel about your life?
I'm not asking you to.
We are not special.
I want to know --
Should I put this on your ""action item list?
Is it about you and me?
What should I have told you?
Something on your mind?
I thought you did.
Did you start that one?
Do what you like.
I think I understand.
I think I get it...
It's right here.
Look at your hand.
You get rid of her.
You want to finish her off?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house to her or anyone -- I will find out.
And you'll never see me again.
sit here a minute...
Stay away from that one.
You're okay with this?
The things that she said...
I've never heard a woman talk like that...
I mean this girl...
""  It's written in first person.
""  He said ""Get a job.
""  When I turned twenty-five I called him and asked ""Now what?
My father never went to college so it was really important that I go.
Well I knew him till I was six.
Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city new family.
Call what off?
You want to call it off?
Where do you want it?
In the face?
Why not you?
you're the only person I've ever asked.
I want to find out.
I've never been hit have you?
You get the idea.
No one really knows that they've seen it.
But they did.
That's how long it's up there.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Can I stay at your place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Would that be a problem?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Just ask me.
God it's late.
Insurance'll cover it.
There's always that.
And now it's gone.
Keep it up then.
Keep it right up.
How's that working out for you?
So you can say ""Oh that's what you do.
I mean -- for a living.
This is how I met --
Well sir you said you might.
You told me you'd say that too.
You told me you'd say that.
Everything's changed...
Very good Sir.
This is a man -- this man has a name...
What he wanted?
look at him.
This is a person.
It's what he would have wanted sir.
Let go of me!!
Fucking let me go!
You and your friend.
Did you hear what I just said?!
It's free to all.
There is no money.
How much money's he getting for this?
No please no God no!
Would you rather be dead?
Too much school.
Please God no...
I was dead.
And came back to life.
I was in a hospital.
No it's not here.
This one was different.
I'm last on Death's list.
Please what else could it mean?
And something else.
You have to tell us now.
I hope you're ready for this.
Why is this even happening to me?
It usually means the difference between life and death.
That makes you last to go.
Then I'm next!
Death's list.
It's not just about me.
And now I think Death is after me.
I thought you might be able to help me.
She had the baby?
Taken care of.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
He probably already knows we're coming.
He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
We'll get through this.
What about the rest of you?
Who does he think he is?
I've got to stop and help those people.
May we come in?
Yeah so what happened?
But why single me out?
What am I in the great scheme of things?
I can feel it too.
I know what I have to do to save us.
Nothing can happen to us.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Hey I'm a police officer remember?
It sounds all well and good but what if we're wrong?
Where the hell did you find that guy?
Who is this guy anyway?
They're next on the list.
We have to find them.
Then you believe all this??
That Death is working off a list?
It all felt...
Like I said it was like I was there.
Tell me again how it started.
You're not listening to me!
You have to do something!
I saw it happen.
All of us!
No I'm good.
Would you take these?
That it's not over yet.
I will Dad.
Take care of it.
You got it Dad.
I'll call you if I have a problem.
It's Dad.
What on Earth are they doing?
I know we'll be there soon.
When I do this..
and it'll all be over.
You know what to do.
Police are coming.
Get out of the car!
Let us out!
Most kids never have it happen.
and maybe our own...
No but it might as well be the same thing.
from someone or something...
That if we have been aware of...
Four/Twenty-five as in month and day...
From our group?
He's not dead?
That's him but...
he's not here.
But why'd they make him up like...
Then let's go see him!
I wish I could just see him...
one more time then maybe...
I would know.
is just the first...
I wish I could know.
I mean all this...
That's why I was there last night.
You went there?
to see the future.
It's only the end of June.
You think I'm some sort of...
"" What are you God now?!
You should have been next.
If it's not your time...?
Only me right?
we're all on the same list.
Look there's something you should all know.
That's a plan.
Exactly how everything goes.
see there's this...
I believe that...
I got this...
taking another son.
a friend of his.
His best friend.
See his father...
No one's that strong.
He said I'm next.
That's why you're not saying.
Hey man why'd you say that?!
You're the next one...
I'm not afraid!
I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME!
I control my life!
I control my death!
I know what you're doing!
Get control of yourself!
May as well go out under my own free will right?
You have a responsibility to tell me.
So why'd you want us to meet you here?
It's not hard once you get the hang of it.
Anyway I did what I always do when I get one...
They move us around a lot...
Sorry I mean...
I talk to people all the time...
You're taking me home now?
You better take off.
when they tell you to do something and then you do it.
I suppose you have...
You never been in one of those things.
I'm getting him out.
Nothing we can do man.
What's she saying?
We'll check it out.
Let's just do it and get out.
There are no worse places.
I've seen worse places.
They gave me a deal.
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Where's your stuff?
What do you call that?
Keep it down man.
I got problems.
We've been over this three times.
My name is John.
He's coming in on our open side.
I go with you.
They'll use you up and throw you away.
Got some business there.
You think you are...
Anyway you need me.
Took bus most of way.
I knew you would come here.
More than we pay.
Why'd they want us?
It's nice there.
Where's his father?
He twelve now.
Not see him for eight years.
I thought he was with you.
We meet soon.
All our love.
All this is for us?
even for you.
We like you.
in and out.
What's the job?
I thought that's what you wanted.
took the other one.
Sir there's something else...
Just came through.
He's giving them a run for their money.
If it went public?
He put me in a corner.
Word came down...
they wanted an answer.
But it had to look good.
You'll be walking funny.
I'm doing a job here.
I do what I'm told.
But you're right...
Not my people.
This is a war.
It's not necessary.
You think they'll find any?
Let me buy you a coffee.
I could a couple of days ago.
Come to get you out.
You got it sir.
I say we tape him to a chair.
We left some people behind there John...
I just wanted...
after all that...
I just wanted one person one person to come up to me and say ""you did good John.
"" And mean it.
After all that.
What did you want?
I never wanted that stuff.
Plus what else?
Those men are all dead.
This your stuff?
Christ look at you.
Am I out of here?
I could take it or leave it.
It's just dinner.
Listen you still have to eat.
I have to get home...
You know let me tell you something!
I'm not that kind of person.
So we're not all...
You do the best you can with what you got.
I'm paying you.
That's not true...
We're having a lovely conversation.
""So have you met anyone?
I only thank God I moved out.
I never really...
went through a...
I mean it's not easy in this day and age.
Well there's nobody special!
It's not so...
Do I look like I have someone special?
anybody special in your life?
It's an awful thing let me tell you.
So he says to me ""you'll never find another man like me""...
That all depends on you.
Can I get you anything...
I do them myself.
Where did you get them done?
They'll be in soon.
You know I think I...
But now it's free right?
Right on it!
Most men are.
why a man would have to be out of his mind!
And you have a lovely home.
seeing lots of men...
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
What did I get?
We both got something out of it all right!
What have you been doing here!
I just said all I want is some time.
So what time do you need?
Have I ever...
Right now I'm just not sure about...
Where have I been?
You want to talk?
I think we should talk about this.
I love this!
There's coffee if you want...
He says if I want to get back to work no problem.
He wants me to come in and talk and...
You did a real nice thing for somebody else.
Nothing it's just...
Who's knows.
You think it'll work out?
I think they're made for each other.
We thought we'd get some dinner.
Would you like to come along?
What are you two up to?
Well talk back.
He just needs some clothes?
Although some women go for that.
And this is our other..
if I can help him in some way...
It's a stupid idea.
Well what the hell does that mean?
See I told you!
And I thought if I could get them together I...
I was not with a woman last night.
two people out sick.
Ya think I need this?
I Do Not Need This!
I want to speak to...
stay out all night long...
I'll be off in a second.
I wish there was some way I could...
pay the fine and go home.
Things will change.
Like it really works ya know...
You have a little...
something on your face...
You still believe in God?
I'm not seeing anyone else.
before you go on...
We've had a wonderful time together...
You're all right...
No I'm fine...
Should I call a doctor!
Did you call the police...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
All night long.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.
Ya know you used to like that about me.
That we could be together and not think...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Well it's funny!
take the day off.
Is this one of those days when you're in...
He needs hospital care.
There's really nothing you can do.
How could that happen?
I'm afraid not...
Then again I'm not sure.
It seems he's..
There's no way to tell.
He was brought in once before I understand...
She said for me to call!
But I think we'll go out this weekend...
I met this beautiful girl...
Yeah I know the place.
went to this bar...
this very ya know -- hard-to-get-in place...
what have you got for us?
He and his wife was were at some bar..
She was a beautiful girl...
She never knew what hit her.
I let him stay there.
He is supposed to live there?
I've been to hell and back....
that kind of thing...
It used to be what I absolutely lived for...
what does all of this really mean?
That and the fact that all my friends are dead...
Can you tell me something?
maybe we can...
where do you want to go?
A real nice place I know...
Just let me go...
Come on now...
It's not fair...
No I have to work.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
I'll say no.
You know tomorrow's a very big day for me...
You can ask.
How's tonight?
When can you...
Well since you're a member we could...
They're free.
So how do we do this?
For a short time until you get your own.
See if you're interested.
This has never...
I've never won anything and...
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Your name was picked.
that's all right...
I thought I knew her...
God I have no idea.
She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Hey they're moving....
Am I doing that?
Nothing bad will happen.
I feel so much for her...
What are the other reasons?
But that's not the only reason people get together or..
Where did you two meet?
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Well see I think she can help...
You know women are great..
and in this state of...
Life for him lost it's reason.
His only hope he thought was death.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
I mean it...
Come on try it.
This is New York!
I think that's very fair.
Well that's stupid.
Well maybe he wants to stay here.
do you want to stay here?
Someone will take care of him.
not what they used to be.
WHO'S RUNNING?!!
CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
He's gone now but we had him on the run!
He knows who you are!
He's afraid!
I can tell!
WILL YOU PLEASE...
please listen to me...
There's a part of you that                         Come on...
I know who you are...
I know who you are..
or who you were.
you're a teacher...
That's why the Little People sent you.
Will you shut-up!!!
I LOVE THIS MAN...
You are such a great guy.
First the money now this.
Now I know why you're saying this.
You could get a job...
let me explain this one more time...
This man has done nothing.
You really want to help me?
But I gave it to you...
to help YOU...
But I gave it to you!
Give that back!
I have to get back to work.
Can I take you to lunch?
no it's..
This is so nice of you...
Here's another twenty.
I just would like to help you.
you could use some money.
Do you follow her every day?
Give my love to the wife and kids.
That's why you're the one...
You can get it...
I think you're a very nice...
And I'm not The One...
They work for Him.
I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...
I've got a right to say something.
They say you're not ready to know.
I'm the one what?
They said you're The One.
The Little People?
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
They're --  -- What?
Have I died?
I'm in hell.
I know a great place.
Go for it!
Tell the man what he's won!
Ha ha ha ha rubbish...
You know there's enough in here for the two of you.
It's not just from tonight.
I've known you for a long time.
I see you come out of work every day.
I walk with you to lunch.
I know what you order...
and I love you.
But I'll be back in the morning.
And I will call if you let me...
Will you stop!...
I'm in love with you...
Oh no I want to.
want just one night.
So are you but I think maybe you should shut up now...
That was never my idea.
Listen you're very nice...
Well no wonder.
Why am I putting myself through this?
It was very nice...
and we'll...
you'll just have some coffee maybe...
you're walking me home.
What are we about to do?
I never say anything I have to.
Well it's enough for me.
I want to know everything.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Well we have plenty of those.
I just wish I had more time...
I leave it to you.
See I told you it was him...
What the hell are they doing?!
You got any change?
No let's go...
I have to see how things are first.
My father's sick you understand?
Give me one good reason.
I wish I'd known...
Well is that a happy face I see?
Is what you?
Just one minute you!
You'll be gone period.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
Be a good girl.
We can still have a good time.
I hope they do.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
Give me some form...
Is it my turn again?
That's right hand.
I'll go out with you or I'll stay here and do anything you'd like for me to do...
if you'll just do one thing.
If you'll tell me that you love me.
You're playing the other side.
People that's who!
I had to leave this place.
I saw a picture of it.
Look at my car!
Piece of shit!
Okay I'll make it as easy for you as I can.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Wait I've made up my mind.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
I know what it comes with but that's not what I want.
Five'll do it.
Can I get you anything else?
I always tell everyone the same thing.
They still have some left I believe.
Are you talking to us?
But what about me?
It's none of your business!
Where is she anyway?
Yeah well he's...
He does walk funny.
Why are you being so mean?
Well if you just maybe did something with your hair or...
If you just did a little more with yourself...
The way I look?
You should've left a long time ago.
I mean you think I'm that happy?
A couple of months.
Yeah me too...
No I need to talk to you about so many things...
Maybe you better stay then.
I better let you...
I'd rather drive up myself and...
He's not...
They feel he...
Oh well what what's he...
You always do this to me.
I hope it will yes.
That'll make you happy.
I mean what would it come to?
I mean why should he ask for it?
Just give me a chance will you?
Please I'll see you later this evening.
You have to tell me that.
I have to tell you that.
Will you let me talk to you please?
No I want to talk to you now.
I have to explain something about...
I'll be back later...
Of course I'd like to.
Yeah I think I could.
He really did.
That's what you said?
Yes that's what's important to me...
Serious that's what's important to you?
I'd like you to leave now.
I think it's what you think.
No you're very good at it.
I was really very moved by the way you...
It's music.
I have played a few times.
I gave it a second thought.
Yeah I'll probably be free.
If you're free.
The day after tomorrow.
Tomorrow's a full practice day...
But the day after is kind of open.
Then after that?
Let me give it some thought.
Have you anything to suggest?
but I feel silly telling you.
This is really your home.
You probably know better than I what there is to do.
What would I do with it?
What have I been doing?
Different things different jobs here and there.
Nothing that interesting.
What have you been doing since then?
You're all full of shit!
There's nothing wrong with the way I walk.
Now where are we?
I'm not aware of it.
No the last time was three years ago.
Four or five years.
All I got left is what I have on...
Will you shut up for a minute!!
Pull your car out of line.
Well thank you that's a very nice thing for you to say.
There's more than enough room here.
Can you imagine?
Simple as that...
Oh no it's been much more than that.
Well I should hope not...
And what about love?
Hold onto this.
They know the best places to stop.
But do you know, they will not even let us have it.
And they picked up!
Well, you're not that bad, but some people...
Well she was.
There's some good things on it, sometimes.
There's some good things on it, though.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
If you want to call it that.
I told you, no.
I'm not that type.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
Not now, I'm busy
I look good, that's it.
So what else do you do for these girls?
You look good.
So what you think of me?
A play-ya.
I got a lot, more than one.
So what's her name?
So you got a girl?
What you do today?
You know somebody around here?
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
What you want with her anyway'
I think by Twenty-two.
Or over by Boy's Club?
What you want with her anyway?
You in love with her?
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
So what girls are over there?
Tell me which one you would like.
Be straight up!
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
How does he look up close?
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
Yo, that's my girl.
You here to see somebody?
You looking for somebody?
One of the many.
So what do you want with her anyway?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Until then, get the hell out of my face.
You mean her.
Would you like me to change anything?
Hey, what are you doing?
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
So where does it come from?
Make my evening.
Thank God, the police.
But next time...
Thanks for coming down to see us.
That a boy.
Its been very nice meeting you.
Can I ask anybody now?
My God, you're serious.
but we have.
We're looking at five years, maybe ten.
Is that what you want...
Why are you doing this Mr.
And what do you do for a living, Mr.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place.
So what's your name?
I said I'll take care of it.
So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Maybe I'll come back with a date.
I hope they still fit.
Honest, I feel fine.
Is she ever.
Well, which one?
Still, it'd an odd name.
But not right next to each other.
I thought that's what you meant.
That's my club too.
Know how he gets it in the country?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office.
And you can help or --
No, not for sure.
When it comes, it comes.
No idea at all?
So what do you figure?
This was last month.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Here you are, Doctor.
Yes, right away.
Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Are you all right, Doctor?
They're still there.
What have they done with this place?
Hey, shut up, okay?
I just hate this.
How similar in build you and I are.
And what was that?
I'd have been long gone.
Read this, please.
Course he has.
That's his wife.
Then he has.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Ten days ago?
Oh, about ten days ago.
Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Can I ask you a few questions?
Not mine, stupid.
You sure did.
I think it might take you a while to get your life back together.
You wait here for them.
What do you say, Mr.
You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
You sure got the hard part.
I'll take care of everything else.
Take it where?
I will be here in the room, waiting for you.
I have the same problem with my help.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting.
It's the staff's night off.
These will be open.
I've thought.
So why pick me?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me.
And I have a wife.
They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month.
well, I'd rather not be around for it.
One thousand, just to listen.
I want you to come to my house.
Then we'll talk.
He's about to leave the country with her.
Nothing to it.
That's one thing I did find.
But I did ---
I wonder if that's his doctor.
You doing a story on this guy?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
' I'll be down in a minute.
I need it right away.
Did you hear something?
No, thank you.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more.
Let me show you some.
You've met her?
I want to hear this.
I'll know tomorrow.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
What is this....
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I think you better sit down.
If you need me, call the paper.
I was afraid you'd say that.
What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I'll take you to a game.
I've got to go to Mr.
Just give me twenty-four hours.
All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me.
What does all this mean?
He's a bad guy, Mrs.
I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
I'll cover it.
Thanks for the great time.
What about his parents?
Oh, listen to me.
I've never even been there and look what I say about it.
Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do.
Thanks, I feel much better.
Why'd you let me in?
' I mean, ask me something else.
Depends on the question.
I got him out.
You were in the war?
Here, take mine.
I mean put clothes on.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I really should change.
It's John.
None of your business, now go away.
I bet you do.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I must be having an off day.
Why do you keep doing this?
Oh, personal stuff.
I hit one!
What are you asking me for?
So were my parents.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful name, really.
Your call is come through.
No thanks, I'll do it.
You want I set up?
Very good, sir.
I'd better only get two.
I would, actually.
She told me to meet her there.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting?
They just left, sir.
What did you want under the bed?
We had so much to talk about.
So you're saying she moved out.
She moved out.
She moved out?
I was supposed to meet Mrs.
He told me to watch out for the place.
I'm sick of this place.
They need a power forward.
You'll have it.
I need a story from you by tomorrow.
How could you call him?
Come on, say yes.
I have some ideas.
You're onto something.
I think I'm really on to something here.
He's not the story!
So let's go!
I never read the paper.
No it's not okay.
You have to have this in by tomorrow.
Something came up, okay?
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Can you give it to me real quick?
In a minute!
Can you give me a minute?
I'm a new member.
Thanks, I needed that.
What cheap shit...
But I am...
you were right last night.
Did she tell you anything?
Did she have it?
I'll buy you a new one.
I found her.
No one knew him like I did...
Question one:  Can I have some money?
Of course I want off the case.
My God, Mr.
Find the girl.
I have some questions.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
I carry my own.
But how did you know?
Here, take this picture...
I need you to find my little sister.
And the house.
What are you looking at...
It's a beautiful thing.
The music kind.
What do they make?
But it's not necessary.
People are dead.
One was a friend.
This one is putting out low bits.
You're not funny.
What were your words...
Get that music off!
What are you doing at the office?
She wants to meet.
Way down-town.
Forget it, man.
What do you say we...
You did good work...
I mean, she is what this case is about.
How'd you get this from her?
Could be interesting.
I'll process her.
None with a police record, though.
So what about this watch?
That's for me...
I love you, too, baby.
He wants to meet at six.
What time is it now?
Car insurance costs money.
You're saying you need money.
I do it for love.
Three hundred coming right up.
You gave it to the girls for one.
There's that question...
I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
This must be hell.
People still watch that?
Let's watch some 'M.
Here's our stop...
Jesus, tell me!
Who would want him dead?
I'm so sure!
You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.
Why are all these people after me?
Let's get serious...
This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay.
he's real busy.
Who's my real father, man?
Good news is that yeah, I found him.
Yeah, go on...
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
So, did you find my dad?
Have you even looked?
I tried to help you...!
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?
Well, I tried.
There were two of them you know...
I did what you would have done.
To find my father.
I got a case.
I'm talking to my friend.
Why am I what?
Why you always fucking with me?
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
Why do you hate me?
What are you running from?
Let me go out like a man.
Tonight was different.
I felt love.
Oh, but I am.
You should try it.
I'm off it!
What's fine?
Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead.
I'm running a little late.
A last drink?
, now did I?
You really should get a watch.
It's a three piece set here!
Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
Go on, another time, another place.
His record sales have gone way up.
I knew your father.
He was quite...
Why thank you.
It's a Christmas present.
Good to meet you, Mr.
It is to us!
You're funny.
Only on a first name basis.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
There's four thousand here.
Just find her, man.
Do whatever you want with my words.
And my money.
They are very hard to walk around in.
I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.
What's my name?
Coming in this week, week after.
There's only some talk.
There's nothing around.
How come there's nothing out there?
That stuff is all milk.
Everything is everything.
Well try, okay?
It's worth more money to you.
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.
The police know you brought the car into the country.
Did they follow you?
Did you pick up the car?
It's yours too!
It's your problem.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Who's this --
Are you sure it is dead?
We'll be out of the country Friday.
There'll be someone else.
He is not wrong.
He's not strong enough.
But will they?
We must follow it.
Our American friends.
With no support in the middle.
I got no music!
You're for real?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.
You're in show business.
I'm in show business.
What's your story?
Where's he from?
And a Mr.
There may be two...
no, three who could fit it.
There's nobody like that on six.
There's a man in almost every one of them.
He got off on six.
When ya go back on?
I come by to help you carry out your money.
One end to the other.
Who's on him?
Third time around.
This is my case.
We put him to bed for the night.
Also he made me.
You want the red or the white?
Let yourself in.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Check the bread.
You make him?
Who is that guy?
Hey I thought we come for a drink.
Come on -- one drink.
What is that old building?
Darling may I have this one?
You'll never be sorry.
She mean anything?
She means something to me!
What is that?!
Get those away from me!
What I know is what I told you.
But you got lucky right?
You got away with something else.
Well I think you do.
That was over thirty years ago.
I paid for that and then some.
Wish I was.
One way to find out.
It looks open on the other side.
This is what we do.
The future guy?
I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
I'll be upstairs...
if you want to play.
but not now...
in the future.
on the radio.
I've been talking to this...
Something I need to tell you about.
Do you know how much I love you?
I love you more.
What would you do without me?
long as you get there.
Come get me.
Go watch the game?
Go watch the fucking game?
You understand what that means?
You're in a world of shit.
Something I can believe.
And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Forget the radio.
Do you know where I found this?
Let's go outside and talk.
We need to do that.
John hold on a second.
I'm in the middle of something important here.
You mind if...
Okay I'm on it.
Lucky throw fire boy.
You got it you got it!
I'm right here behind you...
No but we can.
We did it John.
We stopped him.
I'm here Dad.
John you there?
Just a minute John...
Dad you there?
You off today?
Use a pay phone.
What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Please Dad just do it.
We got him!
Dad you got him!
I need you to believe in me.
To believe that we can do this.
But we can we can do it together.
So all we can do is deal with this...
and try to make it right.
This is wrong...
we did this.
We changed everything.
in the fire.
no matter what.
Yeah I think so...
I'm right here Dad.
John you still there?
John say hello to my wife...
Well game five was the big one.
They pull it off?
We're okay...
we're good Dad.
What are we like in...
What else John.
All right I'm with you.
I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Which means he probably knew her.
This is working.
I just kept talking to her.
Do you know who he is?
What do I tell them?
They'll question her.
Whatever they tell her could change what happens.
No I want you to follow her.
The one's left behind?
But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.
But somewhere they know.
this is different.
You can make that happen Dad.
So what should I do?
You think they'll believe me?
That'll never work.
What about the other women?
Something we did changed the case...
seven more women.
Dad we did something.
Something to make it worse.
There was this case.
ten days from now.
No Dad it happened a long time ago a long time ago for me.
She just died your mother just died?
It's like it just happened.
Something happened something...
Are you alright""?
Sorry I lost you last night.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Something happened today.
Times we never had before.
We're doing all right Dad.
We're doing good.
But that's tomorrow.
On the job?
I never knew you Dad.
I lost you.
But you're not...
you're not still here.
I'm trying to be Dad.
I missed you...
I'm not doing anything.
This is wrong.
That would make it...
there was something on the news.
How could this be happening?
What if it's not...
What'd you say your station...
and I'm asking how you called the game.
What'd you say your name was?
What'd you just say?
I'm talking about this afternoon.
Game happened almost thirty years ago.
How the hell did you do it?
I'm right with you man.
Name's John.
John you all right?
Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
It's tomorrow.
Go in where?
I'll come over.
I talked to my Dad.
What the hell!
if you can find it.
Not the first time that's been true.
got a hit.
This case just got hot.
That means she was the first.
Our lucky break.
A lucky break.
What're you talking'?
You know better than anybody John.
I remember this case.
She makes ten.
This is getting real old John.
I talked to him it was real.
You're not looking too good.
She made up her mind.
But she knew John.
A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
She's pretty special.
Hey future boy.
You work too hard John.
I wish you'd gone.
So how are things at the hospital?
I'm sure everything'll work out.
Probably at work.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
If you give up that right...
forget about it.
I hear that.
What house you work?
Yeah long time ago.
I know you?
You used to be on the job?
In my heart.
Buy you a cup of coffee?
Thought I'd say ""hello.
Look at this all of you!
I found this today.
Actually I have no idea what the World's Record is.
One thousand twelve...
one thousand thirteen...
one thousand fourteen...
What's the World's Record for this?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.
Would you be yourself...
if you looked this this?
most of the time.
can you hear me?
That was the best yet.
Was it you...
Think you can figure it out?
First we take off our clothes then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Be a man man.
That's the way it is man.
I love you man!
Come on down!
It's the last house on the left.
It's all right you're all right.
I'm with you.
My parents were waiting up for me.
That was the first time she'd ever hit me.
I turned around and...
No one would tell me anything.
All I know is what the police told me.
I'm really trying.
How do I break through?
And what about us?
Why did you come back here?
You can never be sure of what's out there.
You know I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.
I can look around by myself.
I'll take the upstairs.
Somebody was in here.
I got here just before you did.
Did you stay here last night?
Look what I found.
There's time.
Let me get to know you again.
Let me get to know this place again.
I lose control.
Is that so bad?
Always so sure of yourself.
Even when we were kids when you wanted something nothing could stop you.
You can say...
""Hello how are you?
You know what I've been through.
I never said you were ""nothing"".
I just want you to like me.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.
I like you...
I was thinking that maybe.
Look at it this way...
things can only get better...
No time to explain.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Got any good ideas?
Stick around and you'll see.
In that little thing?
My whole world.
Now stop it.
He'll get out of our way.
He'll move.
It's hard enough to read this thing.
I wish it was.
Is that all you found?
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Nobody's seen him.
The game's over!!
Now wait a second!
Never should've let her play.
This is a man's game.
No, it's not...
I'll be back as soon as I can.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
And I said, shut up!
You stay put.
But, Dad, we...
Come on, Dad.
They did show up.
I thank you for getting me out.
Okay, give it back.
What's it to ya?
There's one.
You tell me what you need...
I'll make sure you get in.
Then we can get the hell out of here.
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...
He has to be stopped.
Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.
I found it outside.
No, he was real.
He was after me.
He called somebody then took off.
Yeah we're here.
Everything's all right now.
They should've paid their bill.
You got me where you want me.
There's no reason not...
We're taking care of it.
You kids better leave.
This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
-- yeah yeah yeah.
-- look just shut up.
Let's cut through the shit.
Well let's hope not!
Come by my house tonight at eleven.
So let's talk.
but there just may not be enough time.
If you still care about her if you still want to try to make things better between you two...
we should talk.
That's it we're done.
You need to leave.
You know why I need you.
Name your price.
Everyone has a price what's yours?
You food'll be right out.
You know he's not...
and he's coming for you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Okay I'll call you later.
Do you have to ask?
Not so bad today.
Good night beautiful.
Everything'll work out.
So's he and he knows it.
For a good reason.
Why did you want her body?
Take him to my car.
You're talking about my lady.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Sit down a second.
Does he know about what happened?
She's yours?
Sorry I'm working now.
You see I have a job...
Take these off!
I'll send her right over.
It was a community service.
that's really lovely.
No -- she left me!
You call what you did bad?!
Not after what you did to her.
She asked me to come over.
She said she had something to tell me.
Then why were you at her house?!
I know what it sounds like.
How many times do you want to hear this?
He had to be dead...
Oh my dear God...
I mean really never.
But she might be in trouble...
wait a minute!
I think I'll pass.
See you later okay?
It's not that it's just that...
He bought you that?
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...
especially with this.
And I'll never do it again.
And you'll never do it again.
Ask me in about five minutes.
how do you feel?
Not another word do you hear me??
Just for us.
They're out of town.
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Use some common sense!
Enough is enough.
Has he brought it back on course yet?
What are you doing??
Oh dear God...
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
Oh I can see that.
Take it easy...
No I think it's just the beginning.
She needs to live.
You have no right...
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I'm a little concerned.
You can and you will!
Oh he is indeed.
He is not.
What a beautiful day.
You can and you will!!
Whatever you've been...
I'm the one you should be listening to!
Why are you doing this to yourself?
It's not too late to put you back on land.
It was just a normal summer.
I've never been able to figure it out.
About four years ago...
When did this start?
But you're not telling me everything are you?
In other words level with me.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
what's it about?
You let me worry about him okay?
You made the right decision.
I've got the numbers.
they've been...
they're dead.
You have to call the police...
what'd they do to you??
I'm not!!
We'll be okay.
Just radio for help okay???
What do you mean???
we've gone off course or something...
If I go with you he'll never speak to me again.
so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Can he really take us home?
I said to him get off from here.
Very bad today.
Had to be him.
About an hour and a half ago.
I saw her come out of a place.
Not that we really mean it.
But where does he live?
There are things that speak to us from the past.
'  I'm telling you as a friend.
He'll hate it.
We're making too much of this.
I gave it away.
The man has taken over my mind.
He's not only out there.
You say we go?
I say we go.
Do we care?
I said `I'm dead'.
A year and a half later?
And he was there?
What happened eighteen months ago?
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
You used to love life.
I can tell you the year the day the night the minute.
I'm trying to think.
When did you start looking so terrible?
You put your hands on her personal parts?
Tell me how bad you feel.
We're suppose to feel bad together.
This is what friends do.
That sounds so final.
It's over finished and done with.
Small but important.
I was thinking about you.
You're not making sense.
Of course I saw it.
What are we talking about?
Nothing personal friend.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
He will absolutely hate it.
They'll lose tonight.
Then they'll lose tomorrow.
I used to tell myself.
In and out of bed.
It's so different from anything you've done.
Can he get through it?
You know about Peter of course.
I talked to her two days ago.
Second time he's done that.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
What will we talk about?
I'll see you all the time.
But you're only eighteen.
We can still turn it around.
Can we talk later?
Will you be at the party?
I have a class.
Take it yourself.
Take a date.
But I just need one.
Believe me I know this.
That's right nineteen years.
And what about the days and minutes?
She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name.
Do you think that's too much to ask?
For a wife of nineteen years.
Why do you need a radio?
I'm seeing your play tonight remember?
What do you want to talk about?
I'll talk about anything.
And this is not what we should be talking about.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I go to college.
I thought you knew.
Where are you all day?
He made us wait and wait.
I've seen it twice.
I went back tonight to be sure.
What do we want?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before you know I can feel completely free to be myself.
First you tell me.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
It's only our first date.
We did it in the office.
She's you know a woman.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
Be open with me.
Let's be open with each other.
That's very lovely actually.
I wanted to see what you saw.
That's always been my problem.
You understand me.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Two-all after six.
Your father said you might be here.
Life is real.
Life is true.
This could be it!
A thousand things.
One more out.
Life is good.
Until they lose.
Show him who we are.
And that's us.
Who we were and where we come from.
I like coming back.
I think the building's okay.
I'll go get you another one.
You have to wear it.
I lose everything.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
Let's not start that again.
Since when did that matter?
But I especially want you to see this play.
And for you too.
I have to know what you think.
You'll need these.
For the play.
It's one life.
They go to a ball game together.
Thirty-five years later they sit in the kitchen and remember.
It's one thing for kids.
Then they lost on Sunday.
We'll watch them lose.
I do know the answer to that.
Five's not so many.
Get yourself something to eat.
How did we do it?
But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years.
If it's you what are you doing here?
Go get them.
I'm at the door.
It's a test all right.
All the awful things I said to my mother and father.
Speak it like it's real.
Say it and you'll believe it.
What does that tell me?
You want to make the night come down.
I want to believe.
Believe in them.
You want to lose.
It's too hard for you to believe in something.
It may be work but it's not honest work.
Your problem is you take the easy way out.
It's a simple subject.
You want to lose control.
Jesus knows it.
It's a whole life.
Go on tell him.
Children see this.
He asked me a question.
That's a simple subject.
Everybody else does.
I'm looking at you trying to think.
What about my play?
I've done it too many times.
There was no game last night.
They're my team too.
All by myself.
`Look over here.
They're not your team.
They're my team.
If they lost tonight they'll lose tomorrow.
Why does it matter?
Then they lost?
We have every right.
So what happened since?
She said she told you about Peter.
I'll think of your name in just a --
Get the hell out of here.
I know it sounds easy.
I can see her face so clearly.
You have to see the words.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I know you both.
That's so what.
No one's waiting.
Someone waiting for you?
Do you think he can do it?
But you're his friend.
Is what true?
Would you like to meet him?
I hear good things about the new play.
Here I am world.
He has -- something.
A funny little quality I find --
I think I remember.
I was in the fish-market play.
What's good?
And I thought at last she's here she wants me.
One past and one future.
Why do you think I live this way?
But you're here.
So you must have come to me.
You've come to me.
I wanted to believe you would one day.
There's no room!
And the air is lovely.
I am your wife.
Everyone takes his turn.
Here you see?
They are boys.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
"" I thought it meant father.
If I want to be one with them I have to live like them.
Well we shall try.
I thought you were a man of God.
That was lucky.
and -- and when I read what you've been doing here I -- I wanted to help.
Some of it good I hope.
I -- I mean it's all right.
I thought you'd be bigger.
Lots of hair...
long time ago.
and I knew something had to give.
No no -- just a moment please.
A -- a week.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
The only question is when  and how.
Wait and see...
wait and see...
He's waiting.
Maybe I'm wrong...
maybe we're not ready yet.
all of the Congress...
My name is Walk-er.
You've done me a great service.
I've come here to think about it.
Even as a boy I thought so.
The word only means ""community.
"" But it could stand for ""village""...
or the world.
I know you are right.
They understand -- they really do.
It's not the workers you have to worry about.
We must stop.
The country would stop.
There is nothing I can give.
We need your help!
I am beginning to know Mr.
-- he may amount to something.
Who is that young man?
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.
We are children of God like everyone else.
That was England.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Of course it is not quite that simple.
Perhaps some tea?
Yes sir he has.
And it still goes on.
Could we cut all news off?
Have you found him?
If you did this no one could control it.
Too late for that.
We're too far out.
Now is your chance to find out.
How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
But <i>you</i> did once.
It's for the best.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You've gone as far as you can go.
I'm sorry there's no way we can.
It would be five thousand more.
How much extra?
I like football.
You want to give your child the best possible start.
And keep in mind this child is still you simply the <i>best</i> of you.
You'll give us a bad name.
Not yet I'm afraid.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
he <i>is</i> here.
We test again.
Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.
From what budget?
From outside if you have to.
No we've missed something.
They know who works there.
That's why he did it.
The West side.
Do you need any more than that?
--There's that word again.
We're in the wrong place.
--I've already run it.
Not <i>likely</i>.
No <i>this</i> is your man.
Of course Sir.
We have to be certain.
Surely you know what you have.
You have more in common than you know.
These are just the clothes.
He has to wear them.
Something I could never do.
I've been looking for him.
Do you know where he is?
Now <i>you're</i> here.
Who are your ""friends""?
My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
I got the better end of the deal.
In case you get back before I do.
Why have you done this?
No but you might need them when you get back.
I could always walk.
How the hell did you get here.
I was never very good at it remember?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away.
To be honest I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
Everybody goes there.
Where are you taking her?
I have to act like nothing's wrong.
But she's have to know eventually.
You're not thinking of telling her are you?
If I were you I'd worry about myself.
Never stopped you before.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
You're the one who said not to change anything.
I'm sure I could have.
No we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.
I've put too much into this.
Less than a week to go.
Not on your life--
Come on--we're taking off.
What makes them think that?
--I walked right in front of it.
A day or so.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
What <i>is</i> that one?
Hey how much of you can be there?
Listen I bag this stuff anyway.
Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
It's not too late to back out.
<i>More</i> than that.
You really need that much?
It needs work.
It's not easy living up to this.
I have to know where you come from.
What will happen to the others?
That's already been taken care of.
you know to play with.
Have you given it any thought?
There's a way.
I hope he's not just a body.
I've found him.
I've found him too.
I've found him!
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
A year is a long time.
We could go together one day.
--when you go away.
I left it back there.
Let's walk.
You've never been here?
Let me order for you.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Of course I think about it every day.
What exactly is wrong?
You'll be next.
<i>yes</i>...
Does it have a name?
Have they found our friend?
We were just looking.
I was at home.
What about <i>you?
</i>  Where were you last night?
But then who know what he could do.
I've got enough here.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
If everything goes to plan this could be the last time I see you for a while.
One week to go.
Only every time I'm in here.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
You can have other children.
I'm not doing it.
The doctor will give you something.
Get it over with...
But we are both not interested in that right now.
to cover for you.
A little more was taken out before.
We only got a half a million.
What do you add up to here?
I always do my own work.
You know you and I may be two of a kind.
What about your wife?
And you got him...
I'll take care of my end.
They will be ready.
I heard about you.
They stay out of it.
You run the job but I run the show.
You got two weeks to set it up.
I get my own help.
You're back with your own people now.
This is the only time you and I meet in public.
Yeah why not?
but we sure gave it a run.
How long before this car's hot?
Just get your clothes on...
If they are not here he must have sent them away.
He's always got his family around...
You'll feel okay.
We've got some food coming should be here any minute.
That's all I want...
It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
You want to try with me?
Whatever happens it's over.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here.
We got to go one way or another.
We've come a lot of miles.
But we're not close to anything.
We got this far.
If we ever get out of here maybe I should take off...
Look what you said yesterday...
It's hard enough.
I want to say something.
We better stick here till tonight.
Do what I tell you it's not a game.
Twenty eight hundred.
Only one car.
The word's on every bill!!!
you would have.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
That would be the first time.
Why there's nothing on the news?
there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
When they find it they find it.
What about when they find the body on the train?
I'll cut the money with you.
When we had trouble before it was different.
I can always get you out...
There better be a guy with the
How long ago.
You sent me to him.
Do it my way.
I've never ""been there...
When we met it was in his office.
I've got to give him his money.
That was our end of the deal.
There are three men dead.
I see it...
What about the bank?
But it is different.
It's different.
We'll be all right tomorrow.
Waiting's hard.
You never learn how.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You know how I feel?
Should be light traffic that time of day...
Usually on the right side as you go in.
I had a lot of that.
I had a lot of that too.
But I got you out.
I got you out.
Is he straight?
Yeah well I think I'll stick with what I've got.
I bought you a lot of new things.
give me a minute.
We've got time.
We've got a lot of time.
It's just been a while.
Now I can.
After four years and now the question comes up.
You go out much?
That's not all of it.
some things never change.
You been okay?
What do you want for dinner?
I'll never make another one.
Better than old times.
Just like old times?
Where did you get those?
Small town small bank big money.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
You've never been there.
I want to take a walk.
It looks fine.
I'm sorry I was late...
I got my hair done...
You want to drive?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
I've got to get out now.
I hope yours is okay too.
No I'm afraid not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
One thing though...
how do I explain this to my wife?
Hope you do too.
Might try that.
It's just a walk-in bank.
I'll hang on to these.
You're back up all the way...
I'm good at that.
I got out.
You were with him?
Then you do it.
He took the day off.
Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Go with God.
Well I paid a hell of a price.
I can afford it you know.
How about twenty thousand?
how much money did you make this year?
You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow...
They got to be looked after...
One more thing...
If anybody but you comes back...
tell us what you want.
Is it possible Mrs.
I'll tell you when.
I've got to stop.
we've got all this.
You'll feel better then...
Yes but listen.
You knew what I'd do.
He'd seen the film.
A couple of weeks back.
When did you find out?
He's got his ways.
How'd it happen then?
What happened to this car?
It was the only way I could get at them.
That's all I was told.
Your brother's name was mentioned.
Next day he was dead.
I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back  You know my life.
Looks after itself.
People put money in.
I take it out.
It's a business that makes me very happy.
So far as I'm concerned that's it.
Trouble is if I try and they find out I'm dead.
With me it's a full- time job.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
You know what the bloody time is!
Where's he living these days?
Who paid you to see me off?
That's very kind of somebody.
Who do I have to thank?
What happens if I miss the train?
Train goes at four minutes past twelve.
You've just got time.
You stay in the car.
I'll come and listen.
That was on Sunday.
Look I'm me right.
We are what we are like it or not.
Once a week?
He was all right to me.
Tomorrow morning then?
I want to talk to you later.
It's not like that.
I've got a husband you know.
She's nothing to do with me.
That's my name  And her father was my brother.
What you talking about?
Who set it up?
The young girl.
Tell me about the girl.
You've been watching the film.
Now you're asking.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
He thinks I'm simple.
Is he coming here?
We're there now.
Oh he was.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Very lucky I should think.
How'd you know where I'd be?
He was here for four days.
While he was here.
You went about together?
Yes while he was here.
We went about together.
When he came up on business.
I met him last year.
No do you really?
I know him too.
I work for him.
I'll be off now.
I should be at work.
A bloody funny thing!
It's a bloody funny thing.
then he goes and does a thing like that.
Nice of you to come.
Go and get your hair done.
Nice family are they?
At me friend's house.
You all right now?
That must be interesting.
Oh what you doing now?
I left last year.
Sorry about your father.
You knew they'd come back.
What happened to you then?
Join the tea set.
Four of them.
They were waiting for us in the car park.
Where you off to?
Said he'd heard you were up in town.
Wanted to look you up.
That's what he was saying about you.
Went to school with him.
He always goes.
Where would I find him?
Nobody seems to know.
It just would.
He was always the same.
Why would it?
Hell we worked together every day for a year.
I mean what for?
He was always on time.
How could I stay away?
You coming back?
And that'll make me feel better?
They're friends of mine.
No chance of that.
So shut up.
Pension him off.
That little shit!
What'll they do to him?
They came back?
Now just a minute...
Let's be having it.
It's my house you know.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you.
I might even let you watch.
The door on the right.
Why should I give house- room to your sort?
And who's he?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
It'll cost you.
Can I phone London?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
You're the first since Monday.
I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Will this do?
I've bloody finished you.
So it's all girls together is it?
You should have told me who you were working for.
They're still the same.
Making a living.
You're making good.
What's it to you anyway?
Oh you've been watching television.
Oh I'm straight.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.
A death in the family.
If they were still living.
So what're you doing?
What you doing around here then?
Things to see to.
Do you know I never knew he worked in one of my places!
I really could.
We've got to take you back to London.
They do that up North.
You're not seeing me?
Your hundred and another hundred.
That's what you pay to find out.

The deal's dead.
Am I talking about the deal?
I want to tell you something.
Your life is your own.
You have a contract with your wife.

Those things are yours.
This is your life.
She told me not to talk to you.
What Jim: I tell you what let's get out of here...

Wednesday Thursday Friday.
Three business days.
They mean three business days.
But we have to before Monday.
Jim Jim you saw my book...
Of course you have three days.
They said we have three days.
Why did she do that Jim?
Who did she call?

One thinks twice...

I'll take you to lunch where would you like to go?
I've got to talk to you...
I've got to talk to you.
It might mean nothing to you...
and it might not.
Well let's have a couple more.
All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.
How are they different?
What's special...
We're all different.
We're not the same.
We are not the same.
What I'm saying what is our life?
It's looking forward or it's looking back.
And that's our life.
Where is the moment?
And what is it that we're afraid of?
what of these happen...?
None on 'em.
We worry anyway.
How can we act?
What do I...?
But it's only food.
What do you remember about them?
You know how long it took me to get there?
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.
You did it live with it.
If you think there is then be that thing.
Bad people go to hell?
If you think that act that way.
Is that what I did?
You want to...
Bring that shit up.
And you'd be right.
They took 'em...
You just this morning...
You hear what I said?
I GET HIS ACTION.
My stuff is mine whatever he gets for himself I'm talking half.
You put me in with him.
Your contract went out to the bank.
Your contract went out.
It was nothing...
The police  can be...
You know your business, I know mine.
What's the fucking point in any case...?
What's the point.
Give 'em to me...
you want to go out today...?
I have the stuff from last year's...
what do you fucking...?
It went down.
Some of them...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They got listen to me...
Well that's alright...
I never finished college.
Of course there was a war then.
Some day you will.
To do business.
Just a few days.
How long will you be gone?
No where is it?
Did you see my present for you?
Did you like your party?
Oh yes the very best.
He would give it away.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Then after that what?
You know his friends...
We'll have to pay.
Three hundred are we agreed?
I think he would.
You go see your children first and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
Well thank you they asked for you all week.
But I understand you now; I think I do.
The children can stay.
I want to talk to you Michael.
You have a house here with us.
You can live here with your kids...
He'll understand.
Then why do you come to me?
You're not my father!
I saw him with you.
A hundred years...
He's the head of the family.
Listen Michael's got a lot of nice people here.
Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I know Michael.
Go your own way but when you are ready come to me the way a son should.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
I'm not afraid of his words.
If I can ever do you a service let me know.
You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
I'm a little short.
I've been out of work.
I'm right.
You must understand this is all new to me...
After all these years why'd you turn against him?
Yeah some deal I made.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.
Nobody gets near you.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.
Hey what's with the food?
thought you were never coming West.
Taken care of me.
Did you ever think of that.
I've always taken care of you.
He said there was something good in it for me...
me on my own.
What about now is there anything you can help me out with?
We have time.
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
To go tonight with me as though we know nothing.
I've already made my move.
I've always known that.
But you told me yourself...
You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.
Sometimes I think...
To have kids to have a family.
I mean are you sure?
What do you mean you I thought...
Wait'll you see!
You know we've never spent a night out on the town together.
Me and you great!
I'd like to come along.
I never met them.
Anybody I know here.
Forget it just go take care of her.
He took the money.
And he agreed?
What did I tell you.
I wish they had.
Make him look bad.
That's why I brought you with me!
For you she is beautiful.
For me there is only my wife!
I hope soon; but it's not over yet and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
I want it to be over before my baby is born.
If you told Michael what I've told you today I'm a dead man.
If he were he'd be dead by now.
You'd have no problem.
He's not the same as when I met him.
Okay just hear me out.
It's not your best side.
What kind of a family is this...
And he asked me...
How does a four year old boy learn the word...
That's not the way we look at it.
How long does this go on?
But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
That's off now.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
for your safety.
We can send out for anything you need.
Will you tell him?
That was three hours ago.
What do you mean gone?
Tell him how you feel.
Michael was kind to her.
Where's my wife?
Yeah give me a minute.
I was in my house.
But she's gone.
Now explain everything to me.
I want it met.
she's all right?
It was a boy.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Go on tell me.
there's something else.
They can come in now.
Where's my brother?
What was it so I'll know.
I took care of it.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
If I'm wrong...
But if you're wrong...
Unless I'm very wrong...
they're already dead.
and on that basis anything is possible.
But your people...
In time you'll understand everything.
If you need anything just...
That gives me time to see my boy.
I'm sorry; of course you know that.
They turned him down.
It might show.
Twenty-five this time.
Yeah that was a good break.
A nice deal.
Yeah it was once.
Yeah it worked.
Those were great old days.
Yeah I still read a lot.
They bring me stuff.
We were young then.
That's my brother.
Just wanted to go home.
Did my brother go back?
I'd like to go outside with him in the open air.
But what does it matter; it was our money.
and the tape will be running.
He would not in any case take the stand.
He is I believe a brother.
If you could just give us a list we'll pick up anything you want.
We're not to let you through.
I know what it meant...
I will make changes; I can.
And we have another child a boy...
The baby I lost...
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away?
You see you'll be happy that I stopped you.
You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost...
and we'll go on you and I.
We'll go back tonight.
Bring the children.
At this moment I feel no love for you at all.
I never thought that could happen but it has.
If that's what it takes; then yes I will.
You are my wife and they are my children...
It had nothing to do with me.
and she had to have kids.
And she did two a boy and a girl.
He gave her money and made her give up the kids.
And that's all he had to do.
Just show his face.
His brother came to help him.
Tell me Michael.
Why too late?
I think it's too late for changes Michael.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.
Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I'm very happy for you...
Also the children - Michael they're here.
It made me think of what you told me once.
That was seven years ago.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.
Yes Michael it does.
Does it feel like a boy?
How's the baby?
I'm sorry Michael.
This is my boy and my wife.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Where can we talk?
Who's asking?
But times are different...
How can you ever lose your family?
No I meant lose his family.
You talk about the baby.
She can have another baby.
that he could...
Well we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.
How are your eyes?
There are still things I have to do.
It's Michael.
We did our first work together worked our way out of the street.
Things were good and we made the most of it.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.
How did the doctor find you?
All but their radio station.
I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.
The money was sent.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others...
I saw an interesting thing today.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Nothing is more important.
I was lucky and he was stupid.
This thing of ours that we will build.
However I can help you...
You're a great man Mr.
But let me tell you the important thing is that you're all right.
One of the things I love about this country.
I heard you had some trouble.
Not for a few years.
Sit down this is almost over.
One by one our old friends are gone.
He takes care of others outside the country you know who I mean.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
How is his health?
We have friends in some very important business that we're making.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.
What is it I can do for you?
In my home!
You heard what happened in my home?
He did business...
Let me run my family without you on my back.
I want them taken care of.
That's why I want you to be fair with them.
so I hope you can explain what you mean.
When do we talk?
No she's here.
On the phone?
We got no choice.
Sure on me.
Sitting right behind you.
See me again in another six months.
But of course you'll let her keep her dog.
How much more a month?
Is that all this conversation means to you?
That's what you're telling me?
I like my life.
I'm a free man.
What will you be ten years from now?
The look on your face!
You mean us?
I still have time to get things right.
If you enjoy it you should do it.
It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Someone who's done things with his life.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
You got that!
He's interested in you for your conversation.
We must put him back.
The police will not know that.
You were not here this morning.
He says here good-bye.
I find it in his room.
He is sorry he says.
He has had a wonderful life.
He did it himself.
I put him to bed.
He's not there?
What have you done with him?
It is my job.
I did it when he was happy and it was easy.
Take care of Mr.
But I still need to talk.
Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
I need to talk to you about Mr.
I have brought you your clothes.
That is what I hope.
You and he are not doing things?
no not really --
You did not know?
You're telling me Mr.
That is why he must go to hell.
I do not think it fair.
His is the worse.
Everybody has those.
You're sure of that?
But now that Mr.
Then you're as single as I am.
He is dead now twenty years.
What's your husband do?
He is a man of trouble.
You need a woman.
You mean family?
We live simply Mr.
How long you worked for Mr.
You go in the living room.
Tea is fine.
Something I can do for you?
Forget everything I say.
Yeah I'm a good man.
Something make you think I'm not?
Are you a good man?
What you are doing is no business of mine.
It's your job lady not mine.
I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
They say you never see the one with your name on it.
But I want to see death coming at me.
Oh but you have.
How will you be able to live with yourself?
I'm not that way.
Get it through your fucking head.
Let's take it off now.
Just for a minute.
Long enough for me to see the effect.
There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.
All gone to me now.
But that was so long ago.
This afternoon at the party.
You've just told one.
A very good story indeed.
You know what he did when I called him?
A chance to be a part of something important.
Something bigger than yourself.
They told him he was too old...
That's not the way he saw it.
To him it was like his life never got started.
Definitely not his family.
A very lucky thing indeed.
He missed out.
The Great War?
Which is true.
Never gave it much thought.
Give us something to do while we wait.
I'd like to try again.
If you're game.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Do I have any other choice?
Ten minutes ago.
Just a night out.
It's not like her.
Run for what?
And we left the top down.
You want to run for it?
Must have been funny for you.
I feel a little out of place.
Is that really her?
The friend I thought was in New York.
Shall we have a drink?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
Do I look okay?
I want -- I want...
Of course I remember.
You just sit there and let me talk.
What a sorry old man you're thinking.
You're the one who started it.
Why do I tell you this?
I never told David.
Something happened to him?
Was that his name?
And he looked up to me.
The Great War.
You had a Good War while we had --
This was World War I?
I was an officer.
Same difference Mr.
I'd like to sit for you again.
From now on Mr.
Cut it out!
How long were you...?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.
I wish I had done more work.
It's so far in the past now.
Over fifteen years --
I'd done ""Show Boat.
Great box office.
Now I was to do something important.
""The Road Back.
But take care Mr.
Too much can be a very bad thing.
Not at the moment.
Tell me more about yourself Mr.
Not before I'm finished with you.
Is that so much to ask?
I'd just rather keep it on.
Can I see what you did so far?
What you do is no business of mine.
Live and let live I say.
Look at me like -- like I look at women.
What way might that be?
I never thought you were.
I'm not you know.
Or a husband.
My friend David.
He lived here for many years.
So you had a wife?
And mine while you're at it.
To sit for me?
Yes I believe you could.
I could have though.
I had to make it interesting for myself you see.
Was it supposed to be funny?
This is a world I finished with long ago.
Lunch should be ready.
This David's a friend?
Is this David's doing?
Where did I get that?
Certainly not from them.
As I said only poor people --
I'll take it off.
Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
It's new.
We'll have a most interesting time.
I have no interest in your body Mr.
And it's just my head you want?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Just a year.
You went to university?
Football in college.
Can you get the door?
I made only the first two.
Sure everybody does.
If you have to ask --
I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
Just got away from me.
Everything alright Mr.
I better get on with my work.
And your name is --?
I think I'll hang around.
She took the night off.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
What sick about that?
I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
I just want to watch it okay?
We'll watch it.
See if his name's on it.
You'll be fine on your own?
I never could.
I'm as free as the air.
I'll never work in this town again?
I was until last night.
Just what I was about to ask you.
I thought you were in New York.
You better go my boy.
Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
But the rest of it?
I've seen far worse cases.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
What's my story there?
You're a lucky man Mr.
More your line.
I would've thought Mr.
Oh no my dear.
So nice to see you...
I can only stay a few minutes.
But if you'd like to sit --
She said you'd been under the weather.
And you said there'd be some of me left.
The way you look at me James.
What have you done this time?
I'll be out this afternoon remember?
She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.
I am sorry Mr.
I will make it short.
It must be up in your old room.
I will look.
How is the old boy these days?
I have my family.
Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
But someone you can talk to.
He is an interesting friend.
Who was that at the door?
You will take them all Mr.
She is horrible.
How could you be working with him?
He looks plenty big.
Yes yes yes.
My mind's lovely.
How is your mind today?
All we did was talk.
I bring them all.
After so many years.
He came cheap.
That's why I wanted you to come to this.
I'm his social secretary now.
I'm the one who got you on Mr.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.
You should probably go home.
Is it your heart?
That's very kind --
""  Tell me everything.
Is there anything in particular you want to know?
There's time to stop before you go too far.
Shall we play?
That's funny Mr.
Let's make it more interesting.
I will answer any question you ask.
I never said you were.
Or will be soon.
I am not dead yet Mr.
Oh no I want to hear everything.
The Great War you know.
You had a Good War but we had a great one.
After you then.
Will that be good for you Mr.
And this is your house.
I've changed my hair you see.
Can we get together while I'm in town?
Now that I know you're around.
How they were just there...
Waiting on us...
Every time I walk...
I think about that night a lot...
Christ what happened to us?
What's with the fish thing --?
The business has changed...
Who do you think?
Who was the job for?
What kind of job...
He took a job.
Now look at us...
About your brother.
That was the deal...
What do you mean --?
He did such a good job on this paper.
And another one just came in...
Well now he's clear.
And you'll stay away from him...
But I had to.
It was the only way to get to you --
It's over Where's the money?
I hope you know what you're doing.
One more night --
Any of 'em...
Your brother has four days.
I knew you'd say that too --
I'm just here about my brother.
I knew you'd say that.
I'm not interested --
They gave me two weeks.
They gave you only four days?
Were it only that easy.
I can come up with the front money.
Pay you back...
When I first heard about this.
They came to me.
They wanted my paper.
He was your brother.
You were the best.
Which would be very bad for me.
Which in turn is very bad for them...
It's about my brother...
It's been a long time...
Let's get out there.
Find out where they're at.
He'll live.
But it means your boy's behind it.
Six years ago I let you go free.
But the next time...
Make it right with those you love.
Hell take 'em with you.
But I want you out of here.
Out of here for good this time...
You know my back.
I want to - once every few months - get into my car.
That's what I want...
Yet your still here...
Your girl works in there...
I'm on the move -
Something like that -
You're thinking: okay there's no want...
Take care of your business.
And this has what to do with me?
Or your baby brother.
Get out of here then.
I got no record.
I'll be out in three days and back at it.
Or you let them go and I give you my word.
You'll leave --?
Let them go.
And I'll leave...
Let them go --
He made a stupid play...
You know my back -
I know you --
What's wrong with it --?
What's this --?
Who is it --?
Just out there.
Where you been anyway?
The other day....
Let's go man --
You mean the poor --
You ever feel bad about any of this?
It's the same way with cars.
Or if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
You just need to remember one thing -
It may not seem like it but the night is long.
And there she is --
You know where the others are?
I think so too --
Yes I do in fact.
There's no one left...
Remember who my brother is?
What does that mean --?
How are we supposed to--
We do it.
He'll get clear Once and for all
I wonder about that every day...
What time of year?
or my letters...
He's a different boy.
He's lost that...
It's gone...
He's in some trouble...
I thought held sort himself out.
He comes and goes.
How is that one?
What are you doing back?
You look good...
I know sir...
Let me just get the-order.
We'll be doing some work out your way.
Just for the night...
I'm a busy man.
can you hold sir --?
We'll take it...
Just hold on...
It was right here.
Then where is it?
Where you off to --?
We're clear now.
I've never actually paid for a car.
You want me to buy her?
They're asking forty thousand.
Give 'em sixty...
I keep thinking about him.
Where'd you find this one?
I've missed you too
I've missed you man...
Whatever will be will be...
But not you...
It's a beautiful business...
Price of doing business...
Know something's up.
you move around...
I'll move to the country.
We do this.
I can see that -
That's what I'm thinking --
What do you got...
Hey you want something to eat?
So you're living up North?
You sure you're okay --?
We're almost there...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Just hold-on there --
Like my feet.
You all right --?
It's good to see ya man.
You changed your look -
Now we go -
Thirty-seven to go...
Call 'em here --?
Today's Wednesday.
He's knows of one all right.
You know of one --?
For real point-five.
This time it's for real?
I know a place.
We got one more to go --
They got him to the hospital.
How is he --?
We're off...
Man can you corner...
Know not to get on it...
Let me worry about The Club...
What about The Club...
You're turned over...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Easy to get around...
For a man with...
We could stay here all night...
They're just...
She was so great why'd you leave her?
I had a girl.
She was great.
The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years.
So you seeing anybody?
What the hell's that --?
And give me up in the process.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
You mentioned that in your letters
I go with you --
I put the boys on it.
She's trouble --
We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
One of a kind.
What's wrong with her --?
If you change your mind.
So long now...
What the hell are you doing --?
Six or seven...
Only the two weeks have turned into four days.
What kind of trouble --?
And here I am...
I left town.
You left me remember?
I got a coffee.
What's with the look?
I'll see you soon --
You need him...
If we put out the word.
Go to them.
They'll be happy to see you...
But when that car was gone I missed it.
Go find them.
Is he still working here?
The hard part...
It can be done.
You think it can be done?
Old-age happened.
Whatever do you mean?
So what's in there --?
So they let me in right?
Give me all these numbers.
Now I just go anywhere I want.
But my birthday's in seven months...
I live next door...
See what you got...
You know what you got here?
Shit all looks the same here --
Which way's out man --?
He was in an argument.
It goes off.
Hey, look at him.
That's what he gave me.
You're all I got.
I knew I was wrong.
But I'm okay now.
On my children.
Right in my face.
It was easy money.
I did it in the can.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Why would I get into that?
You did what you had to do.
I'm talking from now on, outside.
I'm talking right here.
Why would I get into that shit?
Oh I Him.
What did you hear about that thing?
What about the kids' school?
What about the schools?
Shit You know they would have never found it.
My God, why did you have to do it?
They went through everything.
They would have found it.
That was forty, fifty thousand.
What did you want me to do with it?
They were all over the house.
The stuff I left.
Just get me out.
People are already looking to walk away from me.
I'm dead in here.
Be wants to know what's happening.
That's more than I can say for the rest.
What did he say, exactly?
I had everybody working.
Now, come on.
You just start looking for a new place.
We're getting out of here.
Is he putting food on the table?
We've got to help ourselves.
We just have to be careful while we do it.
Yes, you can.
I've got it set up.
Believe me, in a month we'll be fine.
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.
We've got to help each other.
I'm in here!
She's been here.
I've been all over town.
Why should I give him up to someone else?
Why should she win?
Whatever you want, we'll do.
They do stuff with the wrong people.
What did you expect.
After what you did!
That's what everybody said.
We can talk about it.
I thought it was next week.
When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
Have more coffee.
Without him, they've got no case.
What fucking good are these things?
What do I need this for?
I'm not paying for this shit.
I better call again.
What do you care about her.
Have a drink first.
Give'm a drink.
It's been six months.
He's good for it.
It was business.
Keep 'em coming.
Bring the car round back.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.
Will you stop.
My father got a letter from the school.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Just make sure you do it.
I know what to do!
Now this is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
Call from an outside phone.
You know what to do?
They're okay and it's worth it.
Just watch this.
This girl I told you about?
Can you believe this shit?
You believe this shit?
I mean, she's beautiful.
This is fucking bad.
Keep him here.
That guy's got no right.
I'll make it up.
You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
Hey, come on.
Look around here.
It felt funny.
But it'll be okay.
I got some money for you.
He says he's too hot.
I got so much else on my mind.
I got the kids.
We got no money.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Daddy never went out at all.
What kind of people are these?
You're the one who wanted us here.
He's with his friends.
That's important.
We'll take care of the schools.
We'll pick it up.
That's the only way they'll stop.
You think you're the only one?
You think they give a shit about anything?
You know me all my life.
I've always done the right thing.
If you knew those fucking kids.
Will knows him.
Oh great, tell her that!
Watch what happens.
Who's she talking to?
No, I had to talk him down.
Let me tell you what I do know.
But you know what the best part of my day is?
You just left.
Why is it always this?
I want to live here the rest of my life.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
You know all the girls I been with.
How's the woman?
Who'd you call?
No, and we got four of 'em.
That's just my way.
But Will's not usually like that--
When I made the decision to come over here it felt right.
She'll live.
Is this a bad time?
This is my mother's house.
I just stop by help out.
I'm good like that.
This is your house right?
How'd you know where to find me?
Yeah not tonight.
Not any other night.
Ah history I think.
I had to let him help with the car.
What'd you say about me?
Save it for your mother funny guy.
We heard it before.
"" So he's like ""All right fine.
Some other guy?
I told you ""no"" yesterday!
I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Come on Will...
I told you I just got change.
"" I bought it.
She's not stupid.
It's fifteen minutes out of our way.
--and he's like ""shit!
Will you take a check?
I have about seventy-three...
I'm not sure--
Hey I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar.
Good it was all right.
How'd you like that course?
What class did you say that was?
That's exactly right Will.
Come on that's what you do.
And what do you see?
Okay you're in your bed Will.
Now how old are you?
I just need his name.
Which one's your building?
Yeah can I help you?
Thank you Will.
Do it if it's what you really want.
He says you start working for them next week.
No that's fine Will.
I can come back.
That's right Will.
Most days I wish I never met you.
I'll give you a job myself.
I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Will on your own time you can do what you like.
It's right.
Take it home with you.
That's fine but did you ever think--
I'm pretty sure it's right.
This is correct.
Get out Will.
He left I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes.
--Half-red half-black--
Half-red half-black--
I happen to know so.
I'll do the work.
If I agree to this I walk right now?
That you meet with me twice a week--
Under two conditions.
Find out what?
So who won the bet?
Could you help us?
About thirty million to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers.
How about one now?
You should come.
I got one of those too.
Do you know when you'll be back?
So I hear you're taking some time.
He's not you!
It's not about that!
It's about the boy!
Do you want me to go home and get it for you?
Then will you let the boy--
I know who I am.
Oh that's nice--
--And why does he hang out with his friends?
He's got problems--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Now wait a minute--
I brought you in here to help me with this boy not to run him out--
Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Look you took one road and I took another.
I'm not getting back at you.
But it's important to start early.
Well you're the only one.
That's exactly not the point.
Jobs doing what?
Well have you talked to him at all about his future?
I been here a couple years.
I live right around the corner.
We went to college together.
Oh what is this?
"" You sat there for an hour?
It's on the college.
That would be fine.
Can we do it at my office?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
How many people did you try before you came to me?
This boy is like that.
I've never seen anything like him.
I got your card.
You were missed.
How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I've been busy.
But it's only given out every four years.
The boy was here.
He came in sat down and we worked together.
There is somebody...
Can I make it back to my house?
Christ set her free.
You go to church?
I mean, Christ.
A guy as well known as you?
I'm sure you do.
I talked to you.
It's just something I know to be true.
I might understand that.
Like what Will?
No but I mean you know...
I do other things.
That no one knows about.
Will your not getting off that easy.
Yeah I read your book.
And I'm not saying that's wrong.
He's been to my house for dinner.
That's in my book.
Now you know Will and I know what you need to be doing.
You did your time.
You're a free man.
We're done?
That's what you want?
Which one did you take Will?
--No have you had any experience with that?
Have you had any experience with that?
You want to read it?
Look a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.
And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
Well I'm here.
So is that my problem?
I been there.
I played my hand.
You're right Will.
Nobody gets what they ask for Will.
It's not about that job.
I'm not saying you should work for the government.
But you could do anything you want.
That's what I'm saying Will.
Not to me they're not.
What did I think?
They could see that I meant it.
You should have seen this girl.
So wait a minute.
What a game that was.
When did you know she was the one?
Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Well I've read you colleagues.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
How'd the date go?
I read your book last night.
That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
My wife's dead.
So Christ call her up.
She's different from the other girls I met.
We have a really good time.
Yeah I went on a date last week.
You got a lady now?
You know a lot about him I bet.
I see a boy.
Nobody could possibly understand you right Will?
You must know everything about me.
You're just a boy.
So what's with this place?
Is this something you'd like to talk about?
Time's up.
I will end you.
She leave you?
--Well maybe that means you.
Tell me what you really think.
This is a real piece of shit.
WILL Oh yeah?
Yeah it did take me a long time.
That must have taken you a long time.
Yeah I read those.
Have you read all these books Will?
I love you Will.
I just wanted to call before you left.
You know what I want to hear?
I just want to be with you.
What you want to come in here and save me?
Did you ever think that maybe I could help you?
That maybe that's the point that we're a team?
Yes I do Will.
Oh is that what this is about?
Is that what you want to hear?
I'm not honest?
You're afraid of me.
I'm afraid too.
You think I want this?
I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father.
But that's life.
And I deal with it.
You're the one that's afraid.
Is that what you think--
What do you mean ""What am I afraid of?
Then what are you afraid of?
Look Will if you're not in love with me you can say that.
"" What is that?
And you're sure about that?
I just feel it.
Yeah but how do you know?
I just do.
I want you to come with me.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
He saw all of that music in his head.
I'm trying to explain it to you.
Come one Will.
I just want to know.
Especially for someone like you.
Some a little.
How do you remember your phone number?
Let me ask you a question?
This is what I'm doing with that money.
I could have done anything I wanted.
What do you have to worry about?
Why is it important to you?
It's important that I learn this.
Want me to take a look?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
We'll go.
What about your friends?
When do I get to meet them?
I've never seen your place.
Why do we always stay here?
I'm supposed to understand this.
You should have called.
I want to go out with you.
Let me take you out.
You were busy?
You know I really was waiting for you to call me.
I'm sorry I been real busy.
I want to meet them.
I live with three of them now.
Do you know all their names?
There was always someone to play with give you advice.
You know nothing special.
I bet you have a great family.
Oh you will?
In that case fine.
So you just want to use me and go?
I was happy to pay.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Sounds good where are you now?
Okay you got me.
It's Will the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
See it's my life story.
Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Okay sounds good.
Here's my number.
Well look I have to go.
And by the way.
I'm Will.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me.
I'll run my business my own way.
I got work.
If not just sit here that's all.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Twenty days work oh boy!
Will ya look at her!
How about it John?
They just *got* to hang it on somebody you know.
Woman looks at it like that.
I was though.
I'd come back--
I never had to lose...
You never was like that before.
She got to make it.
Reckon she'll make it?
An' these here are our own people all of 'em.
Maybe the road's out.
You can come on.
Lots must a died too.
People done it.
If they could we could.
What a place!
About the face?
What'd he look like again?
We just picked him up on the way in.
Move along and go to work right away.
Can all of you work?
Sure but what is this?
Want to work?
I'm just working here.
If you want it take it.
Two an' a half!
Number's on the door.
Better take care of it.
That cut you got?
How many of you?
I just got to have certain information.
I hear it.
I got to *ask*.
Not much but we had it.
An' you know what that is?
Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
I'll tell 'em.
We come to work here.
No I done my time an' got out.
How ya boy?
How about us?
I'll say 'em--an' make it short.
Think she'll hold?
All right you remember the *man* then.
This used to be mine.
You reckon they could be dead?
They never wrote you nothing?
They're all gone--or dead.
That's our place.
It always is this time a year.
I'll go your way.
That's why they only gave me seven years.
I'd do what I done again.
Ought to be.
A girl was just a girl to you.
Maybe *that's* love.
There's just what people do.
But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Next time do it again.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
*Used* to be.
I lost the call.
But boy I sure *used* to have it!
But not no more.
On my way home now.
Just follow the line.
Pull up behind that car.
Okay for this one.
Take 'em through.
Want to work do you?
Take her out.
*Used* to be your land.
But this is *my land* son.
I got two little kids.
I got a wife and my wife's mother.
Them people got to eat.
I never asked you!
That's where I get off.
Ask me anything you want.
Been there four years.
Like to know anything else?
Get to what?
I seen your hands.
Got a trade?
Just a few miles.
This here's my country.
Listen to me just a minute.
All but me!
We *got* to go.
We got no place to stay.
Take her with you!
I'll walk back.
Want to walk back?
Well you just turn around and walk the other way.
Thought I'd take a walk.
Any law against it?
I be back a little later.
You take this.
No--an' look what I got for you.
Stand by the door.
Anybody ask anything?
This got a floor.
That's the way I always heard it.
We're the people that live.
We're the people.
Make her easy John.
Never was no good an' never will be--
So some on.
You'll *what*?...
Soon or later they'll get me for one thing if not another.
About what he said what he done an' about how he died.
An' I remember all of it.
an' you'd be in trouble too.
I sure wish I could see you then.
It had to come I reckon soon or later.
Then you can come out.
Stay an' help.
They know he got hit in the face.
Felt like it.
Looks like you done it.
What'd you hear?
Save that for later.
You *got* to keep clear.
Honest I am.
An' we're still together-- most of us.
Says they'll send you up again.
Yes'm that was it.
And they's some coffee here.
That's them!
What was the use.
Some say I am.
You want to hear what happened?
Started it anyway.
But who done it?
But what's happened?
How come they got to get off?
We been here fifty years--same place.
I know that!
But *where* they gone?
If I did I'd tell you.
It's a company.
You mean get off my own land?
They told me to tell you you got to get off and that's what I'm telling you.
Me an' you both.
I'd like to hear some more about that.
How you get all this money?
Look at 'em!
But what about this?
Maybe he'll be back.
We'll leave word for him.
Maybe it's nice on the other side.
You do not see either!
Well I see you been busy already!
Now you done it!
What's these?
We can pick anything.
You people looking for work?
I move all of those--
You're so funny...
You do not.
Whatever I can get away with.
So what are you doing now?
Remember high school?
Not much actually.
you work your whole life day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all.
One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
To make a long story short...
Basically the same thing.
Can I finish my story please?
And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
That's for you.
Six Day Week.
What is is.
What if I come back?
That's probably a good idea.
You never could have kept this from me.
Like that there's a point?
Which usually means your time is up.
I was but no...
I was before but now I'm not.
"" We sort of found each other...
About five years now.
It's something I do...
Is it something you've done?
Not the other way around...?
Even though I left you never left me.
I have to give this some thought.
It's just a game...!
--She's not dead---
Would you rather...
Which would you rather...?
Do you want to get a drink first?
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven.
Seven it is.
Let me get this straight are you asking me out?
That'd be good.
You met people.
Well there's not much to tell.
It's always the little things.
Well you'll have a ball.
You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back.
That's part of it.
to my being?
You see someone?
I suppose the most important thing really.
I thought you know...
maybe seeing you some friends my house...
More like what happened?
What happened Mr.
But I'll come back.
What's your business?
Not much else.
That's about it really.
Here is now there.
There is here.
Well let me see...
Ten years I think.
What I miss?
I am at home with the me.
Anyway that never use to happen.
I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long.
You know where I live?
and I know where you live.
made themselves a part of something.
And they can talk about what they do.
You went to school with these people.
Or with anyone?
Up on the right.
We can think with each other think for each other.
And you have a very big mind.
Sometimes I am.
Well let's just say that sometimes I'm right.
Sometimes you are.
You look like you're far away.
Far away and thinking about other things.
See I can think on my feet.
You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening.
What's the big deal right?
Do you like the people you work with?
How was your day today sir?
""On my own.
"" That's the whole point.
You can drink coffee in the morning...
Hard to get good help these days.
Come on live a little.
And a coffee.
This thing's real.
Everybody's in.
And you could be...
sort of like...
a father figure to me....
Like a club.
Work less make more.
Like a union?
here's a special one.
That sounds pretty interesting...
For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
If he does our job he's our job.
Look at his face.
He using her.
Wait a minute--
Do his job?
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
He never saw me.
But I saw him though.
I'm telling you you never met the man.
Okay call them.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
I've looked at it.
I'll do it tomorrow.
This is not good.
See you next week.
It'd be so easy.
There's nothing to be done about it.
You leave tonight.
And they want me to make up for it.
I'm not happy.
They're not happy sir.
I'll pay.
And not show it to me.
You know what I do for a living.
Throw that away.
I have Mr.
Tell them that's not my problem.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Take care of her.
Of course you will.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
See you in ten years.
I have to get my head back into my work.
As long as you had a good time.
What the hell happened to you?
He gave me a great deal.
He sold me this bad boy.
God it's great to see you.
Got on the team.
So what happened to you?
How did you get this job?
So what are you doing with your life now son?
I took the other road.
So what do you want to talk about?
The point was to love each other.
Then what have we been doing?
I mean what was the point?
And what if I decide not to go?
We'd be together.
Show me again.
Takes what we've got just for now.
I'm supposed to --
Not for anybody.
I want you to stand on him.
Everything under control?
How did you find out all that?
Yeah I think it is.
I hear that!
Maybe have one or two more.
They'd play with my brother's kids.
We did at one point.
When we thought we'd have more children.
And we after tried.
We tried everything but...
Ever think of moving there full time?
Sounds like a beautiful place.
She was never really happy here.
She did the best she could.
When she played it was...
How did you meet her?
My son was born here.
How long did you live here with your wife?
You look all right.
You want to pick it up a little?
Just sit the horse.
I'll stop talking then.
Yeah it's been a while but I...
The answer's no.
Enjoy the day.
He's beautiful.
He's young.
is my wife...
We used to live in that house together.
But the house is fine.
It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard.
What's that to miss?
It's beautiful country I'll give you that.
It's a man's world Mr.
Most women have to.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Well it's worth it really?
So here's the deal.
When I work with a horse it's no good just me doing it.
You want us to come with you?
I just have to run to the main house and give Mr.
Just take a look at him.
If you still feel the same way I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again.
All by yourself?
It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
I brought him along.
here it is...
I'd like you to take a look at my horse.
I understand your situation.
But there's nothing I can do.
You just called the wrong person that's all.
Maybe you should call one of them.
And I'm not even doing them for a while.
Well if you could just come for the day.
you help people with horse problems.
Oh I miss you.
that's just not his way.
Maybe you can write him a letter or something.
Say thank you...
You take care and I'll see you home.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
I was just me.
about what I said.
one of the most...
Yeah well you've done a great job.
if that's wrong then I'm sorry.
I do it for you...
NO YOU STOP IT!
Yeah you know everything!!
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I think we'd just be in Mr.
I'll come.
There's no food in the house?
Would you like to stay in town for dinner?
You got everything you need?
You already did.
It's actually pretty...
Dad wants to talk to you.
There was supposed to be a turn off.
Did I miss it?
What would they say?
No you just act like you do.
it's not that simple to explain.
I know you think it is but it's not.
Then why do you want to leave?
Did he tell you that?
Whatever problems your father and I are having have nothing to do with this.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
It's about you!
About you always being right!
Who do you think I'm doing this for?
I'm doing this for you!
Do you want us to turn around and go back home?
Is this it now?
This'll be nice.
When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
Would you like to see that?
When you went running.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Look if you want to take it in the morning that's fine.
-- enough time tomorrow.
It's just that we may not have enough --
We have to get up early tomorrow.
You may not have enough time to --
Maybe they should put me down too.
I think that's...
I think we should.
He'd hate living like that.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
It's still early.
What's your next class?
You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I'm not coming back!
I want to go home!
I mean what --
Dad'll pick you up today all right?
Speak to you then.
The work is getting done David.
Is that absolutely necessary?
It'll just make it a bigger story.
Let's just go and...
we'll see...
You want to take a walk with me?
I have so much to tell you.
I made good time.
I always felt lucky...
one way or the other.
Probably first thing in the morning.
It's too late to start now.
I told the office I'd work out of there next week.
When are you planning to start back?
Let's not talk about that now.
You were right about coming here.
I'm sorry for not thinking...
Good at what he does.
You have every right to come.
Listen if you need to come back and you want me to come take over for a while I'll work it out.
Actually today was a good day.
You should have seen her.
Everything all right.
We miss you too.
maybe I will take some time...
You know I just asked that myself tonight.
Well it's good that you're there.
No that's not what I said.
If you feel you should come then come.
Just do whatever you think is right.
She will if you think she should.
I just know it!
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
He said it takes time.
I'll just take that time now...
You want to do this by yourself?
What are you -- you're serious about this?
I think it would be good for her.
He did but...
I think I can change his mind.
You just said he said no.
What was I saying?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Why did you go?
I thought to myself we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody.
How was the dinner?
You've got to stop doing that?
I kept thinking about the baby...
You're so early.
LIFE WITHOUT CARE...
It's on the table by the phone.
Whether or not we were...
We're very lucky.
I wanted to say something...
No I'll go.
No let me go.
I should go get some of her things.
No it's got a little left.
They'll be in to change it.
We'll see you later then.
We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place...
I just have to get used to it.
What do you want to do about dinner?
You want me to pick you up?
I should be in by two.
He had the choice.
We have a business manager.
The best around.
Nobody's using it.
You know that's interesting.
It's just one night.
I already know the way...
Now are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself?
No no I'll go -- just give me a list.
Is there anything you need?
But he's still a man.
We all have to find the life meant for us.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or...
Just not sure if I want to.
No it's more like a leave of-  Ha ha ha.
Well I have more than a few days ha ha...
I'm sort of...
I'd love to go there one time...
to time itself almost.
No reason you should no reason you should.
I'll help you with the coffee.
Oh it's...
You're all doing too much.
You tend to when you have more than one even though you love 'em all the same.
I never knew him.
This here's...
Hard to find a place.
Would you mind if I did?
Just do what you can.
- See what you can do for him --...
Well of course right...
Well it was nice to meet you Mr.
Private as can be.
Must've thought it was worth it.
Saw it on a television show once.
Now son you tell 'em when it came from.
Weekend after next...
Told the kids.
And they're good mother.
We should be fine then.
Of course I have.
You want to try it on?
you've got to do this.
I want to watch.
It's more or less how it sounds.
Sometimes it's not pretty to watch.
Take you time.
You do whatever you have to to hold on...
I'll tell you one more thing...
you know what I think?...
I know where he goes.
The same thing would have happened to me...
And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...
I used to try and...
always came up short.
what we do with what we get.
He was sixteen.
It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
Are you afraid of anything?
That must have been pretty special.
Not a question of if you can -- you are.
Just follow this.
Well there's only one way to find out.
Give it a little gas.
It's never too soon to start.
I'm not old enough yet.
That's not a question is it?
What does she do?
She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Your mother around?
No wait it just goes...
and I said that""...
Do you want to go around by the old road?
I just could never say it!
You think the same thing!
Can I come?
I'll start a fire...
My parents are having friends from college over.
They're really nice...
He said he had work to do until late.
You want to watch some television?
We order something else?
You shut up stupid!
YA JUST HAD A TURN.
IT WAS NOT.
IT WAS MY TURN!
We still have a way to go.
I was always good.
You ever miss it?
What are you looking at young man?
The number's by the phone.
Oh I clear forget.
You had a call from some woman in New York.
If it's not too much trouble I thought I might.
You're looking fit.
You have a good day now...
you know a lot of this stuff...
I'd love to learn more about it myself.
What stuff is that?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Well that'll happen.
""This is our world now.
It looks good sir.
See we're very busy.
Let's keep her.
And hang up and get your money back!
Was that her top?
What is it with this guy?
The Red Book.
Yo everyone check this out.
Well I got a lot alright?
That's far out!
I thought you was black man!
Hold on a second!
Yo hit the lights.
I want it to have my children!
It was him man!
But he does know things.
We have no names man no names.
I help we can do it in six.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.
With me we can do it in seven.
You know who he is?
And what's he do?
And would you try and please fill these out?
No one special.
Did we meet someone special?
What did we learn in school today?
How was school?
Well yes he could be playing with himself.
Yes I'll ask.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open please?
And happy birthday.
This is the end my friend.
Give it up!
Just give it up.
Yeah maybe I'm not.
I mean she came to me to figure it out.
What can I tell you.
Watch which friends you do play with.
For us there's no such thing as family and friends.
He got me.
I help we can do it in five minutes man.
What's this one eat?
Look out man.
Never heard of you.
Anyway you're pretty good.
You would have looked better.
Let's get 'em.
Alright so what have we got?
I'll make it up to you!
I got a record.
Why did he come to you?
I know I know who wrote it.
Okay thank you.
I really need your help.
Make it our first date.
Make it my first born.
What was it.
But you knew that.
It's too much machine for you.
I said give me time.
He's not in this class.
Think you can do better?
No you're not in my class.
You mean I'm not in your class?
Here's your class.
We want you to help us find it.
I think we've got something.
I is here.
They're asking me about it alright?
Will you take a look for me?
Yo what's up?
But not in that order necessarily right?
I'm in this computer right?
So I'm looking around...
You know you're right about that.
Check it Friday.
It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
What is he doing in here?
How much do they know?
So we get the mother we get the boy.
So what are we supposed to do?
What number please?
I'll take you down there.
Should be on the road.
Come with us!
She's not dead!
No no we have to get out of here right now.
We've been better.
Are you two okay?
Well you found out this morning?
When did you find this out?
Its about tonight.
I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
The number's next to the phone.
Its too late.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You know how important that is.
Hang on Mrs.
We should call the fire department.
I told them to be here by nine.
How do you know their not?
Oh stupid question.
It's okay..
Its all right...
It's a four hour drive.
How many people in the bus?
I've said this before.
You let them take it out of here.
Check him out.
Okay everybody listen up.
State police are on the way.
Like the last time?
How many kids?
Looks to me like your out of business.
What the hell did this?
I've got you come on go down.
Can we stay out all night?
I thought you said you were ready.
But you wanted to go out tonight.
Its no big deal.
Come on Sunday.
I wish she could do the same for me.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.
It's been eleven months.
Like a real sister?
Like a sister?
Oh serious questions tonight.
Of course I love you.
I've just been there.
That's the first place he'll look for you.
Where's the school house?
Where is the school house?
Everybody's dead.
First door on the right.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him but I've got to try.
Its not over yet.
Somebody's wife?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Go to my house.
Can anyone hear me?
Be here in a minute.
He's been here.
When he makes that call.
Its always got a face and a name.
Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.
Now you understand?
Well are we still on for tonight?
Listen I'll call you in an hour or so.
Wait a minute here...
YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow.
This has not been my night.
You'll have to.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
What's this big big news?
I hate that dog.
That's probably all he can do.
He can still watch.
He was watching me.
I saw someone standing in Mr.
Sure see you later.
I've already lost it.
Why did you hang up on me?
You never go out.
He was standing right here.
It's only three houses away.
We can keep each other company.
I have a place for that.
I want to stay here and watch this.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Get him out of here!
Is that all you say?
I wonder where they went.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here.
I found the car!
I'll stay out with you tonight Doctor just on the chance that you're right.
They could be.
Exactly what do you need?
I'll check back in an hour.
He was here earlier tonight and he may be coming back.
I met him fifteen years ago.
They may be right.
Anybody live here?
May be a few minutes.
I'd like to talk to you if I could.
They probably stopped off somewhere.
Have her call me when she gets back.
Well she's totally not here.
I thought she'd be home by now.
She went to pick up Paul.
I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
DO WHAT I SAY!
I said stop it!
We're no getting anywhere.
There was no one outside.
I saw him outside.
It's all make believe.
There is no such thing.
I can see why.
Why are they under there?
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Will you read to me?
Same time same place.
Are you coming over tonight?
You tell them to call the police and send them over here.
You're coming with us...
You've had enough.
Everybody has a good time tonight.
Okay kids what do you want to do now?
Well go tell her it's me okay?
Will you get her for me?
He was doing all right last night.
How could he get there?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night.
There's nothing else I can do.
He said something else.
""It's all right now.
Ever done anything like this before?
What did you use before?
That should take four hours if we're lucky then we're on our way.
That's my type.
any sister talk?
A lot of works.
That's just --
Well let's do it.
You want to see some?
Are you really interested?
Well let's hope so.
I said that but...
he said it was something he really felt like doing.
But I'm seeing him.
No he called late last night.
Yeah we have Mr.
I'm real low on money.
If we went...
It depends on what way you want to go.
we have seen a lot of stuff today though.
It's really terrible.
It's almost...
Oh is that what it is?
Oh in this we're a big hit.
We're a big hit.
No really I really like him a lot.
It's terrible!
Yeah it was funny it was very funny.
Oh that was a wonderful show.
I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
we could do that.
They fit right in together.
But I wanted to...
What time do you get off?
Oh what what do you do?
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Is the food that bad?
Is this your first job?
Only a few.
Do you like 'em?
Well if it's nothing then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?
I mean it's it's nothing.
I always I-I always imagine that I have things.
I mean he's you know he's--
This time I really think I have something.
I'll-I'll walk.
It's not that big a deal.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.
Oh it's very beautiful.
yeah some of them are very big.
are they big?
I got a lot more to learn though.
Yes but you name names.
Half the country's doing it!
Ah it's over!
I care a great deal about him yes.
Now I've met someone else.
I've got to be honest with you.
I met someone else.
I-I-I know.
Oh not here.
There are too many people around.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
I want you to take care of me...
And I love when you do things to me.
I-I-I want to do things for you.
Not that you need me.
Oh all the time.
This is not an easy situation.
No no-no-no I'm sure.
Oh please I have to go.
Yes but you you do care about me.
It's my responsibility now.
I will work things out.
But-but but how about you?
But not over me?
She'd tell me such a thing.
What do you expect me to say?
I-I-I-I I realize.
Why you know the situation.
I-I I'm sorry.
I know it's terrible.
I-I'm I-I'm sorry.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
I have to talk to you for...
There's so much that I want to tell you.
Did you ever read this one--?
Oh I would love to hear it.
Oh you-you have that one?
Oh yeah that's really nice of you.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Well yeah yeah.
You'd love it.
You'd have a good time.
I know you would.
Yes I'd...
I-I-I'd love I'd love to get you this.
She looks at the book.
Oh oh yes.
I'd like to get you this.
you learn so much.
Everything's okay?
I-I-I understand completely.
Unless of course if-if you had some time I mean we could get some coffee.
Well you sure picked the right place.
I mean you can stay here all afternoon not buy anything and just read.
What book did you want to buy?
Yes it's-it's wonderful.
They have everything here.
Well i-if-if you have some free time...
You'd really love it.
Oh you know what?
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
I'll never understand it.
Well why do you still go to those?
Well I live--
I have a client near here and I...
I'm quite early.
You're out looking here?
Oh what in this section of town?
So so what else?
You're not lost.
I feel lost.
You matter to me.
Well what do you do?
Do you do you do you phone them?
They- they seem to know so much about us.
I-- Every time I bring it up you- you change the subject.
Well what is it then?
Eh what's come between us?
do you find me too...
personal they could only have come from you.
About our-our personal life?
But you keep asking these these awful questions.
My God it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
I am in love with someone else.
Are you in love with someone else?
I-I-I know but there's got to be some give and take.
Yeah but I...
I-it's all very...
But what do what do you--  what's that mean?
I want one with you.
But you got four children!
Well tell me.
Is there something wrong?
It's so late.
Let's go have dinner shall we?
Have you tried these?
It's on the table Dad.
Who's got some--  Oh there it is.
Here let me get you some coffee.
That's enough of that.
just for a second.
Oh no I just see I-I've been very very lucky.
If not I'll deal with it then.
When I'm dead I'll be dead.
Why should I be afraid?
Why not your own people?
Now I'm giving it serious thought.
How can we be happy?
I thought that you would be happy.
Oh God that's too much responsibility for me.
I want a husband maybe even a child before it's too late.
I have to move out!
What's the difference?!
It's just somebody I met!
So you met somebody else?
I'm saying it now!
You've been with someone!
Oh yes you have!
I always told you you would leave me.
does it have to be now?
I thought maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
I have to move out.
Oh you know what.
I was but I'm not.
He's my sister's husband.
And I think if you gave him half a chance you'd like him.
Based on what?
You never even see him.
He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Well there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.
you are the only person I can be with...
who I really look forward to being with.
How about something to eat?
Want some coffee or tea?
That makes everything...
I--How was I to know?!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Look at this guy.
I know she...
I think we need to eat.
I'm-I'm okay.
Yeah I-I-I you know I...
I'm-I'm...
I mean everyone thinks things like that.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.
Oh he's fine.
You know how's everything?
Oh me I'm okay.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Is that your idea?
Is there no chance?
Go right over there.
That's really nice!
so I so I like that.
The few times that I've met him...
Open them up.
Everything's good.
I got two minutes.
from my first show you know?
He's all show!
You know you're awful.
Yeah we're having some problems but problems that are my business...
They're private!
""You're so giving.
We love you.
Do I do I put people off?
Is that how you see us?
Hey what's the matter?
take a year.
Take six months.
Maybe you'll maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
You want to write?
There's nothing I would--
Yeah you mean not at my age.
Well-well like what?
Well that-that's good.
But what I decided to do is some writing.
Now let's face it here.
You know--something with a future.
an idea for a story.
Which is why I have to speak to you.
Oh what do they know?
So what's new?
Nobody but you can do that to me.
Boy you really know how to cut me down.
Well maybe I'll get it.
No I- I-I no I-I just...
You know you know how you take...
I know no--  I know.
Well I mean why not?
Yeah can you believe it?
Of course I'll never get it.
You found all this all this out on one date?
Well I I really like that.
Well how about this?
Maybe at Christmas New Year's.
If not this New Year's maybe next New Year's.
Be careful with those.
He's got a good job.
Would you light those please?
I thought she was moving out!
She really does though.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Well in order to get started there's just a few things I have to buy...
No no we decided!
You know I was talking with your father before...
and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.
It'd made a great story I think.
many years later...
It's you know it's a...
Just a few minutes ago.
When'd you get here?
It's just your husband.
I mean are you are you are you are you free this evening?
So so you want to go out to dinner again?
I mean is that is that...
Have you have any interest in that or...
I was the I was...
One day about a month ago...
Well you seem fine now.
Yeah I care.
I-I you know I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Would you like to have lunch?
It was just great.
You-you made my day.
I'm I you know...
Oh it just came to me one day.
I just think it's wonderful!
I'm I'm totally...

No you can tell me straight.
Just you know tell me what you think.
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
Well could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Well you know I-I-I...
you know if you want me to I'll read it.
But she just...
Oh well God I can imagine what you wrote.
So what's it about?
I'm-- Yes.
No the reason I ask is--
that I wrote?
Nobody ever said it.
No, I am.
No, you can tell me.
well, you-you're not interested in this.
Well, that's interesting.
I've been trying to write.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Should I have not asked it?
just some stuff.
A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Oh, nothing much.
Yeah, and for yours.
I'm sure you've changed.
Yeah, I hope you have, too.
Well, I hope you've changed.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
in a really horrible way.
I'd never do that.
Yeah, it was.
It was a terrible evening.
and I thought I'd come in and...
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
I had a great time tonight, really.
What do you, what do you do?
I'm-I'm my own person.
Can we, can we go?
But, no, you've been doing that all night!
Yeah, okay, right.

Oh, my God.

And I, and I wanted to, you know.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...
Who would that be.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
You want me to be?
Then who's buying it?
I asked you how you like your coffee...?
What have they got you doing?

Why would you say that?
I was told...
One moment I'm not done with you...
That could be.
What is that supposed to mean...?
Well you know that happens on the street.
Hey you know I never thought of that...
I said how's your baby...?
How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
A wonderful country...

But it seemed as if they as if they...
Who does not?
Indeed I am.

To your New Wife...
You have given it to her and some of...
Lucky man indeed.
How could you know?
You were out of the country.
In the middle of the day.
An old story.
A lovely story.
Why did you look at me that way?
I'll have them picked up.
I never met him.
The government says.
You have to go away.
Is it necessary to know?
I realize you're under a lot of....
I came to pay my...
Ask me then...
And fine alright and fine...

You look lovely.
Do right and you'll live through this.
AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD do you understand...
The girl needs help.

The girl could use some help.
I want to buy a dog.

That's what I should do.
Tell me why?
Look what they put her on...
Oh baby oh baby....
What's that Baby?
Ask me when we get home.
No he simply...
what do you expect me to...
they asked us to dinner.
I am here...
Fine thank you but
speaking of which:
I want the money.
I know something no one knows.
On his left hand.
And why should we believe you?
I know where he is.
what did you want?
Hey, lost again.
It would seem.
What're they on about?
yes, yes, yes....
I've got to make some money.
I feel that...
But they were not there.
That's what he was.
An' that's what he left us.
That's really all we have time for.
Play their game.
Why are you here...?
What is your point?
And you have decided to accept...
You said:  that you have ""decided.
And get on with your job.
that's all we have time for today...
I used it.
How do you think that made him feel?
would you use a small word?
his need for...
Yes so you said.
Then that being so why is today special?
Why have you come back to see me?
That's all part of it.
What is this new job they've...?
Tell me why...?
Do you see?
You can look at me.

Ah yes ah yes.
How terrible for you...
Ooh that's it.
You think you're so...
but you're just...
I never told anyone that before.
Why are you...
About three days.
Believe me I wish I knew less.
Now run away.
Summer would have been a lot less without you.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
What did I do this time?
it's it's too major...
Jesus I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy.
I'm right right?
I have to see her...
Much easier in like a club.
]                                  ] There you are.
You have to be better.

Oh thanks it was nothing...
Hear anything good?
Why are you so nice to me?
a very special moment...
Sorry about all that...
He's just so...
That wants to be a Yes.
That would be a No.
Have you two ever...
It's just funny...
It seems silly.
Why do you even like me?
You're right I miss him.
You look a like you could use a friend.
"" Or some fucking thing.
I just never thought of you in that...
Stop stop what was I thinking...
"" Not that old--Oh God what have I done?
But let's find out...
Does                         ] that mean we give up!
I'm probably wrong                       ] but you know something it's good                           ] to be wrong.
But we were in the picture                         ] together...

We're just so different.
I have to get up.
Still more to do.
Of course I believe you.
It's so you...
Stop it this afternoon was not what you thought...
Something more interesting than that...
I always knew it would be something special.
I wear this                          ] all year round.
Do you really think I care?
It's been known to happen.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
I should leave.
You probably need your rest.
I hate that--""love you too.
Not all of it but...
Not all of it but enough to walk around...
About ten years a--why...
They make me...
"" I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours.
Do you really not believe in God?
She'll be fine...
Hey--that coffee?
What in the hell did you do that for?
] You're the love of my life and the                          ] end of the world.
What's in that cup?
Never one like this.
Thank you my love.
I should know.
It'll be excellent.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask ""What's your major?
"" I hate that.
You did last night.
Oh I have to hear this.
If I got that money I'd give it all to the poor.
Oh yeah that's it.
I'll do your thing.
How the hell'd you get in here?
Monday morning you're history.
I'll tell everyone about tonight.
You were nothing before you met me!
What's my thanks?
David says he's very so he's very.
Never say never.
We want another look at today's lunch.
Like I give a shit.
I was talking with someone!
Shut up it is.
Come on it'll be Very.
So tonight's the night.
Anyway I can say never to high school.
I've got David.
I think you can.
Yeah I just got back.
People love you but I know you.
People love me!
Just shut up and turn on the radio.
You are out of control.
Yeah she really wants to talk to you.
Fucking A Today.
Give it up girl!
No way no day!
He's in my American History.
God I'm so sure.
Help me to stop it.
Put your hands on your head.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place.
That person could be me.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing?
You're still not listening!
I'm not..
You're not listening!
I'm not on your side....
Let's call the whole thing off...
You were wrong!
I could be up for that.
So are we on?
in the kitchen.
I am out!
Let's just...
Our way's better.
I was just making it more special.
How do you think Mr.
Your son's dead and you love him.
I'll get him back!
Did you miss him completely?
It's come a long way.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead.
Our love is God.
A double date.
Have you done this before?
You're probably right...
This is the last thing she'll ever write.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life.
You got what you wanted you know.
Okay we'll use this.
I say we go with Big Blue.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Moving place to place.
There are no stupid questions.
Can you hear me!
Then get over on my side.
I think so man.
We on tonight man?
Hey kids make your parents and teachers feel like shit!
Turn that back on!
Get a job.
Could we get some more light up here?
Everyone take their places on the stage!
Can I use that.
But my name's not...
That's three things.
Is that a fact!
I'd better be getting back.
anyone want to give me a hand?
Look who I've found!
Come on through.
I'll think you'll find our Mr.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I'm watching my figure.
You have it.
Love you can still write to each other.
Life seems so much not worth the living death such an easy way out.
You have to let me go!
They want me to live with them!
we want you to have a good education.
It's a letter from the school.
You're a child!
You know what can happen with boys.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Come on sit up.
He's the manager!
Got an A Mum!
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
I bought it especially Mrs.
I know it's hard for you being in here but it is for the good of your health.
That's coming along well!
Thank you so much!
It's best not to get too close.
I'm so happy to see you!
Well actually Mummy's left that programme now.
Let's go for a walk down here.
come on Mummy!
I know what to do about mother.
But that's not true!
I've got one.
Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Just a couple more.
Did he tell you?
It's so beautiful!
To be known as He!
James will be there.
I'm so sorry!
Somebody's got to help us!
I mean very bad.
Just get better okay?
Sure plenty of times.
did I ever talk?
I did more then that.
It's like I was a different guy then I am today.
I understand I think.
I just sort of....
Bad choice of words.
You just made that up.
Eighty third most common.
Second most common?
That was easy street.
I've got numbers to back me up.
So I'm done.
The way you just looked at me...
I'm all over it.
What have you got to say for yourself?
I miss my wife.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
It's okay to miss somebody.
It's okay to still love someone after they're gone.
No I need to remember.
Look whatever it is take me off it.
Is it something I'm on that's...
that's making me forget?
There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life.
What just happened to me anyway?
I got to know her life.
And wait and wait and wait.
I had never even met her.
You and who else?
How much time off?
More time off.
Today's my last day.
Be just like old times.
She was all over me yesterday in the break room.
Yeah how's that?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Look never mind.
What happened to you yesterday?
I've been in here before.
You seem to certain she's dead.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
You usually have it up and running by now.
Where's is it?
That's cold.
That was cold...
I realize it must be hard.
But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
In a big way.
You're- you're all over me.
Sorry I just kind of...
Come here you.
Really why's that?
Never to put you in my will.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
In a word?
How does feel to be Mr.
oh my God Oh my God.
THE BABY IS COMING OUT!
I CAN FEEL IT!
It's coming out.
I'm doing a very special thing here.
Why are you doing this anyway?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time.
Okay pull over.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Shut up and play darling.
I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Oh before I forget.
No please make yourself at home.
I did read that yes.
It should all in the report.
Thanks for coming down Mr.
Who the hell are you talking to?
but I'm starting to think I was...
Can you follow them?
Your first year as husband and wife.
Think about people for a change.
People other than yourself.
Part of you must have known she would find out.
I hear everything.
And soon you will know everything.
But I want you to think for a minute first.
Think about all you've seen.
This game is over do you hear me?
One thing you can be absolutely sure of.
And that thing is this:
But that's what I need.
To be sure...
to be absolutely sure...
That's all anyone really has.
Maybe this will make things easier to understand.
And at the end of the day does it even matter?
How can you be sure any of them really happened?
But I saw these women.
I just know it happened I can feel it...
What things do you think you've done?
I just had to tell somebody.
I've done some really awful things in my life.
Things that I've...
what the hell is this...
Your wife is dead and you need to move past that.
And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it not around it.
It's the only way you can become whole again.
That's what we need to do now.
Do you know what I mean by giving in?
in your head.
Listen it's about...
what we did together last night.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
It's getting hot in here.
What's- what are you doing?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.
It's not that kind of date.
No thanks I've got a...
a date tonight-
People watching you all the time.
Waiting for you to make...
It was like I was supposed to save myself.
You better take that ""letter"" there and get rid of it.
he's okay?
It was you!
I thought I heard...
the looks in their eyes...
but I was honest.
I'm beginning to...
be aware of that John.
You should go in.
For two days?
I never really thought they'd go for it.
That's close enough.
Talk from there.
You can talk from there.
Sell it to him.
In bad weather, yeah.
Gives me a little for gas and food.
Children's Hospital, on the double.
It's not good.
You paid it?
""  You're telling me you're the A...?
Some of it.
I got some of it.
I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
How often do you see your son?
A son yeah.
We can hope.
You still have your job right?
He gives a good report and I walk?
I know what he means.
If I go down what's this do to my son?
Do I hit anybody?
I'm a family man.
Take a look at my employment record you got my employment record there right?
Do I have a record?
Have I ever done time?
You and me we're not...
It's not our nature.
You got a right to throw me out.
The thing about kids is they're so...
Bill I got financial problems and...
THAT'S IT!
YOU KNOW WHY?
""  NO FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.
but you let him believe it!
He's in bed!
That's what I'm trying to...
The same thing that always happens!
and you let him down!
Like you let everybody down always!
I'm trying to tell you what happened.
What happened is...
Is he here your friend.
I'm on my way --
Off the record.
You're asking me?
The whole country in fact.
What are you --?
Hey put that thing down.
Turn that thing off.
Maybe when you're older.
Well the thing about life is...
Yeah my dad's great.
I'll see ya...
Point that out to her.
She was always on my case for stuff like that.
She's still like that right?
Thing is I got all this business stuff...
Get off here.
It's just I got some business problems and...
Were you in it?
In the war?
It was this war.
In a fire.
No John you're too hard on yourself.
John I know all about it.
This will explain everything.
There like that.
That's not what I mean...
it's all wrong!
Now you help me up.
Boy you seem...
I thought we just walked through everything...
You did save my life!
I know that John...
you're a very nice person.
in any way...
A couple of...
John I'm sure she could support just about anything.
I think I'll see you to your room.
or use you...
The guy could be hours.
What're we talking about?
You learn to follow the ball.
Jesus did I say that?
He'll do it.
You really-should have talked to him first.
THEY FOUND WHAT?
She's talking to him now.
Did she call him back?
Where'd we put him?
I thought they'd all go ""It's him!
It's a wonderful piece.
I just got...
I saw him out the window.
You were in bed.
when he came here.
An hour after...!
Let's give her a night in New York City.
No dead body.
We'd like to find --
get it on with him?
He's pretty...
Is he like that in real life?
Look at the guy!
There's no face really nothing to work with.
Call him back.
He wants you to call him.
They're great with kids.
They love 'em.
They eat 'em up.
How are they with kids?
That there is your Man's Best Friend.
then look out.
You want safety?
Was that your dad?
They're really white.
Well it's for a woman.
It's really up to you.
Things are beginning to come to a head.
All I'm saying is --
That would be stupid.
And how are things with your lady friend if I may call her that?
It was when they took me out --
Oh good -- well I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Actually I have met someone.
There's a woman I think I like.
in school that time.
I'm happy that you're working again.
And what about work?
-- For you to be in an ""up"" environment.
I was really lucky to find this place.
How's the new place?
I think we should talk first.
Yeah right -- I really have to go to bed.
Can I tell you tomorrow?
Yeah I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Yeah I've always been able to make my way in the world.
Do you have a family?
It's a living.
In fact that's why I've been in the area.
I've been living very close by.
Just show me the way.
Yeah that was easy.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
It's okay baby the police are coming.
-- oh I thought I heard something on the line.
Baby what is it?
Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
It's probably nothing.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.
I've asked him what's wrong.
No I told you.
There's still a lot I want to do.
It's not quite...
You've done a really great job with the house.
Here take this out to the table.
would you like that?
We'll talk in the morning.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Yeah -- we know him.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
I think it's time I came home now.
Look I think we should work things out.
This is for the best you know it is.
That's not the case.
To him and to the company.
He wants to see me!
Yeah -- she did a good job.
I thought we'd be happy here.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I hear things in this house
There's no card or anything.
Do you remember who gave us this?
If I hear anything you'll be the first to know all right?
How was lunch?
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
But it's what we want.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house
I hear what you're saying but I know what you're thinking.
But I still live in hope.
-- You said the right thing.
Not very long.
Put it out man!
Let's follow 'em.
God your sister's really hot.
Get on the other side of that.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Do you see a man?
You knew a second ago.
Can we keep him?
I've told you we'll get another dog.
What does EVERYONE want me to do?
You want to move back?
I have a cold.
I just read your report card.
What kind of report card do you call this?!
All right then if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
We can all get stupid again!
Do you have enough money?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.
It's a double.
Where's the bed?
You can believe what you want.
You saw the tape.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Talk to me about what?
I think it was England.
He had to come from somewhere.
Anything from the bank?
Send it out.
I'd like you to see this.
Wait until you see the tape.
That is news.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
It's called evidence.
Yes -- I think it is.
Most people are afraid of death.
One cut off the others head.
He's after you -- just like the others were.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
I brought you here to talk about him.
She was a good woman.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
I took a walk.
Where were you last night around nine?
Well I have a little home coming present for you.
No -- after you.
You can go first.
You always get to go first.
No -- I will.
The only thing you can do.
You must end it.
So you do this for yourself?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.
Where we off to?
If it came down to it what would you do?
In the end it could be you and me.
As friends -- always as friends.
I'm sure they will.
For being a friend when I needed one.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
There is a whole world around you.
Feel it -- become part of it.
What else do you hear right now?
You've stopped living it.
You look but you do not see.
You listen but you do not hear.
You know what you're problem is?
It is a beautiful day.
Must you do that?
Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Indeed you did.
I am a teacher of sorts.
In fact you have more family than you think.
Do not ask me how.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little.
That you're a good and honest man.
What more need I know?
She'll soon be of age.
Can you really tell from doing that?
How comes it your are not afraid?
Then take me with you.
You'll no see me again.
I thought we agreed.
Sounds very -- normal.
Now I can start to live.
He's in there!
He will not stop until it is over.
It will end tonight.
Where will you go now?
We are the last of our kind.
And the other one -- he is like you?
On the back it has--
--for three hundred years.
What if they were trying to get out?
Let me ask you something else.
Do you know who they are?
In the shop you mentioned something about--
Yes -- it is.
A little -- yes.
I wanted to get to know you better.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
I've lived all over the world.
I'm just trying to place you.
You're twenty minutes late.
We can talk about it more.
You look like you have.
Then how did he know your name?
Who was that man last night?
It's been in my family for years.
Stay out of this.
If it's good advice.
I was at the police station earlier today--
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
I like my work.
I know Paul.
Someone cut it off.
What's that next to him?
We found him this morning.
How could they get by him?
This could be a very important find.
They've had a little car trouble.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
I know-- you would not tell me.
Oh well -- I shall find him.
Time is on my side.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
It's not been long enough.
It's been what...
two hundred years?
After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.
I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.
The world will be mine.
It will not end tonight.
It was not by choice.
What you thought was the end -- was not.
Why did you wait?
No -- I'm fine.
Is there anything else you need?
I'll no forget you.
It's a better place I go to.
It's not for me to decide.
You are only a man different than most -- but still a man.
You feel the same -- want the same.
You want to live.
He has a power--
There's nothing I can do.
One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
Is everything alright?
You kept it?
The money please.
I'm three feet away.
I think he's dead!
What'd you find out?
I'll make the call.
Our people out there they good people?
People in the right place?
I would've moved in when we first found out.
By the end of the day I want to own him.
Who's running the show up there?
He knows better than that.
You should let them know.
How much information is in the house?
You think we should take that chance?
It's three kids.
Watch the back of the house!
I want your car!
All you want is the car?
That money's mine.
We have to give up.
He's probably planning it right now.
There is no way out.
It's too heavy.
Not if they're looking at something else.
Now come here and see this --
Someone should stay with Mr.
Are you totally stupid?
I have to tell you something --
We should give up.
All we're doing is making it worse.
They're already behind us!
We could've gone out the back!
All we have to do is take one.
We're on foot.
What if he's dead?
It just went off!
We got jobs man; we're working.
Why even take the chance?
Let these people go.
I'll give you half.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You've been in there a long time.
What're you waiting for?
If you save his life it'll help when you get to court.
Let me come get him.
Now I understand.
I can make them understand that.
We been through that.
I need you to let me talk to Mr.
You talk to him for a while.
There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.
I'll give you these people.
I got these people!
Call off the house-to-house.
How about your two friends?
I'm running this shit.
You talk to me.
Let me speak to Mr.
I want to hear it from him.
You need a doctor in there?
Look out the window.
You see the car?
What about my father?
I'm getting a doctor!
My father needs a doctor.
Shut up and sit down.
Who else is here?
Jesus get upstairs and find out!
Did he take the kids with him?
You got something to say?
They'll cut the power.
We can take it with us.
It's a safety room.
Pretty sure I do.
Yeah here we go --
Anything like that?
Jesus he works for me too.
That's how we'll get to him.
That guy is fucking us over.
They're taking him to the hospital.
You worry about your end.
What if it goes south?
Do you want to lose both of them?
First my girls.
Now the second one.
You get the other one when I have my girls.
You said they would be here!
They're close.
Let me make a call.
You can see they're okay.
We're here to do business.
You got ten minutes.
I think you got no choice.
We'll trade.
Ask if I can keep it.
I have your fucking family.
So are two of his men.
How did you get this number?
Maybe later we can talk.
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
But they're not here yet.
I should've called.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I still see that boy's eyes.
I need to work out some stuff.
If you get out maybe you can help the police!
You get out and I'll stay with Daddy.
Then we can run for it.
No one's coming.
Now we can do whatever we want.
You'd better get out of here!
How about dog shit?
What I want is to help my father.
You can do anything you want right now.
I'll get your brother then come back for you.
How can we get out?
Do you want to go or not?
I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Which do you want?
It's not like I can go anywhere.
Please get away from me.
Keep your head down.
He said something about a girl --
I need to talk to him.
So far as we know your children are okay.
We have a boy on the line.
Is something wrong with Jane?
Get everyone out here.
Other people can hear us.
What's wrong with the radio?
Could you call me back on your phone?
They might be at the house.
Keep trying and let me know.
Tell her I'm almost home.
I know the one.
Call Jane for me.
One at a time!
Clear the air!
I'm not stupid!
I'm looking for you.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
And now I'm taking it back.
Take a break.
See your family.
If I need you I'll call.
You want me to stick around I could --
Then I think we should wait.
Do you agree?
The whole place would go up.
Order your men to stand down.
Then get your men off the wall!
I've done it once or twice.
Sounds like you know the job.
I want to know employment friends family anything we can find out about this guy.
It's right in front of us.
Where's the office?
The kids are in here!
They've been in there all day.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
What does he have on you?
I know why I'm doing this but what does he have on you?
When he gives the word we move.
I asked you my name.
What's my fucking name?
How do you people expect this to work?
I can tell by the way you move.
So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
Okay here's mine.
They're right here --
Here's a name.
This is somebody's personal tax --
Look for names.
Can you open them?
The office is right across the hall.
Can you get into the office?
He makes me sit on the floor.
I think he was working on them today so they're probably in his office.
I need your help with something.
Is my daddy okay?
They would see you outside too --
I've got the boy on the phone.
What was that son?
That's on the second floor.
How about you and your sister?
Take it easy and talk to me.
Tell me your name son.
A man has my family.
Then you have everything.
You can put them away.
They're still in the house.
Where are my children?
where are they?
We clear on that?
It will be me.
I'll tell you what to do.
When I have what I want you get your family.
We want them.
You can let go.
Can we let go?
We're almost home you and me.
Keep your shit together.
My people are good to go.
You know who I mean?
We who is we?
Paul we would like to speak to you in your office.
The Lady Minister!
Paul Paul a moment please.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
There's more money to be made here.
I will get the money you keep them outside.
I can get it for you.
Give me it.
And four children?
How many in your family?
Name a price.
Why not take some money for your work?
You want to pay me?
There is nothing to it.
Where is your family?
You must open it.
We are looking for you.
I wish I could Paul.
Try to hold out.
No Paul they're afraid.
Paul I need you to buy me a day or two.
You're fucking black!
Hold the line here.
Get him a room but tell no one he is here.
Paul will look after you.
Paul you know who this is?
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
You think they will believe you?
Who will tell them?
If you do not help me you will stay on that list.
I am on a list!
You are on a list.
Listen you need me.
We are better here.
Better to come with me.
I hope we all get to do many things.
I wonder - will I ever go back?
What do you mean General?
They can go where they want.
I'll be over.
Come and I will get them for you.
I'm sorry General.
Please I have money.
I wish I were like you.
I will see what I can do.
The police are very busy.
 What do you think would have happened?
' That's what he said.
I thought I'd better tell you.
They are gone.
But I will take care of you.
I thought you'd like it.
It is clear.
We are half way there already.
Their money is no good to them.

Terrible times Paul.

We have to take the chance.
Also this is your bill for the last week.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
We have to.
Please do not talk like this.
I will meet you there.
What sort of plan?
We have to have a plan.
We are almost out of everything.
We are almost out of water.
Children get off.
Sit down now.
I have to stay.
Go help the children.
I'll try but we have to leave with or without them.
Please please try one more time.
What does it matter.
What sort of car?
Tell me what it was.
What am I worth to you?
When we met...
I hear we must pay for everything.
How much for this?
It is close by.
I have to go out to get food.
I will be there soon.
What for Paul.
Enough of this.
We stay together.
Let me rest I will feel better then.
Get them out.
You could leave Paul.
But who is left?
Listen to me woman.
They are not dead.
My sister is dead Paul.
They would not leave the children.
Please go back bring the children to us.
There is hope.
Give him time.
Have you heard from Mr.
How can we help him.
Please send someone to get them please.
It will do just fine.
Put these people in them.
They will stay in my room.
They can stay with me.
I have done enough for them!
Stay with the children.
What is it Paul.
Then they go.
Send them home.
We are not the police.
I tried already.
I sent them home.
Go and call them.
He was not family.
No I could not.
We must do something.
Let's have dinner first.
Your brother's here?
He told me it will not happen.
There is one thing I need right away.
But if this thing gets worse we must close.
Yes Paul I remember.
The house manager.
Can I have your name again?
It's true sir the water has been turned off.
What is this about no water?
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
I will get you out of here.
What do we do with all these people?
Sir no one wants to work.
Twelve are dead.
You have taken business class?
Paul do everything you can to buy time.
I will call you back.
Paul if you have one call in all the world to stop this who would you call?
Paul are you there?
I have ten minutes left.
What do you mean all?
I do not know sir.
We have a big problem.
Can I go see it?
Dear Lord thank you.
What is his room number?
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
It's not baby.
So what stopped her?
What do you mean he's dead?
It was on my Dad's list of ""things to do.
"" But the House did him first.
No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know things to see people to do?
Not at all!
I own the house my father built it.
And now I just need to get you into it.
"" Where he wanted to put me.
Dead then I'm coming back for him.
Something just must've...
More to the point.
Looks like we're it.
Oh really: who?
-- what was he doing here?
-- she's not dead!
I'm sorry --
Is she alright?
Well until that's found I think it's a good idea we all stick together.
There must be some other way out.
-- I'm sure you did.
You're not my list.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
What are you playing here Price?
You'll be alright by yourself?
And I think that's case --
-- I did: down here.
Yeah what the hell I'll go.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape Mr.
If you know where it is get there!
But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight.
It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
What's life anyway?
The house did.
What's down there?
Nothing can live here.
The first time I saw it I thought it was beautiful...
then it started to move...
then death started to happen...
First the workers..
six in all...
then my father...
Just bad press.
I mean I never even heard of this guy.
-- yeah we did that --
And we get this money when?
Right here Mr.
Where did it go?
He's dead...?
It's okay everything's okay now.
It'll have to do.
What about that other guy?
Or an on-line computer.
There are five of us...
Look these names...
They're all here!
Let's try down here...
I think we should have taken a right back there.
-- listen to the man --
-- you lose either way Price --
-- where the hell were you?
We can do it...
You hear somebody?
And then where are we?
Well she went somewhere!
Start with the name you were born with and we'll work forward from there.
I'm better than that.
I thought she was dead.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Price did that?
So where's the party?
Happy Birthday baby --
-- and who's next on your list?
Asking the wrong person again.
And where are we off to Mr.
-- in the act.
You know everything you do gets me hot.
Then who are they?
Well not quite.
Could we have a word?
Well think again.
No no it's just --
You think this is fucking funny??
I was in the middle of --
Maybe if I --
And then what happens?
Ever seen one that starts at the top?
He was right!
it was a long time ago...
I may have the answer.
Why is no one listening to me??
-- even if I give you a million as well?
-- it's getting older by the second.
Price if I could just please have --
The House does that.
Likely happen to you all.
Then tell me please -- help me...!
Not just yet.
I never saw you --
I was upstairs!
What is it??
There's only four of us.
Then who did??
I was just sitting here -- it happened.
Looked good to me.
How he's supposed to be dead!
He would have been back by now.
This will be the day that I....
And you think it's in there?
Believe me we need to.
I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Price is now.
-- I'm coming --
Keep talking I'll find you!
For the love of God....
Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
It might have been her mother.
Did you find something?
I feel something.
it's there...
There's no need to be.
A few years older perhaps.
Did you find her?!
It's about a five hour drive.
Do you live around here?
And who died here.
What will they tell you?
That poor little girl.
Oh my God what happened to you?
Go to your room!
What about all my other stuff?
She's down...
Can you talk to her?
Well then who did?!
Can I do it again tonight?
Well I bet you they're happy.
My God I heard something!
Take me to her.
She's down.
Good night daddy.
She's in there!
We want you to come back to us...
Lived here my whole life.
What's he doing daddy?
If you want this room you can have it.
I want this one daddy.
Did you see the others?
Can I have this room daddy?
I'm all right...
What's happening!
Nothing's changed has it.
You two are the most important things in my life.
You know I was thinking...
She's gone!
Oh my God where is she!
I think everything's ready.
She has a...
It's nothing like that Will.
knows about this kind of stuff.
Well what power lines Will?
Maybe we should call someone about it.
Well I try to keep an open mind but...
Well what do you think it is?
But do you agree with me?
Well something just happened to the power upstairs...
set up some more things.
I just want to...
I think that's what I need too.
I'm starting to see things.
Or what she was worth.
I wish I knew more about her.
To our family.
new friends new schools...
Oh come on...
we have to get used to living around here.
Maybe good help is hard to find.
I'll have to call her.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I could use a little help.
Yeah they told us this was the best.
I'm not sure but I can check.
What do we do about it?
She's at school.
She might be able to give us some information.
What about the other five percent?
We usually find nothing.
I think we should do it.
Well that's what we're here for.
She can hear you!
I believe right now she may hear you.
So what should we do father?
Now you must listen to me.
It must be from a woman.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
She would call me and I would come by.
Did you know her very well?
I believe she would have wanted it.
Take care of the girl.
Take care of your family.
They are important.
I wish I had an answer.
Think about us.
We're here for you we love you...
It will not take long...
How long will it take!
What are you getting at!
Where is she!
WILL I just want to...
thank all of you for everything you've done for us.
We'll never know for sure.
Well there's no time like the present.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
Did you have dinner father?
We have plenty.
She would hear things see things...
What was she afraid of?
Well what is it!
There's something through that wall!
There's something in there.
Not at all if it can help.
Where did you find this?
So is that what all this is?
Someone have a problem with us living here?
And what would you do?
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.
Not on station time.
And I believe what you say.
I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Boys upstairs get hot.
and you're made.
You wanted a story.
That is the story of my life.
Story of your life could be right round the corner.
I can go by your place.
A real story.
But that's all it is.
But it's just so...
He wants the Box.
So where is it?
This is his first night on Earth.
He wants to close the door behind him.
Then tell me what to do.
You ask all the right questions.
He'll do what he does best.
What will he do?
In your world.
And why are you back?
What I was what I am what I will be...
And what is...
This is me a few years later.
So many dead.
Others went further.
I went further.
And we have to stop it.
Will you walk with me a while?
First World War right?
You will understand.
Do you know where we are?
you have to help me.
You know it's...
For somebody else alright?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Are you sure this is the street?
It's Saturday morning.
A guy I know.
Like real old?
I knew he'd love it.
You've seen the club.
That you found.
What do you mean you found it?
But you know more than I do.
You know something about this box.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
I saw the whole story.
He went straight to it.
He picked it up.
And it got better.
I saw him learn.
but it is good.
You know over to the left you can...
I read a book once.
It was really good.
You ever read that?
Of course I've read them.
You read all these?
How have you...
But I'm working on it.
And it's yours?
You like own it?
I like to.
Is it always this...
That's what I'm trying to tell you!
That's what I'm saying!
He was already...
when you found him?
I'd seen him in there a few times before.
I have to find out what it was.
I know what you're saying but...
No you know you do.
I mean it's not like great about your dad or anything.
No he died before I was born.
Of trying to find out.
Did he used to...
well I've been having it for years.
well I know what it is.
Of course tonight.
Like if you've got a guy there or something...
Look I'll make a deal with you...
I'll trade you.
I'll give you talk.
We met at the hospital last night.
Well what do you want?
left me a card?
At the club?
Yeah who is this?
Can I like GO now?!
It's not my problem!
I was just there!
It's nothing to do with me.
Hold on please.
I need talk to you.
In the club.
Right at the back there.
I'd do you a good price.
Can we see?
Stuff nobody'd ever want.
What else came with it?
Anything still here?
It was part of a job-lot.
But can you tell us anything about it?
Who'd make such a thing?
Everything sold as is.
It came from here.
Have you tried...
You get me in here...
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.
Like I'm not an interesting person.
I'm just not interested.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
Whatever it is.
This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
There're lots of girls here who look better than...
Do you mind if I continue?
Thank you for the drink.
And this is your club.
I really love it here.
All that is changed.
But how in God's name...
Hey that's what makes the world go round.
You've always wanted to.
What else could you do?
It's not the same...
What you did...
And that's all...
It has everything to do with the world.
That had nothing to do with the world.
Not this one anyway.
The same as I.
To hold you.
To tell you it's alright.
And you know I'm sorry.
It's like I must have done something wrong you know?
I mean we've got all night.
Let's get it out of the way.
See how we feel.
Not now no.
Anyone I should know?
yeah it looks different.
But as you can see I'm having some work done on it.
It'll be great.
You know nothing heavy little drink maybe little talk.
Just see how we both feel?
You know I..
I miss you too.
I'm a bad person.
And I really miss you.
of course I have.
Hey it has been known.
I'd like to put things right.
I mean really?
Things are great here.
Well forget about it.
It was so beautiful!
Oh thank God you're dead...
Let's just forget it I mean...
Hang in there...
""But we'll be the same as we started...
That was close....
Why not just go now?
After all they've done to...
But I said I was sorry....
Okay you got me Mr.
Oh, not much.
The hard way.
Did I miss anything?
""Every day you meet quite a few.
Called a watch.
You got about five minutes and change.
You said something about a plan...
I'll have to change them.
"" What's the running time?
My record's eighteen.
I'm not into this.
Hey I'm sorry man.
Shit what am I doing?
look at this.
Just get me to the bar...
It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Oh not much.
That's the first thing I did.
My plan is just beginning.
Her plan is over.
My life is not some deal.
You're supposed to be dead!
What the hell....
God go with you sister.
But he knew Right and Wrong.
That's the best kind.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...
I hope you know what....
Right now you're the only guy.
Without your help I....
You better believe I can.
I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
It's from the machine.
Well what's this?
I-care-for-you...
Does everyone in the world know more than me?
You really went and did it.
With one day not even a day of planning you did it.
Okay maybe it is....
It's also been a long time for me.
Oh I'm so sorry...
"" ""Doing hard time.
How long were you in?
I never break a date.
God I wish I could say the same thing.
And I buy my own clothes.
Actually I wrote it.
Oh you read that.
Never why do you ask?
What are you--How's your head.
Actually he never told us what it was.
Good job not pretty but good.
Easy as my brother's wife.
That's your mark man.
How many times do I have to say it?
What was our bet?
So let's get busy.
We're here to say your government was right.
I got the real deal!
No let me!
Like a ""cat"" one could say.
With your help...
How many people did you break that thing in front of.
Good help's hard to find.
You think you're God.
For all I know you're probably right.
What am I saying you did buy it...
You certainly do.
What else do you got under there...
How was I supposed to know they were women?
Especially after I got you such a nice job.
If you think you're getting past me...
Just shut up and hit me!
If you were a true American.
Why does this have to be so hard...
I never thought I'd say ""I'm just in this job for the money.
If you do anything to my friend...
what's that up there?
If you think I'm doing another...
I Want to make things up to you.
You just might.
The Daddy-Oh!
There's no point in looking back.
My God why?!
Why did he do it?!
I'm plenty happy!
I'm happy enough.
Well maybe I --
How did you know who I am?
About seven minutes.
Well that just about does it!
When you're dead ya stay dead...
I tried to tell you...
so many times...
If you could just...
find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Oh it's you!
You son of a --
No this was my idea from the start.
You mean you know about this?
Never mind about that...
Yeah I think I've heard of that.
What goes around comes around.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What a beautiful thought.
I go every year.
Yes I -- well no I -- I never really...
Certain people are --
Most of them are very nice people --
Oh sure I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
there's something I have to tell you.
You see I'm not really a secretary.
You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Nothing really just...
Oh is that it!
Probably is one of the boys if you know what I mean.
Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
I'm sure I --
Is that all Mr.
The picture was fine!
Oh no really I --
Why yes do you know it?
Mind if I join you?
What a horrible little person.
What're his ideas?
What're they waiting for?
Why not it's all true!
The board is using this poor guy!
Forty-eight years...
How long've you been down here?
I got big ideas though!
On this bar right now!
I was a little funny in the head I --
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Get out of my office!
Out of here!
An example must be made!
I've got a company to run here --
I like to think so!
It's this little idea I been working on!
Is it important?
' How has this come to pass?
Oh yeah the board.
But look I'm president of the company now and I --
I told you a week ago it was important!
Well I'm not sure where I --
Where the hell have you been!
This'll only take a moment.
I was in bed for a week!
He's a little person.
He's nothing.
I'm for it...
I never did give you that--
Oh my God sir!
Up on your feet!
Not that way!
Through the door!
I worked for three years on this deal!
Not even behind your back?
education were you?
You know for kids!
Tell him I'll be right there...
Who let you in?
She's got other problems of course...
She's looking for her mark.
There's one in every story.
Ya get the special?
I got gas.
Yeah tell me about it.
I do my best.
She must have been beautiful.
She looked so pretty.
I know miss.
But I like to do it.
Good morning miss.
If you say miss.
If you say.
But there's nothing wrong with that.
She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people  to help them.
They'll have to believe you.
You mean too much to us here.
Once started it seemed such an easy way to do good.
She never would.
I asked you to let me explain.
And not an easy one --
But how did you get here?
And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you.
I mean do you believe it has power?
So -- he says I'm nice.
But now we've got to get you back there.
I'll walk you back and stay over night.
It'll be a nice change for me.
Believe me Mrs.
This is the first time I've seen him --
I think you need some help.
I've worked with it.
But it's so far away...
No this is quite final.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much.
But I'd like to know more about the case.
That means that you have met all Mr.
You're single?
You will be you are.
You know what she is!
Does she know what she is?
One of these days he'll start on you the way he did on her.
""  What he could do to that word ""beautiful.
Would you mind taking me home?
Everybody else knows it.
Paul saw to that.
I want to listen.
What in the world are you talking about?
I'd better come along and show you the town.
I was just beginning to wonder.
It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Paul is mother's first child.
Paul went to school in England.
-- But you're an American?
My brother's wife.
And that --  is my chair.
I like her already.
You'll like her.
Is she a doctor?
Yes -- on the boat.
But you've already met him.
You want that?
That's past -- that's over and done with...
So far as I know -- it is true.
You turned away from me.
Why should that mean anything to you?
I took Mrs.
I wanted to help you.
""  The whole thing beginning all over again...
Do you love that?
I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here.
Why did you come in here?
I know what you went through tonight.
I often do.
I heard you playing.
Yes he can.
Well I had a good time up to a point.
On your first ""day off too.
I've never given it much thought.
Many people thought her beautiful.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.
Yes, thank you.
Bigger fish want to eat them.
It is not beautiful.
Two things had happened, Mrs.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
And what happened then, Mrs.
It's more than that, Doctor.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
This is something else.
We've had this sort of thing before.
The dead do not come back to life.
Death is final.
Maybe it's better this way, Mother.
But there's been too much talk.
The thing's out of hand.
Of the nature of Mrs.
No -- it's about Mrs.
A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
That's what we're talking about!
All that you say comes down to the same thing.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs.
You're quite wrong.
Tell them what you saw there.
We're all in it.
Say something, Paul!
You've always been good with words.
Say, where's the wife?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Well, we can just --
The phone's out.
Do you think?
Maybe we should call someone --
And we'll talk in the morning?
I'll drive you --
Let's just go on in.
I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
That's not why we're here, right?
I know, I know.
I had no idea --
That's supposed to explain it?
I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
What else could I be?
We're not living in the real world here.
It's a starting place.
Is that what you're trying to say?
Yeah, that one.
Jim left it, last time he was over.
hey, you look nice.
I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Well, I really let him have it!
Dinner in ten minutes.
Hell, I know.
I've got to pick up Paul.
It's just that we've got to be honest.
Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
You have to bring this up now?
Did I do something here?
Is it something I did?
I thought it was --
you were, but, you know.
I think I am...
I'm -- are you...?
You all right there?
I've had my say and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
So maybe you'll come too?
Then again why should she be?
I mean with us with our...
I did but -- somebody should probably see her talk to her...
We should be off.
Stay out of trouble.
All the more reason for this little heart to heart...
You know Paul I've been thinking maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk you know about -- well --
Peter's it's top of the line eh?
I'm fine dad.
I thought you said you and your husband --
Well here you are.
Maybe it's all for the better you know?
You having one?
The boys will be home soon.
You have a point there.
That's a very good point.
I have a husband.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
I'm just not sure he's good enough that's all.
Who else would I be talking to?
And take that thing off!
Talking to me dad?
What do you think we're doing dad?
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Jesus all right enough!
Good-night dad.
Now get to bed.
Dad stop it!
I thought I'd start trying.
But I -- well maybe I love her.
I would have if I'd had the chance.
The very thought --
Actually it's not about work it's advice about --
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice you know --
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
You're forty years old already and --
Sure is good shit.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
Did you make the list?
Hello you two.
It was lovely!
You'll wait?
Well we can talk about it.
Jim maybe we should just go.
I've got to look in on the kids.
Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
it's not the right time to tell you...
Do you think it's all right--
What the hey.
Let's go for a drive.
Pass some time.
You want coffee or something?
We'll see you in the morning.
Or set the house on fire.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Is it a big party?
Well I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days.
Maybe after dinner.
It's not like we're too busy.
For the dinner.
It's really quite all right.
It's not a bother.
You're here...
That I will indeed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
That was stupid of me.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
You ask what the point is?
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
You're saying that Christ is the child and --
They say you never forget.
One for you and one for me.
You are a god.
You're not planning --
Am I right or am I right?
How can you do that man?
Let's see!
Jim he's been out of it since he was born.
Hell we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Would it matter?
I'll take this stuff.
Like a brother and sister.
It's special.
That you give off.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Maybe you should have just a half.
They did it last year too.
How do you know this shit?
Who said so?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble.
unless you really want to.
You get in trouble?
You're parents at that party?
You know only if you want to...
See no one's here.
You have to follow me?
Then why'd you come after me?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
You watching this?
It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Just thought I'd stop by.
They were old.
The ones you built?
Well you can...
That's all for now.
I had him!
And then I lost him.
That's I.
got them on?
Her things are in the house.
You said that once remember?
Then change it.
But here's the thing.
That must have been awful for you.
Happened a long time ago.
Who's playing?
It's the best time.
I could say the same thing about you.
He's up next.
He was there Friday night.
We already did.
She went to a party Friday night?
It's all about the small stuff.
All small stuff.
We'll get the other one though.
What I saw?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.
I think we should check it out.
And something else that might interest you.
I'll call him now.
I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.
I told her to come.
Has her books in it.
Around twelve-thirty.
What time was that?
She left the party early.
Like I said no.
We know about those things up here.
She'd come to me sometimes in the middle of the night.
Are you sure about that?
I was someone to talk to.
Not that much at first.
To talk about my books.
Think about what you're doing...
Keep half my pension.
I wish I could stick it out like you.
What are we thinking?
Every last one.
Cut some kind of a deal.
One word to I.
You know I remember that.
We say nothing.
It goes away.
Simple as that.
On <i>us</i>.
Everyone's talking about it.
He's asking everybody questions.
<i>Five</i> hours.
To do nothing.
You know my plan of action.
When's that a week?
We have to figure out a plan of action now.
You know what about.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for.
""  Can you believe that?
They're all over everybody.
As soon as we got back.
Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
There've been other cases.
A year and a half ago.
One of your cases?
There's a guy down the hall.
That's not what he thinks.
I'm always all business.
Your friend's all business.
How should I know?...
After that she left the party to go to him.
The other guy?
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
She wanted to see me every night.
You heard me that time.
""She was nice.
Did you love her?
Leave us all behind.
But you were such good <i>friends...
Told each other everything.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Knew everything about each other.
I was her best friend.
No back-up.
Where's your back-up?
If you want it to be...
After all I'd given her.
I just wanted to make her stop.
Then so was mine...
She comes to me you know.
What the hell do you know?
But we work so well together...
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
But you wanted to.
She was only seventeen.
Yes down at the station.
Down at the station?
Thought you might find that.
The phone call.
What a pair we are.
You made me look at them with your eyes.
I understand you only too well.
I know what I must do.
You wanted it to happen.
You let them do it.
You must save her!
You have no choice.
Yes I knew him.
You are beautiful my friend.
That's what the one who made me said.
You would never give up life.
You see too clearly.
You see too much.
We can do that?
But you asked the wrong questions.
You said there were none.
Then I leave too.
If you want to save her send her away.
I could give you reasons.
But I'm afraid.
I was waiting for you...
You mean he is...
He knew nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this.
The one who left the old world for the new...
So much you make me feel...
None that I've ever known.
Then there is nothing.
I saw you with the boy.
That is a picture nothing more.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Who made us what we are?
What are we?
You have questions?
To come so far and find so little.
Yes and very beautiful.
I thought of you when I saw them.
Where did you find them?
I must do more than that.
I've brought a present for you.
I want things to be as they were.
Not you my dear.
You need a brother.
And I'll tell you something else!
Tell me how it was done!!!!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
I had a mother once!
And so was I!
And if I cut my hair again?
What you are?
You would be something other than you are?
Which of you did it?
Which of you made me the way I am?
Or there would be twice as many.
You should throw them away.
Is this my birthday?
Why always on this night?
But now he's not.
yes that's it.
I want some more.
And I'll show you how to get it.
We are now even.
Yet you could do it to me!
How do we seem to you?
Drink you ask me!
Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Let him go he said.
So you felt it too!
That's not so.
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.
I can feel it from them!
I've seen enough of this!
And no one knows but us...
They are here.
I know they are.
Now stop this --
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Or her or her - or any of them?
Or you never knew.
What was it like making love?
A beautiful child!
Is that what you still think I am?
Still my beautiful child.
I did it for you -
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Go away from me.
So we could be free.
Then maybe so do we.
He gave me this life whatever it is.
We shall meet our own kind.
Find the one who made him.
Learn what it means.
Never drink from the dead.
He'll never let us go.
Now's the time to leave him.
I took your life.
He gave you another one.
You both did it?
And he found me with you.
You see the old woman?
That will never happen to you.
Tell me why...
you've got to tell me...
It's not finished -
Show me your book.
Why does he call you that?
The way I learn everything.
By watching you.
You have it...
And the more you tried the more I wanted you...
when I first came to you...
not even you.
little by little...
And such lights!
You've come again to me?
You always were the strong one.
she should never have been one of us...
it's alright...
until I am myself again.
She wants you to be happy.
come I am like a mother tonight.
That and more.
Do what it is in your nature to do.
And I gave it to you.
to think you...
are all I have to learn from...
Unless I make her one of us...
You finish her - if you feel so much -
I like to do it.
I'm not interested in you.
Ever think of that?
Does this make you happy?
It will be the sun or the fire.
The sun or the fire!
I'm the only life you know.
They know about us.
It had to happen for you as it did for me!
As did the one who made me.
Consider yourself lucky.
What have you done to me?
But one thing is true of everyone.
See that one?
It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Anything is possible.
But just try it for a week.
We can live like this?
You must get into it.
Give it time.
It will pass.
Dear God what have I done?
You were made for this...
I want a woman.
It will take twenty minutes at most.
Did I hear a yes?
You asked for death.
You really want to be with them?
But why do you want me?
I wish I were.
But if I were what would I want with you?
That's who you are.
You've just done it -
Let's call that a start.
How do you mean start?
We'll start with him.
I want it!
Give it to me!!!
You have to ask me for this.
You have to want it do you hear me?
Death took them.
You're not afraid of anything are you?
And a beautiful house it is too.
What are you doing in my house?
You want death?
Is it death you want?
You ask me for this after all I've told you?
It's over I'm telling you...
But it has.
There is no more to tell.
And all those years I thought he was dead.
But one of our kind?
You found nothing?
He was dead to us.
We were free.
Where would she have gone?
And I had made her that...
And did you lose her?
Did she go?
She had to know.
But why did you tell her?
He knew me.
But there was more to it than that.
Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could.
He did it to make you stay with him!
Shall we go on?
As you would say today...
I can look on anything I like.
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.
The same way you do it.
We love it.
Let me turn on the light.
You really think...
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Well what a lucky break for me.
I was watching you watching me.
I knew you were interesting.
What do yo do?
It's just a room...
Saw you in the street outside.
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
And you know what you ask for?
What the hell would you call this?
What about a radio?
That'll be just fine with us.
Is that bad?
Not possible I'm afraid.
Who is here?
The guy looks dead.
I should go up there.
I should call her back tell her I'm coming.
I got work to do.
Fish are all over the water...
Come on let us take a boat out.
Oh god it's you --
Come on you can make it.
I'm your best friend...
There's no way off this place.
I've got to see.
We'll be better off in the open.
It was the wrong answer.
Sorry we lose.
You saw his room.
I believe him.
They never found the body.
Now get over it.
He's here...
We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
That's his right.
What did you actually see?
I tried to call him.
Am I bad?
Their stuff in there...
and ours in here.
I'll ask --
He does work hard.
He said he'd try.
Try is like maybe.
Try is nothing!
But he said he'd try.
I thought he was just...
It's a fact.
That could break the machine.
And then he came anyway.
Did you tell him I'd be here?
No means yes.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Yeah right -- whatever.
I thought you were out of town!
You know me to well.
Never do that again.
it's not working right.
You're home early.
I really miss you.
Okay I'll try.
Will you try...
for me please?
We probably have to go out again tonight.
And she wants us to come with her.
I'm the one --
I want to go back.
I want to be fine.
I want everything to be like it used to be.
I understand something.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Oh that's Will.
You'd like him.
I got in early.
Who was that guy?
You never do...
How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
Show me the body.
He was right there.
I can tell you one thing though.
He's dead but he was right.
Me me me.
It's always about you.
I'm not doing well in school.
Did you get help?
There was a body!
It's in my room!
No -- it's not that.
it it said...
You sure it's okay with you?
Which is over seven hundred feet a second.
I said this...
This was not my idea.
I really am...
Take it easy on yourself.
It was one year ago...
It was in a church...
it was so real.
I'm with her.
Maybe we should just wait here?
I've decided.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.
Am I right sister?
We will baby...
Everybody says it and it's true.
Where there's a Will there's a way.
Is there a problem here?
Worse comes to worse you can stand there and watch me.
Just for a minute baby.
You know what I want to do to you...
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Yeah a great weekend.
Forget the weather!
To a great weekend --
And that means now.
Well I'm in school and --
Mark in the Morning!
I'm not waiting...
Hell that's worth three easy.
And you got your waiting period.
Make it three hundred.
And throw that in too.
I can go two...
I've never seen a dead body before.
I'm sorry but you could've been the one doing all of this --
He leave you?
What's the matter boy trouble?
I'll go find him.
We'll only be a second okay?
That's exactly who it is.
That old guy knows something.
We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
what's his name?
And do what with it?
Hey -- shut up okay?
They're around...
They're all dead...
Dead I tell you.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking.
So why are you still here?
Yeah we heard.
She's in her room.
May life be good to you both.
Thank you I'll do that.
Then you can watch him.
I'll be working late.
All the more reason to watch him.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
In case you do so would you --
I want the General to see him.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.
The General is here.
I've won often.
My friend -- what can one say --
Let us put it to the test.
Some still do --
She shall not be left here.
Let them think it was a normal  And perhaps it was - perhaps it was.
Perhaps I had better stay.
It is changed - changed completely.
If only we could get away - - you and I.
On my word!
That's what they believe.
You're making it up!
No one can take my father's place.
I know it must be hard.
Tomorrow perhaps before I go?
I could never leave him.
In the morning -- go.
How kind you are.
She has never mentioned her family.
These must be horrible days for you.
Try to forget everything.
I will let him go.
He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people.
I turn my hand against him.
That should decide it or you --
I felt he did not like me.
As a child.
But one must love a father.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I do not know him but I have seen him.
Of course he's nice to me.
What an odd question!
The young man Mr.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
That old doctor in London -- he told me.
That your father and I 
You will not say one single word.
What if he is?
What would I be thinking?
But now -- what are you thinking now?
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
How do you know what my father thought - -
Your father knew it too.
I will see to it that you do not walk about again.
I will watch you both.
You ask that of me?
No I want more than that.
You need not worry.
I have few friends.
He's dead enough.
Woman what are you doing here?
She's not too well.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Her family name?
You never knew.
When you make sense I'll listen.
Listen to what I say --
You are my friend.
You must stay away from her.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
We will know what to do then.
Until we know what choice is there?
We have to stay.
We have no time for that.
It is not necessary to understand.
But that should make you like her.
Oh now  now look here 
You have but one world to live in - the world of today.
She is not there.
Do you mind if I go with you?
Why not Take the doctor's advice?
My only chance is to stay away from him.
Let me tell him.
Well tell him.
Is it the General?
Everything's so simple.
You have no family  no children.
But they're somebody's children.
Times are bad Mr.
A lot of these people are out of work.
All I'm asking is thirty days more.
All right  all right.
Come on we got to get this up.
Sure I have but I got rid of it.
I've been looking all over town trying to find you.
Where's my kids?
All right put up your hands.
Come on out here both of you.
now come right in here Mr.
Yeah very funny.
Well between you and me Mr.
If you know where she is tell me where my wife is.
But where are the houses?
You're nobody.
What else are you?
Somebody's just made it.
Well you got any money?
What's the matter with him.
or you are!
Well I had a car and it was right here.
You have no car.
You've never been born.
That's an idea.
Yeah that'll do it.
You've got your wish.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
I found it out a little late.
Only one way you can help me.
I know everything about you.
That's what I was sent down for.
Well who are you then?
Oh I know all about you.
Go through with what?
To save me?
Yes but George.
Yes but what happened to George?
Well wait and see.
It's a good face.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
What did you stop it for?
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Hey who's that?
Now look I'll help you out.
Well keep your eyes open.
See the town?
What's that book you've got there?
I've been waiting for over two hundred years now sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Oh dear dear!
A man down on earth needs our help.
You sent for me sir?
I know that girl!
They went out of business years ago.
It was up there.
The Building and what?
You can keep him on.
That's the best part of it.
Of course it's the place.
Is this the place?
Just get me home.
Oh look at this.
That's why I came to see you sir.
Today over at the house.
When'd you see him last?
Well sure I do.
Get over what?
Oh Mother Mother please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.
Something's happened to everybody.
Please let me come in.
Keep me here until I get over it.
There it is good as new.
Yeah all right.
I'll give it a drink.
Well what happened to you?
So long George.
Oh this afternoon.
a great big one.
The last time he come in here.
I own the house.
I own my own house.
And all's fair in love and war?
Well then how do you know?
Well how do you know?
Came back three days ago.
Oh it's wonderful.
thanks ever so much for the bag.
It's just exactly what I wanted.
Anything I can do back here?
That does it!
Okay  all right.
Where's my insurance policy?
Yes you bet.
Have a good time son.
I think you're a great guy.
You get yourself an education.
Then get out of here.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Oh well you know what I've always talked about  build things.
I say maybe you were born older.
Maybe you were born older George.
He's pretty young for that job.
Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Oh he's a sick man.
Hello George how are you?
Say where's Mother?
Did you get a doctor?
I hope it works.
Oh well I feel funny enough already with all these kids.
Well it's old home week.
Now let's hear from you.
sure I will.
Say hello to New York for me.
Want to walk to New York?
I know but.
Why of course you can.
Come on in the office here.
George can I see you for a second?
Hey you look good.
She was here first.
Now look did you buy anything?
you can take this one off now.
How does anything like this ever start?
All right now what happened?
How did it start?
I just did but they said you left.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Right down here.
Oh thank you George old boy old boy.
would you do that?
Well how do you do.
Well what do you know  wife.
Some other time George.
You're the only one in town that can help me.
Well what about all your other friends?
He's in Europe.
Not that it makes any difference to me but why did you come to me?
What is it  a woman then?
All right sir.
I'd like to do that.
Sure sure sure.
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
You're not talking to somebody else around here are you?
You know this is me you remember me?
Now let's look at your side.
Young man twenty-seven twenty-eight.
forty a week.
I'll send you a box.
I know very well what you're talking about.
That's what you're talking about I know.
Well I've said too much.
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.
Just one thing more though.
I'm not interested in your book.
Just a minute  just a minute.
Now hold on Mr.
You're right when you say my father was no business man.
And what's wrong with that?
What'd you say just a minute ago?
Just remember this Mr.
What does that get us?
Now I say.
They're not my children.
Well now listen.
well a little.
Well I'll tell him.
Hey that sounds great!
Oh baby I knew you'd come through.
Now here's the point.
Have you got any money?
why not right here?
Can you think of anything better?
Yeah-yeah-yeah.
You have no idea what happened.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh George George!
Oh you're real!
Oh George George George.
Yes I called him right away.
He says it's nothing to worry about.
Was the doctor here?
Just a cold.
The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh she's got a cold.
Left them at the office.
Yeah just started.
You mean you.
What is it a boy or a girl?
I want my baby to look like you.
Darling you're wonderful.
Please let's not stop George.
Just a minute dear.
That does it  come here.
A whole week in New York.
Well of course I like her.
Well then sit down.
Would you rather leave?
All right for a minute.
My mother just called you?
Well how did she know?
About coming in.
Have you made up your mind?
They'd be on my side too.
Am I talking too much?
If I told you it might not come true.
Come on tell me.
Well not just one wish.
Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know.
What'd you wish George?
right on the second floor there.
In that place?
I'd like to live in it.
I love that old house.
Yes sir you look a little older without your clothes on.
Too young or too old?
Why it was only last year you were seventeen.
Maybe I will say it.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Okay  what can we lose?
I'm not very good at this.
Of course you never.
I never saw it before.
Made up your mind yet?
You coming later?
You coming later George?
George sit down and have dinner.
How about that one there?
Sure sure I am.
I'm supposed to.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Find one for me.
It's okay it's okay....
No problem no problem.
We better go back in.
Maybe by now they are.
Quick -- I'm in love.
Yeah it's her job.
Why'd they decide to move?
Lucky lucky lucky.
Shit shit shit!
But we had it!
Oh out a ways.
Can you get us a line?
You coming up on him?
Want to talk about it?
I need a hand here....
It's still there!
What's there?
Look to the left.
Never mind that shit.
You're too close.
About an hour maybe two.
Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Give them my home phone.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner...
Close up okay?
Nine-thirty ten maybe.
What the hell time is it?
He'll do it for me.
I know just where to go.
Well what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.
Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
I just made it up.
It means ""Get me out of there.
""  What the hell's that?
Then check it out.
I'll be in the office.
Happy to do it.
On your own time?
This is on my own time.
Just stay here.
Dad I'm sorry....
You can work until school starts.
Hey come on....
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
You want to come here a minute?
Not till next year.
You stay here a minute.
We've had a lot of trouble.
I'll be careful.
Why on the water every day?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
What else is there to do?
No place special.
Okay okay -- stand over there....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Well yeah I did that's the funny thing.
Here's a test I did....
Will you listen to this man?
Will you just listen to him?
What have you seen before?
It came up during the meeting.
Too late it's written.
Wait a minute....
All of us thank you okay?
Not when it's like this.
So there's one around here.
What makes you think there might be?
Okay so that's it.
But that's what we're here to find out right?
Look at that:
After we've looked we'll talk.
As soon as I heard about it I called you.
This thing is big!
Just one minute....
Hey -- it's not your job any more.
Turn in the car.
I know you did....
I know what I saw....
You've given them every- thing.
Everybody wants the job.
No one wants the authority.
Call me in New York...
What did they....
Not like me.
He's out there somewhere...
You love it here.
Tell me what the hell happened!
Then that's what I meant.
That's great too.
He wanted a job he's got one.
I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Got to run.
Where's my day book?
It's good with coffee.
As far as the office.
Home it is.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
I did I did.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Jesus it's right there in front of you.
Look at this ---
Someone has to do something.
Maybe they are!
It's still a good idea.
In New England?
We all lost on that one.
I know I know....
A real one.
It went well I thought.
Might still be there.
Where the hell is Air One?
If they're not at the light look for them.
Just do it all right?
Sure they did....
They made me go with them.
I'm okay baby I'm here.
It's okay....
You stay with Mrs.
Can I go with you today?
What's daddy doing?
Find your brother okay?
It's all right we're okay.
I told you remember?
Well I'm not doing anything with him.
Now I really want to see it.
Is that me?
I will I will.
Okay okay coming....
Hang on hang on...
They like to play.
We may see some today.
Who'd you ask?
They tend to follow moving things.
Maybe it's gone.
Anyone know what time it is?
They'll be there when we get there.
Might even have a fire started.
It'll take us to the light.
Come on back up here!
With you everything's next week.
Take a break for a minute okay?
Who went out?
Right after the Kids went out?
Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Until we find something.
I can go out if I want to.
You do everything your parents tell you?
My dad told me not to go.
I'm not sure I can.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
We sometimes hang out there you know....
Might as well.
Coming about then.
Would you take him?
I'm not in the way.
Close your door.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Be reasonable please....
Look what am I supposed to do?
It's done it's over.
He thought he had a good reason.
You should've been out there.
What the hell is he doing?
Oh my God....
Let's get them back in the bus.
How the hell do we get him down.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
I'm only walking him.
We're ready for you.
Now that's the end of it!
Go on Doctor.
So you better start.
I'll need more men to look.
Coming with us?
Never know down there.
We'll watch over her.
Only to myself.
I'm the only one that can do it.
You two go!
Somebody better get down there!
That's why they're always moving.
They have to have it.
What did you just say before?
That's what I've come to ask you.
That's just it Michael.
Well that's why you got it.
It's too soon to move him.
He ought to put him in here.
Now come on!
No we'll go through here.
Would you do that for me?
They said you'd be here.
Change your mind?
After what happened to us?
It's never over...
God they're horrible.
Did you see its eyes?
How black they are?
The look in them?
How the hell did it get in here?
It's all right baby.
I'm having too good a time...
Of course I'm coming!
Are you coming...?
I talked you into this?
If I had a mind I'd never have let you talk me into this.
And leave me down here???
Oh no forget it not me!
Let's not talk about that now okay?
I know I built it.
I've just never seen it this way.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
They just wanted to say hello.
They find a lot of things.
They're coming with us?
Okay forget him now.
It's his work.
You called Doctor?
I'll see to it.
Hope I make it through both.
Want another one?
We have to get them out!
He's big as a bloody bus!
How'd it get in here?!
Is there such a place?
Believe me I am.
Get ready to go.
That's what life is Doctor.
But for different reasons.
Why are you?
Just watch it when he does.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Worry about yourself.
Let's hope he knows that.
What in hell is that?
So do I love.
All those people standing in line...
You know how many are born?
Bigger than this one.
I'd like to try.
Well we'll just try again dear.
Keep working on it.
Maybe you'll get it one of these years.
It's no use.
Make this quick!
Have them do some.
Nobody told me.
We're to film him for the evening news.
We got it to live for ten hours.
That's some kind of record.
It was a good try...
We moved it too soon.
And big for his age.
He's a young one.
I think they'll come out now.
Someone's looking for you.
Show him around for me?
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Take it up!
Take it up.
Let's go let's go!
Now what's this do?
Told you you'd like it.
No think of something else.
You're not in the water.
Yes it's great!
He's - he's...
Did you see me?!
You were great out there!
This is where to be.
Check this out!
I never go in it.
Depends on big brother.
Well wait till you see the rest.
I was seeing this guy off.
So you just get here?
What're you doing later?
Yes there is goes.
You never saw anything so big.
Then you can film all you want.
I'll stay out of your way.
You have a man near it?
It's large enough...
Is it large enough?
What I was born to do.
What the hell's there?
Well in that case have a drink.
I will old boy tomorrow.
Our work is done here.
That's how they do it you know.
Make sure you put this back.
All right hit those lights too.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
We'll get someone on it.
This time it's real!
I've never met anyone like her before.
She still talking to you?
Yeah he'll really go for that.
He can meet us there.
Then make up your mind.
If you still want to work with me we'll have plenty of time.
What a job you've done!
We've always wanted to do that together.
Okay you two have a good life without me.
Just find your own.
That's Dad...
Took it this morning.
So was Dad.
How'd you do in school?
Yeah we'll find something for you.
Got a job for me?
You want to show this?
My tea set.
I got my tea set.
But you always let me....
You let your mother think....
It went away....
But it went away...
We would have known....
The doctor said she should be all right...
Where have you been...?
I have work....
Turn it off....
Why should there be anything wrong?
How come it's my responsibility?
I'm trying to get ready for....
There's only so much room.
We need milk....
Make a list.
It sure is....
It sure is good to be home....
Like mother like son....
You should get away.
I think it's a lovely idea....
It's not fair....
He was doing his job....
He told me you both did....
You make sure they come?
We'll be there....
We'll have a lot of time together.
It's silly...
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
Whatever happens next.....
Beginning of what?
It's beginning....
You want to try your hand at something...?
I used to worry...
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?
I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
He knows what he has to do....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
We'll do something....
All of us....
It's here....
You have something to say about everything....
You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
This thing working?
A small one...
A big one....
He heard that.
Ask the big doctor about his work.
Playing in the water all day....
I'm on the phone....
You check it....
I know you can use the phone by yourself.
You're a big girl.
I know you're five.
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...
I see what you're doing....
Will you please stop....
I'll miss you....
Good night Daddy....
I'll be in to read you a story.
I put everything in my room.
The water's coming in...
The water's coming in....
You're silly....
I'm still five....
Your father was six then.
Just like you....
I need to be away from here.
You can stay in my room.
In a minute....
I'll get something important done for both of us....
We'll have a lot of time together Michael....
I'll be careful...
I'll be....
There's a lot...
I want to talk about it....
Why'd you take the boat?
Why'd you come out here?
It got him....
It's all wrong...
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
You looked just like your father...
I'm your mother.
It's my job....
There's nothing to worry about....
It'll work out....
I have to get this finished.
I'm fine....
Trying to write our report....
It's late....
I have my house my friends my job...
My life Michael.
I have to live it.
You just got here....
I'll stay for another week then....
I'm pleased.
None of it is.
Will you let me finish.
I've been working on this all day.
I enjoy his company....
You're having a good time....
You're all I have left...
I want you to give up your work....
So will I....
I'll be all right Michael.
We'll do that before I go.
All you all right?
Come on I'll show you around.
Your brother's dead...
Your father's dead....
There's never been a great white where we live.
From having to go out there after it....
I'm just getting started....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I want you to get out of the water....
It came for him.
Yes you can....
We could take a few days....
You're always taking time off....
I could take some time off....
Stay a while....
That's hard to imagine....
When I was a small boy....
I have two left....
I have two right feet.
You'll be sorry.
All or nothing.
Give it up...
Get on with your life....
No you're not....
It's wonderful....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
I'll keep you out of trouble.
Where do I pull off...?
No one does till they learn....
Sure you can....
Depends on where you want to go....
I know it's coming....
It's just something I feel.
It goes where I take it....
Can you just go off...?
First time for everything is the best.
After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I can do whatever I want.
Yes I can....
Something no one else knows?
Like my mother.
I'll get it back next time.
I'm too young for coffee.
They had them on the big one....
Get her started....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
I'll keep it busy....
You sure you know how to do this.
She said it was coming....
What do you mean it'll find her?
She'll never find it.
When we find her we'll radio her position...
You got a better idea...?
We'll buy you one.
We're having a party....
What the hell are you doing down there?
What's that....?
Mind if I cut in?
You too Michael....
I'll get her.
Jesus I miss them.
Would you talk to her?
She's had a lot to deal with...
She needs time....
I wish there was something I could do....
She has good days and bad...
We'll be done pretty soon....
I know how you feel....
Get it on me....
I have to....
The big picture...
Just like taking a picture.
If we're real lucky it'll eat itself....
Drive it away....
It'll work....
All the time....
I've got to get to her....
You told me what?
Know the words to this one?
Money's gone...
We've got it made....
It was so big....
How come only me?
You know I was thinking about yesterday.
Just get the hell....
I'm coming...
How close is it?
If he comes back I'll hear him.
You'll have time to get up.
Maybe it's gone....
We lost it....
I see him around....
You must know something about him....
Bring her about....
Bring her about.
You think he's not good enough for her?
If she was my mother I'd send her home right now.
What's so funny about that?
What do you know about him?
One day he was just here....
How long has he been here...?
As long as he's been here....
What she's got.
And it's always worked?
Lots of times....
You sure you've done this before?
So did I....
My name goes on that report.
There's never been one down here before.
we got it together....
we're done man....
You got two of them...?
We've got a job to finish...
Gave them the day off....
We've got us a great white Michael.
Oh it's okay for you but not for me....
Money is money....
Maybe I missed you too....
Put me down....
I missed you is all.
I'm sorry about your brother....
I made them man....
We're being paid to see where they go...
You want to be careful how you talk to me...
You should see....
I'm training to....
She's in management....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Happy birthday darling.
Now wait a minute...
I'm being serious here....
I told you....
Here it comes....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.
In a few minutes....
This is supposed to be your party.
They're not giving milk.
Anything to do before I go home?
Well with me it's all right.
You know with this show.
Now get this...
Who is -- who is telling you?
I-I-I-
Yes she will.
Ha ha ha ha.
You see Mrs.
I'd rather please you than anybody I know of.
We only got one..
No my mother's..
You better stop in..
I'll start at the top and work down.
What if we need a back up?
It's twenty of three.
Where's your watch?
What exactly you doing John?
they're really pretty..
He can fire me.
Everything you say sounds reason- able.
I'm asking it.
And you know why?
Is that good enough for the ""committee?
So save yourself saying it.
Not many people could do that in a place like this..
Look at the shit you're putting yourself through?
Let somebody else worry about it.
No God Brother.
No I think you'll find I looked like he could have?
You looked like you did?
Did I say he did?
Did he shut you down?
Listen to me saying what?
's exactly the same.
You want me to stop the car?
It's not your friend.
To throw out of the window.
What do you want it for?
Pay me and I shut up.
But where's my money?
She might remember something?
I think this one could be it?
That's how I feel about him.
How'd you do it old man?
I was exactly like you are..
Seven thirty-five..
This is ""God's Country John.
Not for me..
Who is who?
Yeah, he can go...
We give it one more hour.
I think you're here all day.
Well, go on, get on with it.
You need some hands up here to look..
Did you bring it with you?
Bring here her..
Alright you got it.
And did they?
I never asked if he could ""see.
I'm talking outside the girl?
Three or four.
She left of her own free will..
You got no case John.
It could be anyone's hand.
I'm not telling you what to do.
Yes Sir I think they maybe.
Hair on her hand.
How do you know her hair's black?
Did he get you the job?
Is this normal?
Week or two.
So read it!
Alright I gave him the case?
I may have said some- thing.
feel like I'm getting close to this guy..
As she's a member of my staff may I ask what this is about?
What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now.
It's not as bad as it sounds..
I'll take her there tonight.
Not right now..
It's not possible right now.
I'll take care of it..
Which is what?
Just your age.
I know what you're like..
Have you known her long?
Yeah that'll do..
I know but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember.
Really not well.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
There's no one ""looking at you""..
The only person looking at you is me.
I feel like everyone's looking at me..
Of course I would..
I'll get my things.
No just a minute or two..
Have you been here long?
Is there anything else you can tell me?
Anything about him or her?
Can I see your hands?
No it has a mind of its own.
You never said that on the phone?
What makes you think his name was John?
You must have some idea about him.
What kind of friend?
Was he a boy friend?
An old friend?
Well I think I told you on the phone..
I been told to take your car in Sir.
I told you what we know something else you- 'll be the first to hear about it..
we got a body part.
Now you know as much as we do..
You think John would like it?
Think he still thinks about her.
But not like then.
Two or three years ago.
He's not that bad of a guy..?
You want something darling?
Well that's who she is.
I'm sure he is.
Friday night at City Hall.
This is a drive-by.
I got an hour..
You know what everyone thinks?
Sure I put it in the paper.
"" Well give me a fucking break!
Everyone in this building is saying it.
Hey we're not talking ""talk"" tonight.
I think I've found a hand.
I think I found some- thing horrible Sir
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
His father's the manager Sir.
What we got?
He was waiting for you Sir.
Said he'd go down and take a look.
's just gone down there..
I'm already walking.
You can drive down there Sir..
I can make this work.
I'm not trying to make history.
Listen to me it's over.
It's over --
What was our deal when we first got together?
It's not ""love me.
Everything's on the fucking run!
I have to finish my job --
Could you just stop moving?
You lost your head it happens.
I'll drive you.
I meant something else.
When do you want to leave?
Okay this is working.
All of them everybody.
I'll have to stop.
""Something in the way.
It's big.
I see what you're saying.
You had me at hello.
I was good in a living room.
And now I just...
I missed my wife.
So this break...
is a break-up.
There's no question you'll be friends.
Of course you'll be friends.
A nice long break.
I sort of know it by heart.
What if it's true?
"" I mean come on.
Why fucking not!
I did this.
Tell me -- let me help --
It's not fair to you.
Why do you love me?
Well when you wonder ask me.
If I said that would you stay?
Go back and read what you wrote.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
Fine I just --
Oh hell yes.
Wait here a second.
Do we really want to do this?
I have to go in.
Why are we even talking about this?
Maybe you should call her.
I mean the other night was...
Yeah what happened there.
He said ""happy?
Well good evening.
I'm like...
Sorry about this hand.
And I am...
-- especially one like this.
We will be fine!
I can get jobs --
Do you have something to drink?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Better now than later.
We'll still be friends.
Where's the little guy?
Okay have we gone over everything?
Back on Tuesday right?
Happy for us...
Here's the number.
Happy for us.
Well I'm happy for you.
We are so very very back.
We're set.
That's yesterday from the other office.
No that's fine.
But I mean really...
No no I know --
Give me your number.
I'm just a little.
Wonder what he said.
you know it was two in the morning and...
No I'm just...
"" See you later.
Well take care.
Now what did you lose?
I work in your office.
Oh tell the story.
I love him for the guy he wants to be and I love him for the guy he almost is.
Please if I start talking --
That's the girl I love.
He just lost his best client.
At eleven at night?
He's coming over.
Of course I know --
If you'd read what he wrote you would have left with him too.
You are a single mother.
That about says it...
I love everybody man.
I love my wife.
Do I know everything there is to know here?
I'll give it everything.
We decided to stay with you.
But to me --
I missed ya.
You made it --
You play with your head.
Not your heart.
In your personal life?
Well friends can tell each other anything right?
Are we really ""friends?
That's an answer.
You want an answer?
I'll give it to you.
I'm sorry I asked.
I'm asking you as a friend.
Not everyone has what you have.
I'm trying to talk to you.
No you're --
I'm asking you a question --
Why are you even here man?
You could have told me all this over the phone.
Now go home to your wife.
Take care okay?
Hey that's my word okay?
Well this was another way to go.
You never had The Talk did you?
You know when you know.
Oh I know plenty.
you got ME.
Good deal man.
I'll get you some quick work --
I'm strong in my mind.
I'm out here for you!
Help me help you help me help you.
""Love me love me love me...
No I'm saying to be --
That's your word?
""  It's the...
Did you tell him about the ""ten million for four years?
Another drink please.
What you get me.
You are not allowed to act this way.
Twenty-four hours ago I was hot.
You feel bad about your baby girl?
Why did you leave the mother?
I might call you later!
But just you saying that?
Makes me love ya.
Okay I understand.
And it might have even worked too.
I came all the way here for that?
At last I find you.
""Show me the money.
It's a very personal very important thing.
I go across the middle.
And yet nobody's giving me LOVE.
Alright we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know.
Which they do.
And we're standing there.
And she knows I know.
And we're both good at that.
you're right I'll know when I see him.
Why is it so easy to talk with you?!
I have to ask.
Keep the phone open.
Oh God I'm --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
What DO you stand for???
And say what?
I'll go back to them.
How can I make your life better?
You'd be my only client on that team...
Always always always.
-- and I'll get 'em.
You'll lose.
Can you get past yourself for a second?
You did this to yourself.
""  You put it all on paper.
You did this to yourself --"
I came here to let you go.
I better go to bed.
I think I might have some time on my hands.
Let's go right now.
I want to tell you more about my dad.
I'm not your brother!
They do my brother.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
This is how you play God.
A lot more died.
I would completely support that.
And who knows?
He could have died.
He needs you Paul.
He needs us.
I should have tried.
That thing took him down this way!
Can you see him?
You'll be right behind me.
He must have had it on him when he...
When did you have it last?
I'm sorry that you have to be here.
We have to help him.
He's this way.
I had no right to...
No it's...
And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
We can cover twice the area.
Twenty twenty-fire pounds.
How much weight have you lost?
We called everyone did everything we could.
"" You believe that?
They never came back.
What's a bad idea?
He says it's a bad idea!
From what I understand it's pretty much whatever we want.
You had the phone the whole time?
We need to stick to the plan.
You see that's just the thing.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad okay?
then we should...
I want to look for him too.
We have to keep looking for Dad.
Just hold on.
Thirty-thousand I think.
I CAN GET HIM!
You're no better than the people who built this place.
We need to keep moving.
Who knows what else they were up to?
They never got that big.
If you look out the right you can see...
That's the nice thing about them.
They never run away.
This is lucky.
Even with what I pay you you could get a better bag.
But you told me otherwise.
But you're the still the best.
You think they could talk to each other?
The way they can work together as a team.
I try not to.
You remember the sounds they made?
What do you do there?
So Mark's working at the State Department now.
He used to know me.
He's three.
Go back to your parents for a minute would you?
that brought you here?
The lady you called how do you know she can help us?
But then you never get to go in space.
You do one thing wrong and you're dead.
Do you have any kids?
Then we go home?
Mine's new.
I use to have one.
Know what this is?
And like to me the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
The important thing is we both made it.
That's something we have in common.
Is that all it's been?
The first one.
I read both of your books.
They'll never make it.
But you never came across just one.
You can stick with us or you can go and look for him.
No I'm sorry but no.
Sure you have.
You wrote that book...
One of them was a Green...
No one else has come close to you.
Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight?
What can I do for you Mr.
You hear something?
When he comes back he'll know we're here before we have a chance.
It certainly does.
We were saying?
Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Now I actually make things.
It has to be light it has to be strong --"
I've been putting this together for over a year.
And they did.
You were right -- and I was wrong.
Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?
Why did you want to see me?
When you have a lot of time to think it's funny who you remember.
Are you looking for a problem?
Is that who we're really working for?!
We've got to see one to find out.
Is there any --
Are you all right?!
Where does it say that?
How could you possibly?
You've been training for that for a year.
I could come with you.
Richard talked to his parents.
Well is he?
That was about a year ago.
You know at the bus stop.
With the hair?
Your mother tell you to say that?
I'll make it up to you this summer.
But I'll be back within a week.
You only have to stay with her one night she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Let it go Peter.
Far end of the street.
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.
How close do you have to be?
My father's.
You can keep it.
Why and how are my business.
What's he got in there?
People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
The guy's completely out to lunch.
It'll hold!
What do you think they want?!
What do they want?!
Get in the car before they hear us!
Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
They're all the same.
Our chance to do what?
Then this is our chance.
I went up there to live.
So that others would know about this place?
Why did you come here?
Once things go bad they tend to stay bad.
They go to hell together.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.
They will come after me.
There we are -- your baby is free --
GIVE IT TO THEM!
Can you set up?
Where do you think she gets it?
WHAT ARE YOU-
Whether or not you feel lucky.
Do we go on?
That little black line?
I believe in him.
You go if you like but we're not waiting for you.
MOVE IT OUT!!
We have to send someone to look for him!
It may not come back at all.
I will not do it.
It could have been worse John.
It could have been a lot worse.
It's not worth taking the chance John.
You're sure we have to?
Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
How long will this take?
What exactly does this mean?
Two million - - great.
That would help.
Oh good that'll take no time.
I got an eighteen minute window.
That's up to your guy on the boat.
Make sure he got it right.
How am I supposed to transport them?
Oh I'll get 'em all.
Anybody at all.
Feel free to speak up.
You see something?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.
You can go with the others.
There's only one way to be positive.
Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
How long does this stuff go for?
You never had control!
You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces.
Once we have control again we - -
You have to feel it.
They'll all be fine.
Out you come.
I know my way around a kitchen.
I'll just finish.
Yeah I want to finish.
That's what makes her sick.
Not just every six weeks.
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
We're out of a job.
How did you do it?!
How did you do this?!
We were right!
He said he's- -
They were wrong.
They're totally wrong.
What kind of park is it?
Why would they care what we think?
And what are those?
Oh my god they do not!
Cheap cheap cheap.
Well not one of those well yeah a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.
What's so wrong with kids?
Yeah I know you know...
You want to have one of those?
Five six feet high.
Look at the - -
This is looking good.
If they died together they lived together.
They died together?
such a small area.
Like hell it is!
We can make it if we run!
We could put that into effect!
Do you see anything?
The other car!
That's the way it happens.
Especially the big one.
That one - -when she looks at you you can see she's thinking  working things out.
John's plan.
Here it comes!
Stand on it!
Please - - chance it.
Can we chance moving him?
The same way.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
I get ah - -
Will break through.
The insurance company - -
Then they're expensive.
Put them back.
Are they heavy?
Where did you find those things?
Up and down up and down!
What are we looking for?
I hear it's nice.
Sure they will they will.
Two thousand a day ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!
John we - - what I'm just saying....
So I can see them!
Let's get something straight John.
And I can shut you down John.
I hate it up here.
Get down right now.
Come here girl.
Come on try some.
It's so strong!
It's a great name.
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
it's about fifty feet.
Listen give me your hand.
Can you move?
Which car were you planning on - -
Oh yeah - - great.
You're sure?!
The kids okay?
Their radio's out too.
Yeah they hate me.
This happens all the time.
We've stopped.
I love 'em.
I love kids.
Anything at all can and does happen.
You got any kids?
Ah - - they're here.
For a further three years.
Not to put a fine point on it your kind.
Well I'm afraid I do.
Not just kids - - for everyone.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
You ask for it we got it!
I'm coming to get you!
One two three - -
Do as he says!
The power is coming down quick!
Look life found a way!
It's okay!
They're just doing what they do.
Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Oh I hate the other kind.
No we're okay.
He left us!
I want you to stay here and wait for me okay?
Let's get you out.
Wait a minute?
What do you mean ""worked""?
Everything is still off!
You're all right John You're okay.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.
But this is nature!
have anything to say at all!
well there it is.
I certainly have!
There's no debate...
I really will not.
You're right John.
Everything's my problem.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.
But they are your problems.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
The power's coming back!
That was great!
Why did you do this?
I'm sorry - -
Turn it off!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
We miss you.
listen when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
We need seventy-five.
I want to look at the rest of the house.
I really think we should go back...
Help me with this.
You learn something new every day.
I've been trying to figure it out but...
I think we're lost.
I think it's this way...
he's here...
this is his house...
It's still on.
I know how this sounds but that's what happened.
Think about what you're saying.
it's all right.
Now try to think clearly...
And this hand...
Where's my client?
Therefore we have to try everything.
I think it's our best bet.
But I think he's a free man.
For the moment!
You've only got about two minutes left!
You take the left side I'll take the right.
We're down to seven minutes.
About ten minutes.
How long will the effect last?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
And if he's not?
Think it'll do any good?
You know how to use one of those?
There's a couple hundred thousand people there.
He could be anywhere.
I wonder if --
and that boy is sitting right here.
How's that possible?
Just keep talking to him.
I was there once...
that was enough.
but I think I can do it.
When can you do it?
run another tape on him and see what happens.
Add it to the list.
It's as though there were two people in that room...
I think I understand...
Well I'm onto something more useful.
He's my client and this is important.
There's nothing to see here.
we record it.
That's all that happens.
Come on I'm buying.
That's open to debate.
Well that's it.
Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
how does that help us?
but that's not what it looks like to me.
Not much here.
that's about it.
You've told me all I need to know.
So what are you saying...
back from the dead.
None of that's true?
Well I definitely feel sorry for you.
I always throw that in.
What is it really?
You work in the insurance department?
Only the people.
What was the matter with it?
No no no -- quite a long time yes.
Have you worked here long?
Yes -- we do.
Yes -- that's us.
You were his friend.
A true friend would do it.
It's my last and final one.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
A man must eat --  And drink.
My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.
Not for other people it's for me.
Where do you get your ideas?
-- In what sense?
Who's to say he ever will?
I've never seen him.
No I left it in his office.
I gave it to him yesterday.
And you're late!
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're just doing your job.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Sorry yes -- well -- thank you sir.
Was there something else?
In a small way.
You must make the time.
Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
To do my work well I have little time for --
You wanted to see me sir.
-- Listen to me --
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.
No -- not this time.
Just as I did.
As they let us do.
But only for the moment.
It's easier that way.
I know there is.
For now you're the last one in their way.
They're dead now.
We can get help.
They were to come and check on it during the night.
I knew you walked this way to work.
I wanted to find you before they did.
-- you did get away.
I've heard of it happening.
At the cost of others?
Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?
I have no right to be I know.
He read me some of your work.
What we try to do...
is make them a little less so.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.
Are you free tonight?
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?
Two or three months that's all.
As long as it's on their terms.
He would have.
You were his best friend.
A better friend than me.
Have you looked?
I've never seen you here before.
Oh -- well I thought he once mentioned --
Why would you suppose so?
Maybe it's true then what she said.
Unless you have something more to add.
He had no family either.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
Since he came to the office almost three years ago we've been quite good friends.
Eight -- and seven months.
We left the office together.
When was the last time you saw Mr.
Nothing is given to me.
-- Just doing our job.
-- You should meet my father.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
It should take years off her.
Yes well -- we're looking for a new village now.
authority I could see.
And I find you.
A piece of paper...
Your friend Mr.
Then he only worked on the one case.
I did read that.
All these in the last year?
It's gone out so quickly?
From the insurance department
""  Where have I heard that name?
It usually is.
Then that's the place for us!
What's to become of us now?
It's too late for all of us.
They'd drive us away.
We could go back to the office.
We've been together too long.
It's not too bad working here.
Women are all you have on your mind!
It'd be good for them and good for us!
It'll be good for you and good for me.
Take to look out there..
- Have you seen what he's done?
How could you do this to him?
you took it.
you're father is dead.
Sun's coming up...
it was fifteen years ago.
You'll never see me again...
It's for my father.
-- Where are the others?
We should never have come!
You are most kind.
Pleased to meet you...
Pleased to meet you!
Thought I'd head out west...
Go back to the wall...
) They are now.
Look at the size of that!
You get to save the girl and I get my third act!
Yeah I saw her...
Did he come around often?
Please we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Well she's not now.
Oh you've got to.
And how do you like our fair city?
It's so --
Well -- well I'm just back.
And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Sure dear yes.
Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I said that.
Well so you have a choice.
He must he's paying for it.
All right the money.
All right not the money.
A kind of put-on.
It gets things back together.
I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel you know brought down.
You think people hate you.
From other people.
I do not love him.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Well I have to close up now.
-- I have to close up now.
I've looked at him a --
Like for you to look for the man.
If he was me he'd know better.
If he was even a city boy he'd know better.
Is that what he set me up for?
Everything he's told me from the beginning?
No that's not --
What was better?
Well we're pretty --
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
A few more days.
We know who did this.
I just want you to tell me.
I said yes I see.
Within the Company.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Will you let me go then?
Does everybody know can you tell me?
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
-- We can talk --
Yes -- all right --
Can I carry something for you to the car?
Can you use these?
Look why should it be yes or no?
How can you not think so?
You know the things I can do.
You wanted to or you are?
Let's not make a thing of it.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything.
It was just -- you know everything all of a --
How do you know how bad it was?
Where'd you spend last night?
I need some stuff.
You said it was over right?
You said not to worry any more all over right?
Go down in my room.
Right back at the start right?
My God I thought it was over.
And here I am daddy right back at the start.
Listen to me: It's all right.
Oh look what he did in them.
You see he was nice to me.
Is that all you have to say?
I saw Mr.
Oh boy say you think you're pretty good.
The things I do.
The things I could do to you.
I mean different but still.
But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
We did this before.
You get the Christ out!
No you can find some other way.
Explain it to me.
No no you're right I'm sorry.
Is that how you want it?
Well it should; that's death.
How can you do it to yourself?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
I thought maybe you'd left town by now.
But if it's someone else I do.
What the hell do you think's the matter.
I can make that in a lunch break!
You could help me find her.
You know the people.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Well what're you down about?
Is it more just having power over someone?
Tell me -- the other night watching me with Mr.
Not much point to this is there?
It's kind of late.
Yeah you got to me.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it.
No I said what did you think.
You said it was!
Try some other ways.
Is there anything more I could --
You told me what you could.
You said you wanted these.
Well -- she's dead.
But that's not why --
Is that what you gave him?
Figure three hundred a week from each.
Well let's go down and ask him.
He never told me.
Well do you think it was him?
You've changed your mind?
You do want to play?
Oh he was my old man.
I have some names the police gave me.
Will you tell me what --
How else do you meet them?
How would I remember?
-- Someone else gave --
Most of them.
Someone gives your name to someone else?
What about everything since?
-- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
All right yes I had been.
Could I ask some questions?
No I'm look --
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
He wrote you some letters.
See you tomorrow night.
No I'd -- like to be in on it.
Just send me a money order.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Tomorrow evening nine.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money.
When are you meeting the man?
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night.
I've been after it a long time.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Anything from that?
Very important meeting tonight.
Well as a matter of --
I read your report.
Well there's a couple --
Sorry we had to meet here.
How is it back there?
It's got to make sense some way.
I better keep looking.
Then close the case.
I'll be back next Thursday we'll talk the whole thing over then.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Do they have the report?
It's in the report.
They never did really.
I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people.
Would you like to know what's in it?
John how are you?
Would I be telling you all this?
All she wrote.
Between the girls.
Two years ago?
I'm looking for a man.
She says you sent her on it.
I'd like to make something clear.
I've just got a few --
Oh sure they try.
The idea of a better life.
Men in bed.
I think she's trying that.
Did she talk about him to you?
Why do you want to know all this?
Then how are you involved?
And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Nobody's seen that.
I left them here.
I was doing some work here.
How come he got to play with this one anyway.
What else do you know?
But what reason could he have?
What possible reason?
Thought it might.
Think this is our guy?
That's how the other one died you know.
He's right you know.
But New York that's - well --
Yes sir we know he --
He has a great many ideas about the case --
Very well I'd like to see him if I may.
At the moment I am seeing no one.
I'll see him in there.
He's in his room playing.
Where is the child?
Why would my daddy hit me?
In real life when does he hit you?
Tell me does your daddy ever hit you?
What do you like best about your daddy?
What do you like best about her?
I see you have people there.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
And I'm very lucky.
Well that's what he does.
Why does he decide?
I'll tell you what we'll do okay?
Just you and me...
What did you do when you were little?
No she never did.
Can I sit in it?
Is that really your chair?
It's my name too.
She would like to talk to you.
See you in the morning light...
It's okay son...
Just a little more to go...
See you in the morning light.
You mean for good?
I want my...
I hate you...
Not on your life.
Now listen to me young man.
Then eat around it.
Will she pick me up after school?
I told you before very soon.
You're absolutely right...
I'll bet I never told you that.
Now then the first thing we need is...
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine.
Well you'll have to do better than that.
And his father is here.
I was getting more and more...
I needed to talk to somebody.
Tell me Mrs.
Did you wish to?
How long do you plan to live in New York Mrs.
I have no further questions.
Look I know he had problems I understand that.
I've got problems everybody's got problems.
And how did you find his work?
Eight almost nine years.
Now then Mr.
almost four now.
It's the Friday before Christmas.
The position's been open for two months and...
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....
after the first of the year.
Well this looks very good..
And then four very difficult years.
How long was that?
Would you speak up Mrs.
Somewhere in between.
Well I can certainly understand why you left him.
I think I'll go talk to my son now.
No more waiting in Coffee Shops...
Only can I still see him?
He's yours...
After I left...
And I did...
And I won.
it was just another ""should.
Okay I'm here.
Now why did you--
I never would have brought it up if I thought--
I never thought he'd use it.
Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
I've been through some changes.
You're the one that walked out on him remember?
I want my son.
I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street.
You want what?!
The reason I wanted to see you...
You've been living here in the city?
Watching my son...
You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
A few times.
Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
Who would believe it.
How's the new job?
maybe tomorrow maybe next week...
maybe a year from now...
I'll go right out the window.
I'm a terrible mother!
I'm an awful mother.
He's better off without me.
I really tried but...
I'm not taking him with me.
My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
It's over finished.
So we've got problems.
Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
They'll be ready on Saturday.
What did I do now?...
My check book--
they're not very happy and...
I mean what I mean is...
ah let you go--
None of it.
All right Jim.
You said I was running this show right?
Well what the hell is this?
It's not even close.
I think they're kind of interesting.
This whole thing has happened so...
just in case...
She'll be back...
I've never been better.
Jim I've got to go.
I'm already late--
But it's not a year from now is it?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.
""like"" you a lot.
""like"" me okay?
Maybe if it was a year from now maybe things would be different...
There's something I ought to tell you.
He's a wonderful man...
a wonderful man...
All I was trying to do was--
Every single thing right down the line.
what's so terrible about that?
I'll tell you why...
I'll tell you exactly why.
Yes I'll have dinner with you.
I thought you ought to check them out.
You've got that look.
I'm here darling.
Tell him I asked for it Friday.
I want it Friday.
I lost him?
I believe she does.
How old is the child?
That's if we win.
If we lose you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
First there's no such thing as an open and shut case.
Look she walked out on her own child right?
It's just beautiful.
How often do you see Mr.
She's the mother.
She wants what?!
I plan to have something within twenty-four hours John.
John there's some- thing I ought to tell you.
ah situation has...
I lost my job.
They've set the court date.
I just heard today...
Your boy is very lucky Mr.
I just have to be by myself for a little while...
I said maybe.
What I mean is ah...
Well we're thinking about...
I mean actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
You heard anything yet?
I mean if anything happened to me he'd be okay with you.
He's okay...
I told her you're doing a
She ever ask about me?
Not for a couple of months.
All in all he was a pretty good husband.
No not really...
He'd still be my husband.
That stuff about ""Till death do you part?
""  That's really true.
You're on your own understand?
But let's get something straight right now.
I know I went through it.
But I'll tell you something.
I'd like to know one thing okay--just one little thing.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.
You can set your watch by it--
She's got a wonderful home--
well she told me a lot of...
ah things about the two of you.
But if you want to know what I am.
I'll tell you what I am.
And I just want to know one thing okay?
Just one thing...
That's all I want to know...
She must've said something.
I walk in the house and before I can say ""How are you?
"" ""Did you have a nice day?
"" before I can say anything.
I came home tonight.
Do you know what that means?!
Do you understand what that means?
It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I worry about them.
No one can stop them.
Not even me.
I am ready.
And that day your father got better.
You were a beautiful baby.
I will buy them for you.
Where will you keep them?
I do now.
Can I do anything I want?
Not the way to talk to people.
It is alright Father.
It depends on the quality.
So far they do.
Are you General?
It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
Then we shall meet.
He is coming to meet you.
Yes but they say he did.
Let me tell you current news.
We do not know.
I will be back in a few days.
I miss him too.
I miss my brother.
That day the father got better.
First break of day.
One night you stopped all your moving and I said to your sister ""His time has come.
Your father had been very sick.
Far far away.
Where will he go?
I accept it.
Not until you are eighteen.
I am him.
Do you have money?
Do I have money?
You could buy them.
I will not go.
I feel sure of this.
And things change.
Maybe not right away maybe not soon.
But I believe this -- things will change.
We will work with what we have.
"" And then the radio went dead.
Has anyone died?
We have several hundred in the area.
As a free country.
Ask whatever you will.
I need to know what you know.
You are the man who wrote this letter.
You must know what to do.
I am only a boy.
When it is time.
Will we ever be in war?
This war is almost over.
Will we be in this war?
Not very big.
Is that big?
Of course please this way.
Please come in so cold.
Yes I am aware.
I leave tomorrow.
The kind my mother used to make.
A wonderful history.
Do you think I must?
I have one more piece of news.
A baby is coming.
You will always!
But you will always be here?
One day you will not be able to come running to us.
He was always nice to me.
Well some say.
It's not for you to worry about.
Is he a bad man?
I have news.
He will come back to you you will see.
So my mother did this and a few years later a new boy was born.
I will miss you.
Am I running away?
You will not come?
Who else would be here?
But I have no experience.
Then I am lucky.
I am still too young.
This is Britain.
I would not know.
I want to run down the street.
Eat from the shops.
I want to go down there.
As you say.
It is a story you decide.
I have more men.
You just stay over there no there!
I want your land.
I take it.
It may not be your decision to make.
How could I ever leave?
I remember too actually.
You'll get sick.
They think I am on their side.
Am I Him?
It is a difficult situation.
We will be lost.
Look for a kind heart.
Much too young.
He is dead now.
Do you know how your husband died?
can the police stop them?
But it was all...
Oh well I'm sorry.
Keep coming just like that.
It happens when I land.
Then do it!!
how could he get here?
Could you please cut me down?
His head was just...
Was he a good man?
With you it makes sense.
And you like me.
We'd only just met.
Wait just a second.
Just those two.
He's got nothing left.
But he's definitely coming.
That's actually the easy part.
How would you get him on land?
We both know what they'll do.
We've all seen it.
And I think I know a way to--
Well you can try talking them into that if--
He never said ""go"".
At school they'd always say ""go"" first.
everything's even.
Nothing's real.
What you just did...
Will you miss me?
You think about that?
If he's here I'll find him.
So I was thinking...
You found anyone in yours?
something meeting you.
But we do.
If I'm ever in New York...
Take it home.
They should be here by four.
Thanks for the...
To get in the middle of something?
Does it show?
I got some stuff for your cut.
Like little children.
you look good.
That's probably good.
I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
He thinks they're what?
We're up at six.
I'm sorry but you're...
That was an awful thing to say to me.
I'd be able to see something.
If one could be out there...
If there's one out there...
Same thing from Fish And Game.
I'm not making it up.
We better take him out.
He's done.
I'll take it!
Other than to eat us?
So does he.
Obviously I was wrong!
You said nobody came in here!
Otherwise, we're done.
We made the I.
, our job is finished.
I'm ready when you are.
That it's about to go wrong.
Such a simple idea and it's working.
What does that tell you?
They're coming right in.
Look ten feet into the water.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Could you cut me down?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
I asked you to be nice to him.
I just let go of it.
I thought I saw...
But somebody said that name was taken.
It looks black and...
It's just that--
I got nothing against--
And this is how he came to the boat?
I can look at dead things.
This is a little different.
That's where they keep them.
Is the dead guy in there?
He was pretty much dead.
It has nothing to do with--
Get me out of the office for a few days until--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
I'm not even a field person.
Part of our research--
This is what we do?
I want you to go there.
It's ten after nine.
I actually have an early lunch so...
I mean I'm...
Yeah that part.
The somebody else part?
What was that last part?
I was working for you when ""us"" started what's--"
You work for me.
That's not what you came to say.
I had a great time last night.
I should get back.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over and and...
How did you even know where I was.
He knew her...!
The first girl taken but the third body found...
Where is she...?
"" What does he mean?
Where were you all afternoon?
It's God.
Just remember to call him ""God.
But you've got something...
The other officers will be here any minute!
I have to leave this room just for a minute but -
Get me out!!
I'll get you out!
Shut that dog up.
Get me out!
GET ME OUT!
For the third time!
A pretty young woman to turn him on?
And my does he hate us!
Let's make this quick then.
I've got -
But then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them.
Maybe he just meant to...
I can find it by myself.
If I could just -
How the hell did you get in here anyway?
He gave you - what?
- just wait for me.
It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
- or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number?
They know you're here with me...
Be gone before you know it.
I bought the house from her two years ago.
I think we may be yes.
I have his card somewhere.
I may have seen her I'm not sure...
Who are you please?
What's the problem Officer?
This was Mrs.
I could be there in -
Sir that's great news.
And where he is.
We're on our way now.
Here - take it...
I can go anywhere I want to.
Not thinking he knew her.
You've got to send me!
Picked over, ten months ago.
You heard them.
I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.
They'll use their best men.
Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
But you are...
Go back to class.
Leave Bill to me.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr.
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Then I'll try.
I think he means it, this time.
I think he'll deal.
But if he knew we have so little time -
You seem pretty sure of that.
The other girls are in the ground.
I'll do it if I have to, but -
Can we check back on that?
They look at you to see how to act...
You did well in there.
Well, she's not local.
Looks like town to me...
You used me, Mr.
You did fine work.
Or what I found there.
And he's getting better at his work.
Tell me what you see.
Good idea but he thought of it too.
No this one is different.
This one has seen us coming...
This new one today...
Why not what can they do?
On your own time outside of class.
Now carry on.
They found him at bed check.
Sir what is it?
There's something you're not telling me.
Do just exactly that.
Sir that's a field job.
And I've got a test tomorrow on -
He mentioned a name at the very end.
You sure you've left nothing out?
And what is that sir?
Just do your job but never forget what he is.
Who's the subject?
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.
A job's come up and I thought about you.
Top quarter of the class.
Sometimes you do.
I mean better places then this?
Where does Mrs.
I'd like to talk to her.
Did you ever work with her?
I believe you know each other?
I had no food or water.
It was very cold.
I thought - if I can even save just one...
but he got so heavy.
But you could.
First I tried to free them...
What set you off?
You started what time?
I'll listen now.
You were ten years old.
Later, listen, I'll -
This is all the time you'll ever have.
All right, then tell me how -
That's his nature.
Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...?
Then tell me how.
Whatever his name is.
Tell me the rest now.
Nobody sent me.
I came on my own.
Just until you get your view.
That's enough I think.
How would he test?
He's tried to be a lot of things I expect.
Did he try to?
How long did you live there?
But there's the problem of his size you see.
Even if he were a woman he'd have to be a big one...
I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
My mother - died when I was very young so my father had become - the whole world to me...
After he left me I had nobody.
I was ten years old.
The death of my father.
I tell you things you tell me things.
Not about this case though - about yourself.
And what else...?
They all were.
What I want is a view.
I'll give good value for it.
And you like him too.
Next time I'll have to check.
Oh dear no...
Who can say...?
Best thing for him really.
"" You wanted me to find him.
You could get that for me.
Do you know something about him?
How did -  It's nothing.
But I will make you happy...
Then please - do this test for me.
I would not have had that happen to you.
And you'd hate to think you were common.
How about it...?
Or maybe you're afraid to.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.
How many women has he used our Bill?
I'm only asking you to look at this Doctor.
I am, yes.
Would you Doctor?
That would be so kind.
And get back to you.
Just show me the ones you've turned away.
It's such a game with these people.
Let's go with it.
How do you play?
Can we rest soon?
We leave in the morning?!
I have nothing to go back for.
Will you go back to England?
You're strong.
I will find you...
no matter how far, how long it takes...
I want you to go.
In this there is a chance.
If I live, I can try to free you.
Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance.
I can do nothing.
Whatever happens you stay with your father.
If that happens, stay close to your father.
What would you have me do?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
What are you looking at, Mr.
You are right, Mr.
We do not understand what is happening here.
Many wrong ideas about the government of men.
No man is better than any other man.
I do not remember them.
I was one or two.
Why did they turn back?
And ""do not try to understand them.
""do not try to make them understand you.
You knew them.
I have seen the face of war before Mr.
Let us go miss.
I know exactly what I am saying.
You do not know what you are saying!
There was no letter.
There was none!
Take her and get out.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
It was as he said...
I am certain of that.
More than ever before.
Will you consider that?
Some say that's the way of it.
: Only one or two loads.
This is it as far as we can go...
Do you hear me sir!
into British hands...
What white water?
for the white water.
Only chance we got is...
Who were these people?
He never set eyes on her before today.
Day and a half  Where did you get...
Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
Got a reason to stay.
You're not coming with us?
So each man make your own decision...
We'll see in the morning...
That we did.
Is there another way?
It is the only way.
You forget yourself!
Easy for you to suppose.
I'll have none of that!
What did you see Major?
He saw what it was.
That's all sir.
It was a war party.
By your leave sir.
But that's the way of it here.
The decision is final.
To come and go without so much as a ""by your leave.
Things were done.
Only twelve miles away!
He could be here day after tomorrow.
Find your man sir!
You have three days.
What a place for them...
on the George Road.
Right - about face!
Thank the men.
What is enough?
This is not good place to stop.
That where we stop.
Where is that sun?!
Other than that ask what you wish.
Be careful with it.
Was there such a thing?
They found this?
It could be a million things something in the air food....
Put this on.
You mind if I take a look at this?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Just get in yours!
Where the hell've you been?
Can you see it?!
I am thinking man!
I am thinking!
Can we stop it?!
Shut down the line somewhere?!
I thought they were your friends?
We're getting out of here just in time.
I was just talking to him.
I saw him move.
Look at my foot sir!
It hit me!
Where are they?!
Less than an hour.
How much time does that give us?
Maybe they already have.
He sent them all.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
I need more light on that Four.
you did the right thing.
You did good...
Oh God she's out there...
Shut up all of you.
I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
I'd really have to show it to you.
It's just a day off.
He's not at his station.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Forty-eight hours!
Twelve hours no big deal.
We should know something first thing in the morning.
What're you saying?
We could be there in a few hours.
its your decision...
as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Made your million yet?
They'll make somebody go get it.
I say leave him in there.
He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Take it off and let me have a look.
almost got you.
I'll take my chance down here.
You let him get away!
It's got him!
I want out of here!
That's in the contract.
especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Turn down the music.
So that's all you do?...
Ah it's just old like me.
I feel it too...
Someone's trying to get out.
It's moving!
You're on your way somewhere all right...
What the hell you play that stupid game for?
I do man.
That's a beautiful place.
Getting some food.
I've done this one before.
How'd you do that?
We're simply concerned about her...
How far away is she?
It saw us!
How many times I got to tell you.
Are you sure you saw something?
The air's stopped.
Oh man that's just great...
It was in him!
It's got him.
What on earth's the matter with you?
I'll check the control room.
he's really sick.
I heard him last night.
What's wrong did you miss me?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Look what's this?
Seven hundred for the pair.
How much did you part with?
Well it's still a good idea.
So my friend what fucking good is that if we need it in six.
no five days?
Yeah but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
It's hit us all hard!
He'll care all right.
Pass your phone.
Jesus there's lots of everything.
It's happening tomorrow morning.
Get back here now.
But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
You ask him if you like but I would leave him to it if I was you.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
I am not fucking interested.
Now stop fucking around.
The others the old ones?
There are no others.
Where're the others?
If it looks old it's worth money simple.
Good you can get this under control now.
All right all right so we can say he is good.
Careful remember who's giving you this job.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know.
Who we doing this for?
Oh thanks very much.
And there had better be something there for us.
Well I suggest you speak to him then.
I have got something for ya.
Well for your boy actually.
I think I can help you as it happens.
Should I have something for you?
Good job Chris.
The opportunity was there.
In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Yeah it's all there to the pound.
Er yeah sure I'll have 'em.
The boys had 'em.
I have been busy and I am nearly there.
Did I say speak?
You may speak.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You had better be careful.
Well it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Well you had better go and get it from the office.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office.
Very fucking funny.
Where's what I want?
Made a few quid did ya?
Now where is it?
All right Dad.
That should take care of that lot.
Try that one.
It's not him Dad.
Let's have a look shall we?
Is he on his own?
About twenty minutes.
How long has he been in there son?
I got the money to pay for 'em.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Jesus I have heard about him.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.
Wait until they are well in then give it to 'em.
Shit Dog there's a lot.
Er well yes we do.
It is too late for you to start thinking John.
What is the point in that?
That's the last bag?
Yeah one of them's out.
There's no one there.
It must be this one.
And it better bloody not be.
When the job is done we'll come straight back here.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
What do you mean never?
Well what have they got it for then?
What they like then?
Out the back.
I mean it there is only three of us here.
There is only three of us here.
All right all fucking right I am coming.
We have work to do.
There's nothing in it!
I think we should go and see him.
I hope this is the right move.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
That's it all done we are off.
And look what happened to that.
I thought about that and...
Well what do you want us to do about it?
Well that depends on how you look at it.
I can afford it as long as I see it again if that's what you mean.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
I'll only be a minute.
Now I think we should go.
What do you mean me?
You're supposed to be getting some rest boy!
Why what's up?
I want to talk to you about that.
That you boy?
For half a million?
That's if I want to see you.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
You will what?
and is there something else you want to say?
Never mind son you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
You got it all?
What and I care?
This bar is mine and he has nothing to do with it.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
I want your bar.
I like your bar.
What do you think I am doing?
Now shut it.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Well perhaps you can help?
No I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.
Hello can I help you?
All right let's forget about them for the time being.
I want to look fucking mean.
Seven hundred each.
They look nice I agree.
Jesus if I pick them up will they stay in one piece?
Where did you get them from?
Never mind that now.
So I've just got to put you in and I am off.
At what exactly?
Go on look.
You've already been fifteen.
Er well twelve.
How many feet?
What's left over?
What you telling us for?
The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
~ Never mind that what about the money?
What have you come as?
Just shut up.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I'm not talking to you.
And what did she do?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I think you can learn whatever you want to.
That makes it okay?
You knew how they got all those things.
If you decide not to go on to college--
Leave your sister out of it.
You'll find out when I get you home.
They all been real straight with me.
Might as well use us.
Why do you think they let us in on the ""deal""?
I do sir.
Do whatever they tell you--
Work hard be good at your job.
Do whatever they tell you.
It's their country.
You really want to know sir?
And that's the job?
The--the officers.
Who's ""they""?
Do whatever they say.
What exactly do you think your job is Private?
I-I can do the job sir.
Will this go on my record?
So you knew this young man before?
I'm very happy to hear that Private.
No question about it.
That the word on our boy?
Thanks for coming down.
I take care of my boys.
It's your deal.
You imagine having that much weight on top of you?
He says so himself.
Best part of the job.
Same weight I always was.
You look good--
And you're in--?
He never asked her.
My mother said he never asked about--
Where'd he get all this?
I never met her.
I been here with him eight years now.
You've been in this house for a while?
If it's too late--
Come on in--
Hey it's the General.
So that's him--
These are our people.
So how come you got into all this?
You know who I am?
Go out through the back.
I'm pretty much moved in.
I finished that.
I thought we already had this out?
I'm talking about people here--men.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line.
The question's just been where to draw it
So why should a man?
Made some money came back here--
You own this place?
This is the stuff we picked up the other day right?
The rest of this is all.
It's a.
You met her family?
You live in a place you should know something about it.
You could take it--
We should just do it.
We been through this before--
So where does that put us?
I bet he would.
Take that pair over in the corner--
Good deal you were born down here then.
I meant on the post.
Have we had trouble there before?
Why would you want to do that?
And people make their choice--
Over the years this is the one place that's always been there.
I hear things too.
Boys say they heard he's a real hard case.
Been that way since before you were born.
It's a bar.
You get much of that in here?
Better let me take a look at that.
[No problem I've got another.
[What's your name?
We've got her.
Come this way!
I'm lost--]
He used to be a doctor on the other side.
This girl has a child?
This is the mother of my child--
This girl is a friend of yours?
They need help.
How could you bring them here?
You have somebody else out there?
What are you doing out there?
[Who is it?
Is very beautiful your car.
Hell everybody heard that story a million times.
That's not the whole story.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living.
I was just telling a few about your old man.
He had a way.
Seems like we have another one every week.
And the ten thousand?
But hell what's that?
You got a problem?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen eighteen years?
I got an idea what happened.
Quite a do the other day.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father.
You have any idea who might have put him there?
He still living?
I believe he was.
What's he got to do with your body?
Been there for a long time.
You go by your old house?
Never heard from him again?
You told me one time it was true love.
I'm not available.
He's available you're available--
All my mother does is work.
You got to be interested in somebody.
All you do is work.
It was just that boy--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
It was different back then.
Nobody's too busy.
I was too busy.
There must have been somebody.
Why would I want to go there?
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
If you spent a little more time training them--
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
And my father?
You had to deal with him in running the club.
We run that twenty-odd years.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband?
You ever play one of these?
Yeah that's the story of my life.
I'm not open.
What was your deal with him?
Could of been.
That was white people's business.
And that was the last time you saw him?
Oh my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
I only went for my last two years.
Enough with the clothes--
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Can I get this?
You got in late last night.
Well you were working there--
She made me lunch every day.
So I've heard--
Your father tried to do good for people--
I had a still.
How much you got left?
Everything that went before all that stuff that history--the hell with it right?
If I met you for the first time today I'd still want to be with you.
I'm not having any more children.
He paid the hospital bill when you were born.
Try a year and a half.
Couple months before I was born--
You have any idea when your father died?
What was your father's name?
I've felt that way yeah.
Like your story is over.
How long have you lived here?
More I hope.
You know the other day you asked why I came back?
I mean what did we know about anything?
That's who we were.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class.
They've got me.
You've got your mother your kids--
Being left out on your own.
It might just be the age.
Your boy there--
I remember him watching me once.
When I was little--before you and I--
Most people did yeah.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Want to take a walk?
I'll go check on your boy.
Got him here?
You'd do a good job.
and all--they asked me--
I've got to talk to somebody.
I been working on a few things.
You're out early.
I think he knew the girl before.
We pretty much running things now.
Our good day has come.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Just doing my job.
You're the one who's a good boy.
Be a good boy now--
And people better clear out of here!
What's this I see?
That the problem son?
Hell at my age every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one.
That and your mother.
Would you buy this?
You sell much out here?
You remember that.
Why you think that was?
Have a nice evening Mr.
Tell him he can keep them.
This was enough.
I'm out of here man!
Yeah he says that all the time.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Any idea what it is?
I hear Mrs.
Like in nothing.
I've heard a name.
They go together.
I told you --
What about death?
What do you mean ""all of us?
Why do I know that name?
It's him...
You'll do more.
Maybe he'll show you.
If he was just a man like me then no.
But he's not.
And that took time.
Why did you wait so long?
Like the look of these?
I made them myself to set him free.
He's with us...
And are you afraid?
You've seen the future.
I've got to help him.
Get him in here!
And they all came...
I was so afraid.
Some or it.
Make them see things.
He was the real thing right?
It was more than that I think.
That's what he used to say.
I told you-
How did it go today?
I get to spend some time...
I think you probably can.
I'm sorry I got into this too late.
Come to the show with me.
They love him.
When do you want me to start?
That's not what I'm asking for.
And stop it from happening.
Will you take the job Mr.
He could have been something more.
Maybe a lot more.
But people get lost.
Even good people.
Too much money
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
I want you to help me help my husband.
I know he's in some kind of trouble.
It's better he's gone.
I'll get the number changed.
You saw this?
Will you be there?
they believe you.
Bad show last night?
Are you planning to go back to New York?
Are you finished with me?
He got up and walked.
New one on me.
Let's see him.
What were you doing up there?
I'd like to hear them.
Oh I've got plenty.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
I heard he was the best.
So could you walk on water?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Let everybody think it's over?
It was mine.
I tried to pay you off.
You paid off the doctor.
You want more money is that it?
When will she be in?
I'm afraid she's not in.
I like to know why things happen.
You need to stay busy?
If she wants me off the job I want to hear it from her.
It's not a bad place.
Never call him that.
When I can afford to lose.
You know of him?
So who is?
Maybe I just bought it.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Then what do you want?
I need to speak to you Mr.
About last night.
What are you my mother?
It's one in the afternoon.
We have to agree what's real and what's not.
What's her problem?
But just the last month or so she's worse than ever.
I saw it on the news.
There's something terrible...
You have to walk...
Have you been in?
It's not a business.
Are they all in the business?
Who do you know?
I'd love to...
It was just a matter of time of course but it's not good for the business.
I'm in from New York.
I know all the kids coming up.
Where'd you learn that?
He did something with the ground.
In my time and nobody else's.
We're shit.
He's better off this way.
They got here before us.
Who else did?
I saw it with my own fucking eyes!
At the end...
He had something.
It's like a public service.
Gives them something to wonder about...
They'll never find out.
But not as cheap.
He's coming back.
And he's dead?
Who's not?
He's not!
If I think about it he'll hear me.
He'll find me.
He made us think it was over and done with.
Only I forget.
I forget things
But until then...
it's you and me...
the way it always was.
The woman has a new love in her life.
Your friends are dead.
Nobody's left to save you but me
Why would I want to?
You could still help me do that.
I should have been honest with you right from the start.
He's got...
got into my head.
All you have to do is...
Yeah I'll stay.
I'll talk to you later bye.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
These people are paying you a lot do you think you could consider it?
Yeah they told me.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
I'll bring it down.
Well I mean it more now.
That's what you said the other night.
So where'd you go today.
What do you want to drink?
No we'll find something around here.
Yeah look at that thing.
We should get you to the doctor.
Oh she'll love it.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
I know but that's what you like about me.
and they were never around...
it's so different there.
But it's great being with them after they can talk and can do things with you.
that changes everything.
Did that help?
It's hard.
But I'm mean.
You'll figure it out.
It does the more you know who you are...
But look at you.
No yes it does...
Does it get easier.
Oh for her show?
No I was looking at you.
Do you remember when we met at the bar?
No its easy.
Is that so hard to imagine?
I see them every morning.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
I know it's stupid.
Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I'm here for the week.
How long are you here for?
No how about you?
It takes a while to figure it out.
I'm sure you will though.
Oh what do you do with that?
I'm not sure yet...
actually I was in love with her sister first when I was twenty-one.
that's a long time...
Are you still in love with your wife?
Try twenty-five.
I'm not really doing anything right now and we have some friends who live here.
Do you want to-
Yeah I'll be fine.
I want to eat better.
Is there anything I can do?
I love you too good-night or good- morning.
It's four in the morning...
Well that's good I have to get the kids off for school.
Can I call you in a little while?
Yeah its really different here.
That sounds great  can you hold on...
He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
I wish I had seen it.
Do you want I send it to your room?
It'll just be a few days.
Are you sure you have to go?
Are you sure you want to stay?
Oh the record company sent these...
that's nothing someone gave it to me.
Its bad for you.
But I like to...
Do you think it's done?
Yeah I think you're probably right...
I got some hair stuff.
No what are you talking about.
Maybe I'll walk down with you.
How'd it go today?
No I thought it was funny.
I'm not but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
call me when you get back.
Oh it's nothing...
I better go I'll talk to you later.
lights for hours...
So great to meet you!
We're here for the week.
What're these?
This is the person...
you were talking about?
I believe in you.
No of course not but I think now that this has happened a lot of things can start to come out...
Thank God he did.
When did they find her?
Hey what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Peter where are you?
The book again.
You never said anything to me...
Do you think they have a room here?
What time did you make it for?
It's exactly...
Peter are you okay?
He asked to go home early.
I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
You have to tell me who did it.
George come in.
You should know I never felt Mr.
I think I should join you.
Everything I did I did for you.
I love you Peter.
Everything you said everything you did.
Now it's our turn.
It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...
You're right but it's funny.
Listen to me Peter.
Something he said just before...
Given all that's happened I understand.
Where are you in death without it?
You know how I feel.
Looking lovely as always.
So if Christ won that means what does that mean Father?
We won that's right.
Thank God you're better!
We've only got a few more hours.
Father I'm right here.
Just open the door please.
Oh thank you thank you so much!
You just call?
Well I know he's come here before.
Like right away.
The last time can you believe it?
How much time do we have?
And what's that mean?
""But this shall you deal with them.
He was trying to tell me something.
So what does it mean.
Peter at the very end I think Father was back.
I saw it in his eyes.
It's in the car.
Plenty of time.
What about after?
Get rid of me.
I would've...
Maybe that's my problem.
I was in the water.
I needed a way in.
You have to say that.
I see things.
You need to know something Peter.
There's nothing else here.
Peter what time were you born?
My birthday's tomorrow.
Hang on get it up go on higher.
When's your birthday?
Peter let go of the chair!
What's the...
We needed to know all we could.
What are you looking for exactly?
And if what you're saying is true what would happen to me?
You father is not who you think he is.
He's your mother's only brother
There's no reason why you should.
You are that man Peter.
And the point is?
Please the children.
Well why should I?
You might not believe me...
So what'd I miss?
There was nothing?
Nothing on it.
You gave me the wrong one.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
what did you think of the tape.
Well I think it's very simple.
if you want to meet him.
On television you seemed so sure of yourself.
What's that got to do with you?
Well then it all seems to be working out for you.
Listen I'm sorry but I'm running late.
And also that...
Do you work in the building?
You coming from the party?
I saw you on television yesterday.
You were brilliant.
and you are?
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
Sure of what?
We need to be sure.
We'll do it your way.
There's nothing to be done until then.
We need all the help we can get.
A lot of good that'll do.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Can you meet me tonight?
Good seeing you again.
That these are also numbers.
But does this mean anything to you?
He can see you Thursday.
Good of you to stop by.
I'll have more money than God.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
If you believe in God.
Had to let her go.
It's another day.
I think I'm alright.
Thanks again for everything.
You can go home.
Find out who he is.
He could see me.
He's looking right at me.
I've heard it before.
I meant to call...
Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
Maybe she is.
He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Yeah you met her?
But it's just a game.
He's still at the bank.
I just want you to enjoy being beautiful.
In between all the other things I have to do.
That's not funny
I'm lucky I found it.
Oh all that work.
Which one for tomorrow?
How is she alright looking the way she does?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
The doctor said it was okay.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
I've been running around all day.
Oh me too.
Well thanks again.
This was really nice of you.
You want the job or not?
This time get your feet set.
I mean I'm having a good time with you...
That was two words.
No I mean I can check it for you.
You're cold?
I'd love for him to get a good education.
You just have to get back on the court.
Like you'd get back on a horse.
To do what you love.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
You'll be back before you know it.
You might be the only one with a job.
It means a lot that you came by.
Why are you up?
Yeah once I cut them off.
They ever love you back?
Too many times.
You ever been in love?
Let me worry about your date.
I told him you looked like me.
How'd you get him to say yes?
And he's fine girl.
He's in college?
This brother from my college.
I found you someone.
You have a date yet?
You need to.
I was upstairs for a meeting.
You lost your head.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I mean look at us.
How's that been?
Yeah four years ago.
So they fire me.
Well what do you know.
Just wanted to say good game.
You were trying to make me look bad.
I was just playing ball.
I've been starting point the last two years.
What's up with that?
And what happens when you lose?
I mean I was lost.
But that was five years ago.
I moved on.
One-on-one.
I'll play you.
Better late than never right?
I know I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
I heard enough.
Why do you keep asking me that?
So why'd you give up ball?
Maybe go back to school.
or trying to be better than him.
I'm probably you know busy.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
I never did.
All I know is I'll be back in six months.
But you can sit.
No it looks good.
Just something I'm trying.
So that's it just forget about us?
Few days ago.
When did you decide all this?
And who knows where I'll end up you know?
I mean whatever I did...
I'm not asking for us to be together.
If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Never had to.
The ""man"" again.
Yeah sorry about that.
I had this meeting with this guy.
Hey what's up.
Maybe I'll come by later.
You want to go talk?
You ready to go?
Who's nobody?
It happens right...
Sorry about your game.
I've been trying to find you all day.
I mean I can stay a few more minutes.
I'm not up for running into anybody.
You're not stupid.
""  Man how stupid am I.
What has he been to me?
Like it was easy.
I wanted you to.
My court I go first.
Give me the ball.
What are we playing for?
So how about a little one-on-one?
It's okay little baby.
I said fine.
You do see me standing here right?
Whatever big head.
What'd it say?
I know right?
It was on my bed when I came in.
Can you just...?
When'd you get this?
That what you think?
See you made it.
God here we go.
So she's honest.
Look big head I'll be at your car.
You're stupid.
Man forget you then stupid.
You do act different.
He's alright but my Dad can take him.
Same number and everything.
He works at a bank.
Your Dad play?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I just can.
Told you I was nice.
Give it yourself.
Well can you give him this for me?
How you been?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
What's that not great?
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family.
At one in the morning?
I got maybe two years left to play.
I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
I got a meeting.
We should head over.
This is just about money you know that.
Said he'd be home later.
Still the man.
How was your game?
I found it on your floor.
We still have to go?
And now I'm paying for it right?
That what this is about?
""I told you so?
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago or did you forget?
Look I'm busy.
After five years.
Came by to check on you.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Still is so let yourself out.
I'm giving her some space couple days...
No you need to hear me say it I'll say it.
I mean it's not true is it?
now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.
there's this thing out there.
You came out early.
Get an education.
You know people.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
So you up for a game later?
I care about the school.
Boy what'd I tell you about using that word?
I'm telling you right now I'm fine.
What's this guy's name?
So why call me?
Oh that's good.
I'm sorry did she make it?
I'm here I'm listening.
He's a very sick man.
Are you there hello?
Well what's the situation?
Your mother wants to hear from you --
Please put your clothes on please --
I'M NOT YOUR BABY I'M NOT YOUR GIRL.

Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now.
You're the one.
You're the one who's wrong.

I want to sit.
I'd like to talk to you.

Oh my god Jim.
Jim that was so --
I wanted to tell you that.
I wanted you to know...

You're a police officer.
You have so much so many good things and you seem so together...
so all straight and put together without problems.
-- no like what what do you mean?
That felt good to do...
to do what I wanted to do.
-- well I'm a real...
I'm saying I'm sorry.
-- no no it's fine.
You really use strong language.
To not do that.
To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What I just said...

And I bet you say that to all the girls --
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
So you've done it --
Did you ever go out with someone and just....
Yeah You know it?
No I'm off tonight.
I mean are you working?
I'd like to go...

Did you forget something?
It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
We were just getting started.
What's that stand for?
That'd be fine.
That's great thank you.

About two years ago.
You just move in here?
You mind if I check things back here?

I mean it's not.
No one else in there with you?
OPEN THE DOOR.
You mind if I come in check things?
No what's wrong?

So what'd they find out in there?
No school today.
My teacher got sick.
Sorry little man.
How much you pay me for my help?
I had that same question....
And the book says: ""We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us.
I love you and I'm sick.
for you so we can speak.
Love me back and I'll be good to you.
That's the first time you're right.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
How and Why, Kids?
Shall we drink to that?
But you're alright now so what's the what?
Might of been before my time.

When I find you when I meet you what?
If you fire me --
I'm sorry I was late.
This is making sense this making a lot of sense.
You are not doing the job the job I ask you to do a job I give you.
Over and over and over and I'm sorry.
I'm getting better.
That next moment: What?
Say it again...
walking in the car?
for her and to help her....
he took care of her and she died.
that's then what you get?
and we meet...
I was not...
I would say ""How many men you been with?
like as many women as she had men...
and I did and we were together....
age twelve but then again...
I hit her for what she did...
over and over and over again...
jesus christ what would I think...
did I think....?
for what I've done...
She's my wife for thirty eight years...
I went behind her...
over and over...
these two that I had and I lost....
She's my love...
love of it...
but we met.
And my friend knew her...
I would say ""What's that girl?
"" ""Oh she's a bad girl...
""  My friend would say this....
I went to another school you see?
when high school at the end what's that?
When you get to the end?
do you know her?
That's your son?
find him on the...
wants one thing:
-- it's not him.
it's not him.
where is he do you know?
that's another thing that goes --
When was the last time you talked to your son?
she's a good one...
She's a good girl.
She went out.
She'll be back.
And do good things with her...
find someone and hold on all that...
How's today then?
You have the wrong number.
I think you have the wrong number.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
And that's what you've heard?
I was told that your mother died.
That your mother died when you were young --
From when you were a boy.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
We talked earlier about your mother.
And we talked about your father and his death.
It's all important --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
Are you asking me that?
I would just want to clear some things up:
Let's talk about --
Things of the past!
Gone, Over, Done.
The System's state.
Like I said yeah --
-- go go go.
All it takes is one second?
You got us a room so quick?
Are you asking me a question?
no, no, no.
My mother's name actually.
You've done you're research.
It's not your given name right?
Where does that name come from?
Not even close to what I am today.
In five years?
And your father?
Are you close?
Does you mother still work?
And what did your parents do?
you want something...
can you say...
Can you stand...
maybe I mean...
When they put me on hold to talk to you...
He's in here --?
have you ever seen this..
I mean never mind you said --
About three weeks ago.
I think yes?
For six months.
How long have you taken care of him?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here okay?
He's in here.
Yeah let's...
maybe just stand.
She's not here she went out.
That you were trying to get me -- right?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE.
If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
I want you to stay --
WHAT'S THIS?
--- What was that?
It's a free country you can think anything you want.
I went out last night.
And what'd you have a party last night the way this place looks?
What's this how did this happen?
No I Said.
No one else in here?
You're just come in --
The door was open I got a call --
I got in trouble at school.
I want to tell her everything I've done.
Will you say my name?
I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Did your wife find out?
She's somewhere in the building --
You want her right now?
I KNOW THINGS.
Just like you!
Yes you do....
that I might have done something.
She said that to me last time...
when it was...
"" ""I know that.
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that you know.
I'm not through asking my questions.
I am but I'm not.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Do you have any children with anyone?
for all the the right reasons I hope what I said.
I talked to her this morning.
No one else that I know?
Was there anyone that I know?
I'll answer anything.
not much more...
How many times....
Do you want talk...
I've done...
No I mean:  I'm telling you this now.
for all the stupid things I've done....
that will eat me up....
We just do it...
How do we do this then?
Love you too..
Did you tell her?
-- did she talk to you?
Come home soon after the show.
No I'm just a friend.
What are you doing here I mean...
But I probably will get a call back.
Was it a call back?
Not as much as I used to.
You should get one I'm serious you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Where will the money go?
Other Things I've Done..
no you see...
I'm telling you this now...
this I've never told anyone...
And What Now Then?
-- I have something to tell you.
I want to change his will can I change his will?...
I need to ---
You're my friend.
If I talk to you...
if I tell you things...
there's so much...
so many things --
it's alright....
THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
NO ONE ELSE.
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.
HE IS DEAD.
HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Hang up the phone.
he asked me to get him and I did --
You could have quite a party all that stuff....
Thirty minutes or less.
yeah I said.
One of those.
I'd like to get an order of...
Shut up -- shut up --
I said I'm fine.
What's the problem what's the problem here?
You're late not me.
Should be one-thirty.
Be ready at two --
I need them.
I need my books.
I need them to go to school.
I need this one.
We need more dog food --
this is something that happens.
I can take you to get money.
I have to do this on my own.
I have money to give you.
Why does he do it...?
you have it...
The night we had together...
I always wanted more.
But that one it was enough.
I want you to remember that...
and go on.
As strong as you are now.
You had enough to carry.
There were two.
But not to love you...
No stay back!
Wear it until you love it.
He is nothing now.
He is your brother!
What had you to do with this Mother?
Take her from me!
He is dead now!
Not as the baby they took away but as a man.
Why would you ask now?
You never asked before!
He is dead!
By God's choice!
What is it mother?
May I speak with you?
Why do you call me --
So what has changed?
knows about this place.
If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
There is still much to do.
We must stop him!
About to hang himself I should think.
But -- what is he doing?
Remember the poor.
Yes and he has a choice!
And people close to him who --
I have it all worked out.
That is your plan?
He who is not with us is against us.
You would not be even if I had one.
I see that is a body!
But where did you get it?
Come we have a boat waiting.
I am with you!
I know the way.
Into the boat!
Pull them back!
God go with you.
Not even with God.
I will need you all.
All for one.
One for all.
We are old men now.
But once we were young.
Can we eat...
before we go?
We have to be lucky.
What use am I?
Now get some rest.
What does this have to do with...?
I remember that night.
I will answer all your questions.
He looks exactly like...
Easy to say but hard to do.
So they tell us.
Mother of God!
is this the way to hell?
The problem will come when we want out!
What choice is there?
Never have I needed more to say:  One for all and all for one.
Best not to ask.
Today is the day.
It is already done.
At the front?!
Her family is poor they have even less money than we do.
We were at her door.
But -- are you sure?
You look awful!
She died giving you to me.
Mother's ring.
Perhaps this will help.
Do I look all right?
Check for yourself.
No man is all bad...
or all good.
And perhaps I can help him.
Oh my friend.
What hope is there?
I came to try to bring you hope.
You knew this was happening.
You knew and that's why you came.
From a poor family.
I heard your playing.
Thanks but not for me.
Life is too long.
You're still a boy!
All this time...
How did you --
She will be at the ball.
Your mother's.
How did you know --?
Do not be sorry!
Never be sorry!
What you do is right for every person!
I am so sorry!
I will sit with you.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Is it something I have done?
Now I am free.
Look at this all this that for ten years I could not see!
there is something I hope you understand.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.
The old man and woman called me...
And you never knew why?
A man in black.
I never saw his face.
Why do you do this to me?
I once lived in a country house.
But no friends.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.
I ask now.
This man before you...
I -- I thought he was but...
He is my brother.
You knew you had a double?
Another stupid idea of my father's!
Go away I --
I will consider it.
Now leave me.
I order you!
That is enough!
Love women and they will love you.
Love yourself and --
There is more to love than he knew or that you know.
It is yours.
But do they love you?
Do you love them?
A son of your own?
She had written him many letters of love.
A personal nature?
Then there is one more thing of an even more personal nature.
I will deal with it tomorrow.
And my wish is to enjoy this party!
I decided it this morning.
Even if I could give up my friends I could never give up my son.
You have done your best.
What was the end page?
Two-thirty-seven:  ""...
Two-thirty-seven.
What number on the first page?
You dead yet?
Twenty run from four?!
Not by you.
Yes yes go on.
Exactly why it should be given away.
Both of us.
Listen my darling...
a good friend.
I did everything I could for him.
Did you know...
Shall I leave?
Where was it?
You are beautiful.
My dear I've already done it.
This is more than you are used to.
is in love...
How did I get in?
I -- How did you --
Yeah stick around you might learn something.
Alright we know who we're looking for.
well what are you getting at?
until last year.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Alright stay on the phone.
You set to go -
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
you look like shit.
Hey what they did on their time was their business you know?
Yeah I saw 'em around.
Did you start out area six?
Nineteen eighty four.
What fucking difference does it make?
I'll take the south end -
Find out for me.
Maybe she was looking for love...
Did you hit him?
Call for back-up this time!
Well that changes a lot...
He was out - and gone.
What were you thinking Jesus!!!
to get the car back you break into her house.
Where did you get the car!
And who are you?
Alright where is she?
And what did he do to the girl?
We were just fucking with him..
Well read this -
Did you read today's paper?
Wait a minute -
Where is he?!!
Where the hell is my car?
I took it with me.
What happened with the tape?
That's where I met him - told him what I had.
and met you.
What did you do then?
I had it all on tape...
No but I'm listening.
What exactly did you see?
Look what are you anyway?
I had to get away!
You have an answer for that?
Why did you set me up?
You'll find out - soon enough.
Figure you would have tried it already.
Mind if I turn out the light?
You got any family?
Where up north?
So where are you from?
I got my whole life in this place!
That was her - the girl...
Shit we just started.
It's not very much to go on...
is there anything else we can check?
Both at the same bank...
You're over your head this time.
I gave all that up.
I got a lot of free time you know what I mean?
Let's see what we got...
where do you want to start?
I've got a better idea...
You want to check it out?
But I'm in trouble.
I already think they're on to me!
Before it's too late -
Yeah I'm sure!
I did it with my own hands!
it's a long story.
Can we meet somewhere?
I need your help!
Run in with the law?
I'm in some trouble...
Not with this...
JIM  I read a book.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place you know what I mean?
No - that's not it!
What's the bottom line?
That's when it happened?
And he'd pick up on that.
It was you who did the asking.
Same goes for now.
Answer me that...!
Read about the next family in the morning paper?
Listen to me my friend: leave this.
We know he thinks the act is making him into something different.
What have we missed?
In thirty-five minutes.
But what book?
This is your boy...
When do they go to press?
Here and here.
Let's go to bed.
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
Nobody's better with evidence.
But he has the other thing too.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Wait for the back-up!
I'll cover the back.
How far away's the back-up?
This is our boy...!
Third's a woman.
It's getting late and...
He had to.
There is none!
He's very careful very...
How do I know?!
It's a word.
When I'm done.
When are you coming back?
I have to call him in a few minutes.
That mean anything to you?
I'll pick you up in...
I'll tell you in a second.
Now listen to me: everything is okay I'm taking care of it so stay on the phone when I tell you.
You need to know what it says right now.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
It's your call Will.
And if we pull it we lose a week...
Twenty-five minutes.
I want everybody moving in five minutes.
Who did he ask for?
You do know something about him.
If we find out how he found them then we'll find him.
What's one way?
We'll get him one way or the other.
He's got no face for me.
You walk in and see him.
He is good.
You said the guy down here is good.
I'LL come back later.
Let's talk after dinner.
Stay and eat.
These are all dead Will.
As long as they're dead...
I am all right.
You look all right now.
I came down here to get away from all that.
It's the way you think.
That was three years ago.
Eighty-six so far.
None of them knew that;
They're on if now...
twenty-eight minutes.
He went to the men's room.
Get right back here.
He just called.
He asked for Will.
He said he might call back tonight.
I tried to hold him...
And he was wrong.
Two groups of people were changed.
You can say.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Are you here...
You'll come by?
Are you okay...?
Should I come over?
Stay right here.
You look very good in the sun...
It's too nice outside.
If you show me where things are I'll make us some coffee...
Yes are you okay...?!
Is that you.
That was nice of you to think of that.
You worked out well.
Thanks but I'll take the bus.
I'll take you.
It'll do fine.
Think it'll do?
In eight days.
When do you need it?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Put your back against the door.
I want her!
YOU HEAR ME!!!
YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN.
YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
You'll let me go now?
You did very well.
He made me write them.
About his work.
Are you a man?
'  Do you see?
Open your eyes Mr.
In a little while I'll help you understand.
Do you know who I am Mr.
Listen I want to call my office.
You just rest there.
You'll be just fine.
Three four hours.
I'll read the bottom part.
Can you read it to me?
Where did you get it?!
Can you tell me anything about him?
I will have a chair put just outside.
The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr.
She'll be in in the morning...
Most people are.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.
Are you the man I'm interested in?
You tell me what you know about him.
I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Why do you think I called?
Do you know something about that?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What would you call him?
Nine that we know of.
Six bad ones in Mrs.
Eight in Mrs.
that's all I have.
That's all we know about.
Everybody else was dead.
You got a deal...
Maybe we should give it some time...
They're full of shit and they make me sick...
If they thought about it they'd want you.
And they'll take you.
You could come up here.
Small difference: I'm not dead yet.
I got myself together.
Come home with me.
By Friday I ought to...
I want to see you too.
I was out in the garden.
I have to be in there...
where are things?
I said this is too good to live...
Do you remember what you said?
You remember when we first met?
Be asked me if I knew.
I wanted to talk to him.
He said he wanted to bring it up to you.
Face to face.
I'm sorry this happened to you.
Go to bed now baby...
Blue is cold.
I have to see somebody.
There's not enough information.
Tell me what you're doing.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.
That or the day-to-day.
I love you too Will.
He'll never see me or know my name.
If we find him the police will have to take him down.
Not me I'm just looking at evidence.
Stay here with me.
If I were?
What you've already decided.
You're not really asking.
What the hell can I do?
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
You are open and easy now...
It took you a lot of work to get to that...
And you said?
He asked how you are.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
Tell her I called.
Must be the good air.
On the news they said he was a white man.
Go on to the house...
Go on to the house.
stop by and...
We're all well.
We're okay!
Coffee or something?
What kind of coffee do you like?
after a while.
She got all right?
It took a long time.
I saw it and it was...
It's just my job to find him.
And I'll do it.
No one can find our where you are.
I'll hang around in here.
Yeah but not now...
These will all make it...
Forty to fifty.
Will it keep them out?
Why does it feel good?
You should Will.
It must feel good to God.
God does it all the time!
I want to help you Will.
You can call me.
Would you like to give me your home number?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
You came here to look at me Will.
You thought of it before.
Let me have them and I might consider it.
And there's another reason.
Why should I tell you?
I thought you would have some ideas.
You read about it I'm sure.
What does it matter now?
Do you know how you did it Will?
Do you know how you did it'
Do you ever have any problems Will?
Did you get my card?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
I hope you have a second chance...
They're hot loads.
How well do you hear?
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
My hair is coming out.
You've got good days and bad days.
I know Tony better than you do.
Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off he'll do it!
The best show anybody's ever seen!
So how can I help you...?
Well then it has to stop!
No it's true.
They've just...
lost a reason to love you.
So I was just giving 'em what they want...
it's me.
Our first phone call!
But I'll do it again and again and AGAIN...
If I take it I'll break my back.
Here take this.
There's been some trouble with Tony.
How's the weather up there?
Good to hear from you!
And you -- you're the road manager!
I'm sorry George...
I'll go back.
see if somebody wants to buy it --
Those are my terms.
Fine I'll do it.
But I have a few terms.
I've been in this business for twenty years!
If you walk away from this opportunity you will never NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
No to the whole thing.
None of it sounds good.
""No"" to which part??
And this is a CLASS ACT!
But I got something better.
This is BIG...
You're not a stand-up...
where do you see yourself?
Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.
""Take my wife please""??
I needed you to believe!
You know that's not what I meant!
But it's funny!
But I like you!
I love this time of day.
We just met an hour ago.
Have you told your family?
there is no real you.
I'm a horrible person.
Oh it's open.
I-I'm sorry.
YOU get in the kitchen.
Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
And all this will be for real?
right there on the show!
What do you say???
Why did you call me?
I really want one.
No I'm sure we'll be fine.
am I late?
It was just part of the show!
Get off the stage!
The kids will love it --
You're not listening to me --
It's what we're known for!
NO NO NO!
None of that!
I want this show to be positive!
I want the evening to build and build.
Yeah exactly -- ""was""!
Who gives a shit?!
It's not funny!
Sir do you have a problem?
What is this World War Two...?
She'll say ""Now my son is a man.
What will my mother think?
They're asking for it.
Give me the book.
You make them love you...
What do they know?
Each show is worse than the next.
So HELP ME!
It is apparently not working.
But we feel that perhaps...
This is very difficult for me to say...
Tony called me himself.
Yeah I KNOW what I said!
You're not getting BOTH of them!
I GOT A CONTRACT!!
Get off my stage!
We had a deal!!
I want nothing to do with this.
Hey that's good!
We can make that play.
You get better you get worse...
God listen to this!
But what's the POINT?
Now I get to be Tony.
See if you can get him away from all this.
Find something special.
That was a really hot house!
Why is he saying these things?!
He said he's coming back!
I saw Michael!
Of course he's in his room.
All his ""friends"" are in there.
They are dead.
In either case --
Did you get anything from the room?
You all look the same to me.
We meet at last.
Something wrong man?
My own personal Jesus Christ!
You're two hours late.
But it's not here.
You are a beautiful woman.
Too bad things had to work out like this.
Someone has to.
for the drink.
Since I've been here.
How many were there?
You're here to save the world.
What do you say to something like that?
Why you're here?
You get used to it though.
He's beginning to believe.
Give me your phone.
There is a phone.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.
she told me --
That is why it is so important for you to go.
I know why you're afraid to go through that door.
That I would find the One not that he would find me.
Did you believe in them too?
The five before me?
And you still believe I'm the One?
I do not believe things with my mind.
I believe them with my heart.
So I can hear some old lady tell me what?
That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for?
The one that's supposed to save the world?
I mean who am I?
I'm nobody I'm just a guy.
What do I believe it?
That I would find the One.
And she's never wrong.
For her there is no past present or future.
There is only what is.
How does she know?
She would say she knows enough.
And she knows what?
She's very old.
She's been with us since the beginning.
Set down in there.
Your mind makes it real.
I know what you're trying to do --
It's not possible!
I say almost funny.
We have only bits and pieces of information.
What is real?
More important than what is when?
You've never used them before.
am I dead?
You can see it out your window or on your television.
Do you want to know what it is?
Let me tell you why you are here.
You've felt it your whole life felt that something is wrong with the world.
But I think we both know there's more to it than that.
I can see it in your eyes.
Do you still want to meet?
You see you may have spent the last few years looking for me but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
If they knew what I know you would probably be dead.
There are only two ways out of this building.
You take a chance either way.
It's too far away.
Now there is a window.
But what if...?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Who's coming for me?
He is the One.
He is the One!
We're on our way --
Got one ready sir.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.
In the other hand you will have your own.
Which one will be up to you.
What do you mean without him?
Without him we are lost.
We will never find the One.
Your next life maybe.
That's how these things go.
I'm not the One.
' Then you say --
You think you're the One?
Shit I'm sorry.
Come on we have to keep moving.
You moved like they moved.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Let me tell you what I believe.
I believe I can bring him back.
I'm sorry I'm not.
I'm just another guy.
have to be.
That I would have to make a choice...
There has to be something that we can do.
It just went dead.
It happens when they change something.
It might have been.
How much like it?
Was it the same cat?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Did you go to her?
Should I be?
I used to eat there...
Get this thing out of me!
And I know that's not where you want to be.
You already know that road.
What the hell is this?!
When I asked him he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.
They have to see it to believe it.
It's the question that brought you here.
You know the question just as I did.
I know why you left your family and your friends why you left your home to come to this city.
You're looking for him.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
you were a guy.
How do you know that name?
I know that's what it looks like but it's not.
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.
Three of them!
She told me this would happen.
It would be the end of everything.
Depends on the mind.
All it takes is time.
What are they doing to him?
Ready for more?
You live long enough you might even see it.
The only place we got left.
It's a city?
Right here in the real world.
You will tonight.
I lost him.
You have to send me back!
What the hell just happened?
They're moving him.
Let go of her.
Whether she wants to or not...
Nothing's private...
this is private...
and maybe we can work something out...
Well we're here for about two weeks then whatever else comes along...
thought it was great.
Know where he is?
Now you got it or not?
That means it's good.
You want good stuff or you want shit?
you know what that means?
Well we want good stuff.
Yeah yeah never mind.
Well the guy over there said...
hey where you kids from?
can we give you a check?
Hey hold it!
That's good business.
I'll be back in thirty minutes.
no more good times like before.
Until you come back.
Listen try a place with some sun.
I'll write.
I could talk...
Yeah well thanks but I got enough to hold me.
My mother can send me some.
Hey come on...
If I get there.
I know I know stupid.
it's out of your hands.
Throw it away.
away from here for the night...
Get out of here before this really goes up.
She's always in here with some different guy.
You know the way they are.
May God be with you.
Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
A question please...
We believe you...
We believe you.
I've only had him a couple of days.
Next time bet with your own kind.
but keep trying.
it's all he has on him.
I've got something for you...
Back so soon.
No I just want to help myself that's all.
think about it will you?
Oh cut it out will ya?
No you're not...
I'm doing it for you stupid!
After what I'm doing for you?
I'm stupid remember.
I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me remember?
That's what I get for getting involved.
I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Yeah take it easy.
That'll help you out fine.
That's the best way for you not for me!
if anybody can do it he can.
I'll still try to help you out...
Did you see them run!
Cut it out stupid.
She's always got something.
you got nothing here.
take it easy.
I'll show.
Tuesday I'll give Michael something.
Where's your job...
You talk and talk and I go to work...
what do you do?
You're not supposed to like it.
tomorrow you show up.
You sick or what?
Hold onto your pay- check this week.
Yeah big man...
get yourself in more trouble.
You think I could stay at your place tonight?
Your mother's not there is she?
All right forget it.
Tony you got anything we can put on his face?
I know but let's hear it anyway.
but about next week...
Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
I should know?
Probably off with one of his little girls...
Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.
And tell me why should I care?
I'm getting old.
Not next week's either...
There is nothing to give him.
the ones from last year...
Would you believe that?
do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...
you're here.
They told me you're here...
and you're here.
Yeah where's the rest?
Look Michael I'll get him here.
We'll be here.
and I mean it.
Look take this for now.
start asking you questions.
I've talked to him and I've talked to him...
what more can I do...?
I call him at work...
Oh Michael look...
You getting out too?
Get him in.
Michael believe me.
I made a deal with him not you right?
I think you should be you know that.
Yeah he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.
That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
Why not here...
Yeah you know...
it'll be different though...
In a little while...
No I'm serious...
You're really good.
when you're on...
Well maybe you missed something?
so I take an interest.
What do they expect you to say?
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...
she wants to leave...
That's what I said sick in the head.
The one who's sick right?
His whole family has problems...
but it's the same thing all the same...
they're in there by having something on somebody...
They know where to come when they need us.
I realize this during the war...
Oh yes he's pretty good.
to read so I read it.
like your friend...
And when he was there...
Hey where you been?
Take a drink!
his business is bad.
But I'll decide what to do and you...
and you just keep out of anything that might...
I think he put on this act...
I could help if you want.
I was there and...
Did you have a good time last night?
I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
was a short story.
I told you before...
will you please listen to me?
I want to talk...
well have you got any idea where he is?
The building on the corner.
You've been running round too much.
Of all people.
You know why...
with my parents.
probably a good idea.
Watch your language.
That's the word...
I'm almost finished.
A paper on that one too?
we can come back in a couple of weeks.
one more day.
I'll call in sick for work.
to get some food.
It's still sick.
You missed the point.
He thinks he's in good standing.
not unless it was personal.
CHRIST you should have seen it.
Not half as much as we were though.
Hey did you hear any more about what happened last night?
at your place.
Nobody knows anything believe me.
Maybe who knows.
Well if things go the way I hope they'll go this money business will take care of itself.
Do you have enough?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
it's all there.
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Yeah so things'll be even.
Yeah it's your father's.
it's just that I...
This is some boat.
Your father's?
Friends of yours Michael.
A double for Michael Tony.
have a heart.
Yeah speak for yourself.
-- But he does seem very nice.
That's your name?
What's on the table for discussion?
That's more than we get to do.
Love that name.
Come on a name.
But that's what you were thinking.
And that's okay.
It's for the party Dad --
That's okay Daddy.
Whatever it was they'll be here.
Now I'm getting interested.
I want to know more ---
Does your friend have a name?
And you could care less --
I know you do darling.
But it's your birthday.
This is your thing.
Not much more.
Big day in the big city.
Have you got a minute?
Someone I could talk to.
Or would talk to me.
Remember everybody tonight dinner in the city at Daddy's.
What do you do that for?
This shit's not bad.
I thought you were buying my company.
Left field somewhere.
Bill thanks for coming over...
How would you like that sir?
You mean this sir?
Yes sir Mr.
I mean you and him.
No not okay.
Daddy'll do fine.
And so do you.
He'll wait --
We're not getting anywhere here.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.
And what would that be?
Not good not bad you know what we got?
Who are we talking about?
But can I tell you something else it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.
That means without you.
Then why did you bring it up?
It's just a saying Mr.
Why yes thank you.
How about some water?
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
And what do I get?
But who is he?
Black to you all.
Are you running this Board or am I?
Yes you are to understand that and now may I ask you a question?
And I'm not interested in the big picture either.
The answer is no quick enough for you?
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something Bill?
What is there to say?
Okay we'll see you tomorrow.
Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Mind if I throw up?
I want you to know I value your advice.
How nice for you both.
But the matter's still on the table Bill --
Is there any more to it?
Yeah something he goes by --
As close as a deal could be.
You have a way with words.
Bill after this deal you'll be able to afford one.
Okay so far?
No no not you.
Did you just hear something?
Maybe who knows?
Well it's a big day.
Thanks for coming out.
He had no choice.
He was interested.
Well I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.
I'd like to come too.
Well that's very interesting.
Yeah that's what he said.
Those were his words?
More people might --
Can do no right by people.
She knows how she feel.
My Doctor Lady?
Oh you come to see Doctor Lady?
No I come to see Doctor.
You come for me?
Make it time.
Not time yet.
I on holiday.
What you then?
The Board is waiting.
-- And call my family I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Oh God what do I do?
Free to love each other.
How did you meet?
Oh yes I do.
You look like you need one bad as me.
A little hard to figure maybe...
It's so very nice to see you again.
As long as it takes.
I love you now I'll love you always --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
But you're not.
You're somewhere else.
You're someone else --
You want me to wait for you you'll be back --
-- That was the place...
and you were the guy.
Yes that's why I said it.
It's a saying.
What will we do?
That will come later.
But there's so much to tell you --
We know all that we need to know --
We know so little about each other --
No worse than it gets for me.
I can tell you the when part.
Your father and I our time together has come to an end.
Oh I hope a long long time.
Did you like making love to me?
You're here?
It was everything.
I'm sorry about --
I said get out.
We're doing what we can for her.
I've found that it does.
Well now I am sorry.
Be sorry for nothing.
I have to go I'm sorry to say --
I'm a doctor I'm --
Whatever you do.
Watch me do what?
Very well I'll watch.
How nice you look.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
I've got plenty of friends.
Happy Birthday Bill.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
I told you to shut up.
Get him in here.
Did you tell her who you are?
She says she's in love with me.
Well they're mine now.
Those were my words Bill.
So that's what love is?
It's not love --
I love her Bill.
I'm sorry Bill --
And what the hell does that mean anyway?
I think you heard me Bill.
I was just asking Bill.
What the hell do you care?
Tomorrow after the party.
What are you saying that it's time to go?
So watch it...
But I know who you are.
You've lived a first-rate life.
I'm her father!
Well you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Yes I saw you see me.
How about you telling me?
When I ask a simple question I expect a straight answer.
That's what I'm used to.
You tell me Bill.
What way would you put it?
Why did you go to the hospital?
A man wants to leave something behind.
And he wants it left behind the way he made it.
This part I'm interested in.
She knew stuff like that.
No thank you Bill.
I know I'll be seeing you.
-- What's the deal here?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
So can I.
I want to live.
I'm not everybody.
I'm still young this is not my time --
How about giving a guy a break?
You've got a deal.
You give your word I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.
It is a deal?
Sounds fair enough.
This is the left- field thing of all time.
What do I tell my family?
Good morning Bill.
Good night to you Bill.
I hope you realize Bill...
in your office this morning that was your time.
I just saw my doctor he told me everything was fine.
That's the best I can do.
When you go I go.
How long have I got?
Would you like the man's name?
What a good idea.
The body I took knew her.
The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.
I mean that you knew her and everything --
Speak up please.
Could I say something?
And your family.
And that's what we're doing.
It's not open for discussion.
You should hope quite a while.
You fill the bill Bill.
You're not Death.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
I think you know --
Talk to me --
It's enough now.
What you were talking about.
I believe you did.
I know it's none of my business.
Yes I believe I do.
Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?
Yeah I give a shit.
But he does give a shit.
It's out of this world.
Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man I'm in his corner.
No anything is possible.
Or the week after.
I want to talk to you about them next week.
And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
I am this is it.
I'm doing great.
How're you doing--?
But we want you back Bill.
Black may we say thank you.
I just wanted to set the record straight.
Either way thanks.
We're all here Bill --
Talk to you Monday.
Big doing up here.
Why are you still down here?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?
You'll be up in the country?
Black shall we?
Give it some air?
Oh Dad you're not old.
You'll never be old.
That's why it's okay.
I love you Daddy --
I want you to know how much I love you.
What a night.
I'm telling you he's no good for you!
The guy's working with you.
What are you afraid of Dad?
Then what will you say?
The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Yeah it's good to get together.
That was wonderful.
It'll come back Daddy.
You and I've got to talk.
Big day tomorrow everybody.
He was looking for a doctor.
I'm ready for action.
What is it Daddy --?
Daddy what's the matter?
But thanks anyway.
But I'm the only father you've got.
But give it to me again.
And how do you find him?
Forget your head and listen to your heart.
You have to try.
Oh yes I am.
You're not listening --
That's for me.
So what's wrong with that?
I know it's none of my business --
There's a start for a meeting.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Now could we go?
Let's get this day started.
You're only six-five once.
Not my birthday again?
I know it is a big deal day --
Good morning Dad.
But we've got time.
We know so little about each other.
Now I've got to go.
Sure I'll give you the name of a doctor.
If I came by could you give me the name of a doctor?
I've got to go --
Please what do you say another cup of coffee?
-- This is my lucky day.
Yes I could.
I have an office in the hospital.
I could be her.
So if I needed a doctor you could be it?
Everybody's a doctor around here.
What kind of doctor?
Looking for her right now.
You might be her.
So you're a one-girl guy?
What's the way?
I never need them all anyway.
Not to me!
I probably know more about it than you do!
I think I know her.
Whatever gets you off.
Like you just took it off or something.
Should I wear it?
Yeah but there's a call for you from this guy.
You're still paying for it.
It's still Your room.
When was I in here?
This was your room.
No let's go.
Seen you together that's all.
What makes you think he's my friend?
If we talk for too long I'll forget how we started.
I think I may have.
I'm not good on the phone.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Interested in buying one?
I like your car.
Take the money and walk away!
Just take it!
Yeah I remember you.
So why did you come here?
You have no idea where you've just come from?
What you've just done?
How do you know about me?
Well that's me.
What are you here for?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
They're not looking for him.
That's easy for you to say!
For your wife right?
What do you think I am?!
And his money.
He thinks I have it.
He thinks I took it.
Somebody's come.
I had to tell him something!
I told him about your car.
Why would he be interested in me?
I'll go see him.
* lot of people.
What do the police think?
Who did he go to meet?
I know the feel of the world.
I can remember so much.
I know the feel of the world  and I know her.
There are things you know for sure.
You decided to help me.
You can question everything you can never know anything for sure.
I think someone's fucking with me.
So I just take your word?
I came to you straight after he did it.
How do I know he did that to you?
How did you get me into this?!
You're not into anything.
What have you got me into?
You know what we have in common?
Might be useful.
I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Tell me about her again.
I think he's been in the bar before
So you have information for me?
She seemed to leave happy.
I'm not interested in the company position Mr.
Just let me read please.
You've read it a hundred times.
How can you read that again?
When it's done I'll know!
It'll be different!
I was wrong!
That's the whole point!
Like you've told yourself.
Everyone who'll listen.
Gets better every time you tell it.
Nothing wrong with that - we all do.
Everything'll be okay.
He thinks it's funny.
How'd you know I was in here?
Yeah well thanks for the advice.
My wife's death.
Like how'd you get this car?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
What sort of questions?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Do not go back to her.
She has no idea who I am.
Yeah well maybe she'll make it you.
They'll want to make somebody pay.
Maybe she'll try and make it you.
What do you mean ""bad news""?
Your business here is very much finished.
Let's trade.
Fucking hope not.
It must be his.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
He's got to have a car right?
We've got to get him out of here.
No just let me think for a minute.
You wanted my help.
Probably left it in your room.
It's all I have.
You're living.
You really want to find this guy?
I heard enough about him.
You still think he's here right?
Only every time I see ya!
Come on I'll buy you lunch.
Look stay there okay?
What the hell you want to go there for?
This is your car.
Where ya' from?
You need to know that...
Then that's it.

I got to know.
There is never any room for ""personal""...
I know you were close to them.
We know these people...!
We see the lights...
Just came in.
Get me Air Support...
We'll know only at the last moment...
He is fine.
Everybody gets it.
So right here right now they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.
So let me know if we're on...
You need to consider a few issues.
They've cut into us.
Tell them what you want.
It's like that.
We're not certain!
We're not certain...
I got the item.
You got the ""item""?
All I want to know is the where and the when.
Just like I said.
And we never will.
in the morning.
I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.
But none of this will happen.
And all you see around you...
He is my man.
Then I'd find you.
This is the talk of a man...
if he were your husband...
Would you find me...?
Everybody needs it.
Do I need it?
"" ""Your friends love you.
Maybe I'm only one.
I would say you're...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
I need thirty.
to even consider it.
Anywhere for any reason it comes up short we make good.
""  And the answer is ""of course"" but also ""no.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
""  That's nice.
are of today and not tomorrow.
She is the most beautiful woman in the room.
Then I read.
it's all business...
I am no one's wife.
I live in my own house.
I do not live in a man's house.
He has a wife.
We are together.
I am free.
And I can do anything I want...
How's he not your husband?
Where's she now?
those days in those days...
we still have the house.
We will go there...
And he is not my husband...
No one will go near your boat...
What do you like to drink?
What's ""nothing""?
How much are you looking for?
We want it back.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
So what is this a party?
How do I know Mrs.
It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Even with one of your friends.
She's here now...
Here's what this is...
And what do I do with him?
He tried to...
But there were...
That part of what I do you never want to find out about.
But we are into business and making money.
Who you run loads for?
What's your take?
I am asking.
You to me.
""  And there is ""Which way is up?
And he wants us to give that up?
Oh that makes it okay then.
On my way back...
Where the hell are you man?
How much we looking for?
So let's go...
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?
Where we meeting 'em...?
You pick it up.
And you drive it...
What kind of weight?
So we can close each other's eyes right now.
But then nobody makes any money...
Into this group.
What does that say to you?
What's our deal?
If you're down we're down for the play.
Then you should.
Too many moving parts.
Twenty on my man...
Control your men.
Who's the ""we""?
There's you and there's us.
Low-level we think.
Make a buy?
That went well...
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
""Buy and walk""?
Guy's involved in a ""meet""...
But we know this guy.
I think you know this guy.
I do not know what case you have him on.
I do not know what he is talking about.
How will it stand up?
But it was from the get-go.
How'd they get onto you?
look after her.
Do that for me.
I had to do it.
Whatever you can do for them.
They're on their own...
Where are you...?
And that's the point.
I need to know everything he said.
Do not be.
I am careful.
You worry about you.
It's quality girl.
How long did it take them?

What would you do...?
And people who are good at what they do?
And he will need a story.

But I also see you...
Wait by the phone.

He was taken.

I saw what was after her.
What are you doing down here?
My God what the hell are you...?

This is our baby Peter.
But it look like a man.
We can do it!
We can do this...

They know we're in here!
No Jesus no.
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Why take the chance?
Just let me go down there with you...
You said that thing was big as your hand.
And here we are...
I was just late.
Oh no you were-
No such thing baby.
Fine then I'm the bad guy.
He was just doing his job.
Oh so I'm the bad guy now?
I heard how you talked to him.
Did you hear how he talked to us?
No there's...
Even if they did...
We'll tell you when to stop...
I needed to think.
Thought it was my week for that.
I'll be late.
Okay meet me out front.
see you tonight.
We get lucky maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Do you think we did the right thing?
You looked great tonight.
I told them you're real busy.
Not a big one.
She was having problems too.
Now that you know the way...
You got a point there...
Well I just thought--oh look at me.
maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
It's right this way.
So went to town.
And paper to type on.
Anything you can tell me might help.
Did I do good?
You'll know everything in a minute.
You'll know very soon.
You have to tell me.
Sorry it's just that this is so wonderful.
It's almost done.
But the time is now.
Soon others will come.
We are meant to be together.
We must finish the book.
It's been over a week.
Why would I run away?
You've been out of your room.
Paul I know you've been out.
Why would I want to leave?
The book is almost finished.
Soon you'll be able to walk.
Why would you lose me?
But now I know I love the rest of him too.
Oh God what have I done?
I'm so sorry Paul.
I just thought it might be nice.
Well it certainly says you.
I just picked things up over the years.
I'll go look.
Wait let's do this right.
Have to wait.
have to wait.
Well is it fair?
"" You said it.
What's the matter Paul?
I'm not stupid you know.
You can leave that in.
I'm sorry Paul.
This is all wrong you'll have to do it over again.
You'll be brilliant.
Here in case you think of any ideas.
Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I'll tell you what's the matter.
I go out of my way for you.
I do everything to try and make you happy.
And what thanks do I get?
No just the paper will be fine.
Thank you for thinking of me.
Anything else I can get while I'm in town?
I thought you'd be interested.
Not just the finished book but how it's written.
I'll be the first one to read it.
Oh but Paul!
You mean write?
What in the world do you think I'd write?
Set what up?
This is a very big day for you Paul.
And look what I've got for you.
Nobody ever has to see it.
I'll just keep it for myself.
I know this may be difficult for you but it's for the best.
Show me the way?
But this time I thought clearly.
I'll get you everything you want but you must listen first.
But first there's something you must do.
What are you doing on the floor?
If I'd had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened.
Here let me help you back in.
I want HER!
Of course I'll like it.
Well I hope you like it.
She made me so happy.
She made me forget all my problems.
I know how that can be.
She's a fine...
I'm getting to believe you.
I thought it was time you two should meet.
I can live with ""great.
But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Well mine's still out.
But the ones in town were working just fine.
The one to town is but that's about it.
I told him who you were and what had happened.
There I said it.
Oh like I could do that?
What's your new book called?
If you give me their numbers I'll keep trying them for you.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up?
You're very kind...
Lucky for you I did.
Lucky for me too.
Will I be able to walk?
What are they...?
You've been here two days.
It's good you found it.
Right where it's supposed to be.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.
Where the hell is that thing?
Just leave it all right?
What do you expect to find?
Hey Jim what's doing?
Jim we've been over this.
He might well be.
But not the way they say.
Hope not--if he is he's dead.
Stop--stop right here.
Four or five days ago.
We actually got a phone call.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
So when there was no word from him...
Yeah I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I'm sure you're right.
So do I...
Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Nothing odd about that.
Sold 'em all in three days.
Answer me a couple things?
Well maybe not completely--
I thought you were over it.
But it's not why I wrote the book.
Did they win?
I never meant it to become my life.
For the first time in fifteen years I think I'm really onto something here.
Not a bad business.
it's nice Paul.
It's got...
Like it was waiting for me.
Afraid he's got no choice.
From her point of view or mine?
Why do you think she's really here?
He'll look after you.
Something's come up.
Sort it all out.
I need time.
See anything you like?
She'd never won a bloody thing.
Maybe that's it then.
Oh I am.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
And my room?
How do you that.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..
how in the world did you ever find me?
Ball's in your court Mr.
No time at all once I've got it.
What've you got to say?
Come on out here you bad girl.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?
I knew where it was.
And you're happy about that?
Which means Mr.
We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Ninety-three point four million.
More like two-two point two million.
It's that time.
So first things first.
They're into something.
Oh well if that's how you feel about it.
Just when it was about to get interesting.
Anything you need to get move or watch I'm your man.
I hope there's a place to land.
Not for seven more minutes.
in the building...
Exactly where is she?
I think we got a problem.
I'm not ready!
Why would he do it?
Then we got'em!
Five and a half minutes.
You just looked as if you did.
Just do it now.
What did you think you were doing!
You've done well and we're so close.
Come on now off you go!
You told me to get out of here.
the thought of never seeing you..
how are we getting out of here?
Just get me out of here.
You need to think it over.
You'll meet him somewhere in a month.
How do you suggest I go about it?
What's happened.
I want <i>you out of there.
Where do I meet you?
Have you met them?
We know him.
How can you possibly?
Before you are.
Maybe he's lost interest.
Then feel better!..
Can you think of a better one?
And that's the only reason?
Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Are you telling me I have to do this?
Why did you have to tell me about this!
What do I have to do to get away from this guy?
And it looks like he's done it again.
But it's not mine to give.
But it is what you'd like me to do.
so tell me to do it..
Not that it matter much but..
That's lot of people out there..
Five six-hundred thousand.
Ask a question you get an answer!..
you ever afraid?
Well then what I am I doing here?
So where did I got right?
They've got a book for everything.
They've got a book for this?
What's you name?
Oh bloody hell.
I can make them go away.
Pull over and listen to me will you?
Where did you get this number?
Now be serious.
Wanted to see how good you were.
Hey you put me here.
I just do what I'm told.
Where's the bloody -
where is it?
Oh either way works for me.
Would you mind if I'm on top?
You're not just another pretty face..
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Just as if I'd like to.
Where is she now by the way?
But in this case -
That's the best way really.
About why she did it?
Yes I believe that's right.
</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.
Oh by the way you might want to take a look at these..
You mean it'll be difficult.
She's a woman.
She's got all the training she needs.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
The question is why?
What did you think of him?
He double you what?
Two three times?
So let's get on with it.
An idea yeah.
You're sorry and I'm sorry.
I'm fine..
not in time to save him.
Yes he knew.
He was quite a man.
Yes I'm sorry too..
They're ready and waiting.
You'll soon be with old friends.
So what did he say?
She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.
How much time does she have left?
Now how to get in there.
If he had them both he could sell them anywhere.
You know I think it's a little late for that.
Now that's not so difficult to understand is it?
there it is.
By asking me.
'  My my my...
You took it!
And what if I need it?
His name is.....
You're right of course.
You asked for my help.
What kind of show.
But why tell us?
No-one gets on.
No- one gets off.
Only four more cars.
What about him...?
It never happened.
Same thing he's always wanted!
Make him come to us.
So what do you suggest?
All ten million.
Course he did.
Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.
You knew about Jim?
May take a little time.
Is he serious?
Listen to me Jim.
We take the money.
No-one will believe him.
You are my eyes.
Stay with him.
Is this the only way?
I've never worked with him.
I lost the team.
Just walk away.
What kind of help?
They have to be local.
Jim was my husband.
You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead I'm with you.
No one sent me!
Who sent you?!
Who is they who is they?
Did they send you...
Did they send you?
Who is ""they?
That was four hours ago!
Did they send you here?
I walked away.
He was gone so I walked away.
Jim's dead.
What happened to Jim?
You were in the car.
I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.
He said someone was...
You were in the car!
Talking's good walking's better.
Walk just walk.
On your feet.
Suppose you tell me?
And -- like you said.
Maybe this'll save some time.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.
Why was there another team?
Who else is left?
I follow you.
They knew we were coming.
He was a good guy for a long long time.
Just - not long enough.
They want you back in.
I'll get you close.
It's hard to tell.
Exactly that's your job.
What's the range of this thing?
Now I want you to hold onto it.
What'd they used to call you?
What about Job?
as long as you tell me where the money is.
Ha dear boy!
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Bring it to me in London.
I want it by the end of the week.
I'll give you the same.
What was your deal with Job?
Deal's off.
Okay use it.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Why may I ask?
Ah but we're asking about you.
And how might you know that?
Are you another Company man?
It's quite out of the question.
You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Hold it - it's on.
That's not the list.
Where exactly is it?
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Then what am I doing here?
I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Ten million is better than six.
I knew about Jim.
And get a doctor.
I usually am.
no more Cold War.
I can sit up straight.
sit up straight very well.
It's not important!
it was easy.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Can you lose him?
Should be a second.
Not this week.
He's our guy.
So he says ""All right.
""  She says no.
Ah God forget it.
Tell you what?
I thought I'd take some now.
A hundred and sixty-seven I think it is.
Take it all if you want.
Yeah well Jim fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
I think I might just take that look.
No in your...
Can you hear me now?
Of course I can hear you.
Look to your right then back to me.
Run it through from the top.
Is something wrong with the phone?
Try it again.
Thirty-two and change.
That's not so good for you my friend.
Twenty-six twenty-seven.
I know I am so sorry for so many things.
It's been everything.
The men wanted to try to get home.
And I'll have the special fish.
How are you tonight?
Your life is not built on nothing.
that his life is built on nothing.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Have I been a good wife?
I just want you to know.
No matter what you do.
I have no money!
Big as a house!
This is the funny part.
I think it's great and about time.
And that's how much I'm saying.
I'll say no more.
I have my eyes open.
I got it done.
What'd you do to your hair?
Let's go tell your Mother.
It looks stupid.
It's a man's ring.
Where's the ring?
You've got to come.
You've got to give me away.
In a month.
When will you do it?
He's a big baby.
Who's the man?
The guy died.
What's your news?
It's too much like death.
Why you looking around so much?
You know everything.
The woman wanted to be cheap but the man saw that I was right.
And what did they say?
It costs money.
We open in five minutes.
We only got twelve done.
Things are very bad in my house.
I'm eighty-three years old.
It's wrong to just let them go.
We can get this out on the table.
Come upstairs with me baby!
Come upstairs with me and get in my bed!
Let me go home.
Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed.
The only thing that's here is you.
I want you to come upstairs.
It's the way we are.
And you're not now?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I'm really afraid.
I went with you.
Otherwise what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?
This is your place.
You're late!
And what do you know?
You tell me my life?
I'll tell you yours.
I know what I know.
It's really cold.
What do you want to do now?
I knew she was sick...
That was just so...
It's the best thing there is.
Where are we sitting?
For your hair.
you know I feel like a man again.
Yeah well he's dead.
Come on let's go in.
I thought I'd try it.
Where's the Met?
Meet me at the Met.
I love two things.
That you come with me tonight.
I will not come.
But he wants me to come!
Then I must never see you again.
I'm in love with you!
Last night never happened you hear me?
Oh yes oh yes you did!
It's in a few weeks.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
There will be nothing left.
Get all of me.
I was dead too.
Take me to the bed.
To the bed.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand.
He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I'm telling you your life!
That was the price you had to pay to be free.
That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman.
I met a man.
He wanted to have a baby right away.
Then he got hit by a bus.
I can see everything.
You really are stupid you know that.
She was right to leave me.
Why you talking to me?
I have not been lucky.
How many men since then?
Seven years ago.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man.
No woman since then?
Bus hit him.
He knew my husband who died.
I like it well done.
I do what I want.
No I want you to see this!
Maybe I should come back another time.
I have no life.
Do you want...
Have you come from my brother?
Let me come and talk to you.
What's wrong can never be made right.
Yeah I'll be in.
See you tomorrow?
I got things to do.
In time you will see that this is the best thing.
I must ask for that back.
I've got your ring here!
And she got well.
I need my family around me now.
You have a brother?
Call this number.
It's a business number.
I'll take care of the whole thing.
All you have to do is show up.
A month from today?
At the City Hall?
How about a month from today?
Then let's set the date.
How near is she to death?
I like this ring.
Yes on the floor.
On the floor?
Never is a long time.
She was too young for him.
Oh God that's too bad.
He wanted to talk to you.
He's coming back this morning.
No more he's not.
Everything's different.
Your hair's different.
A wife knows.
Just like your father.
He thinks you came home last night.
Where's that card?
Did he tell her?
How's the mother?
I love the house.
And we'll sell the house.
We'll live there.
What's thirty-seven?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
So we'll sell the house.
Will you live here?
But you like him?
We just come from the bank.
What's the matter with him?
You should think about this.
But I must find the right moment.
He has not asked my advice.
He should pay.
But he does not want to pay.
He says he is a big baby.
Okay I'll tell her.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning.
No that's really it.
That's the reason!
But why would a man need more than one woman?
and the women have that.
That was my father-in-law who has a wrong idea in his head.
Well that's news.
Maybe I should go?
I was waiting up for my husband.
She's not home yet.
I'll make you a drink.
But now she's not.
I'm sure she did.
Of course I want to.
You may not want to.
She had red hair.
Can I get another one of these?
I'm too old for me.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm a little cold.
You knew that man?
May I walk with you a ways?
There's old saying my mother told me.
Would you like to hear it?
Yes she was.
Will you join me for dinner?
I just got that.
She was just too young for you.
What exactly does your husband do?
It's a house.
You mean the whole house?
That's my house.
I knew she had it.
She's got it.
They'll hear you in the back.
What would he be doing down there?
Is who down there?
Is he down there?
Bring her forward.
She looks like one.
Yes she does.
They could be carried.
We found them.
Who goes there?
where does he live...
He'd be able to deal with this one.
that's no basis for a system of government.
Order eh -- who does he think he is?
Well who is your lord?
No one live there.
Please please good people.
All of us are...
You said it again!
We shall do no such thing...
let us pass!
May we go now?
And not too expensive.
One that looks nice.
You are fair and just.
No more please.
All right we'll call it a draw.
Have at you!
You'll what...
I'll do you for that.
Course I have.
Come on then.
Well what's that then?
So be it!
I move for no man.
None shall pass.
Well what are you then?
can we come up and have a look?
+ +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one.
Are you sure he's got one?
He's already got one you see?
Oh just some friends!
It's the...
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
|      It's not working.
You're not doing it properly.
More like this.
Now what happens?
Who did we lose?
It's always the same...
if I've said it once.
You got us all worked up.
Look you're a busy man...
You know my name?
By what name are you known?
Oh Did you hear that!
What a give-away.
Shut up will you.
I order you to shut up.
But all the decision of that officer...
Oh very nice.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman but from the behind you looked...
:I'm thirty-seven...
I'm not old.
I'm thirty-seven.
Course it's a good idea.
I feel happy...
I feel happy.
I think I'll go for a walk.
I'm getting better!
He will be soon.
Off you go.
That's easy!
Who's that then?
See you on Thursday.
When's your next round?
They've lost nine today.
Well can you hang around a couple of minutes.
He says he's not dead.
Here's one!
Bring out your dead!
It just seems silly...
Really I feel fine sir.
I think I'll be all right to come with you sir.
I think I could pull through sir.
I'm not quite dead sir...
Thank you sir most kind...
Do you want to come and have a drink?
the thing is...
I thought your son was a lady.
I can explain everything...
They cost fifty pounds each!
She's beautiful...
I'd rather...
just to show 'em.
So I built a another one...
I built another one...
So I built another...
Oh I see  Right.
We're coming with you.
Oh yes of course!
I thought you meant him!
No not anyone else - just me.
Until you or anyone else...
just keep him in here.
we'll keep him in here obviously.
But if he had to leave and we were with him.
keep him in here...
Oh I remember...
can he leave the room with us?
Look it's  simple.
and you'll come and get him.
Until I come and get him.
to leave the room...
even if you come and get him.
No It's nothing!
Well Look I'm afraid I really ought to be...
Well look er I...
It's not a very good name is it?
Look - I'm fine!
Well she's got a point.
I'm sorry I must go.
Back to your bed!
There's nothing wrong with...
Well  what seems to be the trouble?
I knew that someone would come.
somewhere out there...
there must be...
I have come to take you...
You've said it!
We've said it...
Stop saying it.
I've said it...
They're all saying the word...
Stop saying the word!
Did I tell you?
The names you called me.
I done it again.
Oh nobody really.
Er That's...
How can I stop now?
She's other people to look out for her.
You should have someone look after you.
She means it.
You know nothing about her!
Come on man I'm telling you what you already know.
Aye she may say that to you but the woman can say what she wants.
Oh I'm much more than that.
You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
And she sent no word down?
You want to be careful.
Aye but will they?
It's the same order every week but does anybody bother to check it?
You work the system right you could ask her yourself.
Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
The good-looking one.
There's love and there's...
Three years John.
How about yourself?
Seventy a year.
I hope to go up next year.
Yeah she's a lovely girl.
And is she all right?
Yeah yeah I did.
Yeah there's a good girl.
Out of my way!
Talk to her there.
She's busy.
I wish to see my mother.
And that is my last word on the matter.
He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed.
It is quite late enough.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
This is my place.
That can wait till the weekend.
Yes it most certainly is!
What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
You know that very well.
I need a man who knows where I am.
Who'll bring it to me?
How will I know?
In time she will.
She'll never understand it.
For once in my life I am not the issue.
Too busy looking after themselves.
Her mind is set.
Why do you think I keep her here?
I do what I do.
This is the top.
Your wife should not have let you out.
I've been called back to London.
My last day.
You sent for me.
Someone has to look after you.
It could've been someone.
It was before.
Then why send me back to them?!
All I've ever thought about is you!
I will not hear any more about my safety!!
Have I ever let you down before--?
I do not accept.
Dear me you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Must they always follow us?
What is it John?
To keep out the cold.
They're ready now.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.
Just say what you have to say woman.
I do not do it for others.
I am told so.
How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
Those over there there.
They all wish it.
He thought so yes.
That will be company for you.
You have a brother in service here do you not?
I forget his name.
She's well too.
You are well?
Oh several things.
I came as quickly as I could.
In so many ways...
Is that not enough?
Then they may read about me.
In the press perhaps.
Where is the old girl?
The question is do we need her?
Where did you find it by the way?
I think I'd best take it back.
Dear oh dear.
A fine choice sir.
I asked what was wrong with my son.
In no way did I wish to suggest--
Cold is good!
Why was I not told earlier?
How long has he been this sick?
I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
standing by his horse.
What is he doing there?
There is one other matter.
Who told them that?
And now I am back.
I shall be out walking.
Of course at once.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
What is the matter with him?
Then why are you not with him?
Why is he not here?
He gets you and you're dead.
Here they are...
But what can I do for you?
Does that thing work?
Maybe he's not dead.
It's really not all that important.
But how can it change every time?
What's the question mark?
Every game's got 'em.
Something's wrong with the game Mr.
Now what seems to be the problem?
Be careful what you say kids...
I know where you live.
How'd you know it was us?
I came from the city on the left.
Did you come from the city on the left or the city on the right?
It's fifteen after.
We always meet here you know that.
He's probably outside.
You know how he is.
I just thought of something.
If we came back from the game...
There never is.
One of them anyway...
So that's what we almost died for?
There's nothing here!
Our time's up.
Check your read-out.
And we've still got time left.
It's West.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Always wanted to do that.
You feel it?
It's different this time.
And what if something happens to you?
I know how to do this!
That's what it wants.
Put in a quarter.
It wants us to play the game.
And make it quick okay?
You realize that in order to do that we'd actually have to play the game.
It's still a game right?
It thinks like a game.
Then where do we go?!
The Police then...
It's already out.
We have to stop it from getting out.
I want to try something.
Then leave her.
Let's go around back.
Where to now?
We'll see what's up.
Life's too short know what I mean?
If they're sick great.
But let's make sure.
We have to find out what's happened to them.
I think they're gone...
It'll make sense.
We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's the middle of the night.
Something's happened to them.
Call the others.
I do have parents you know.
See men always do this.
I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
So how did it know my name then?
And maybe he's in trouble.
It said my name.
How could it know?
Turn if off!
I'm in the middle of it...
Can you turn off the game?
Something's happened to him.
It's twelve-thirty!
No in person.
We are talking...
I think the game has something to do with it.
Have you played the game yet?
But he was playing the game.
I mean you saw him...
So take his car home.
I'm sure he's up to something...
Well it's a long story...
Never come back.
So tell me you're okay then.
They're full of shit.
It's here!!!
In this world wrong is right!
It's the wrong way!
Then we'll go home.
Then we'll go home?
Did you play the game?!
You have no time.
What is your question?
but which one is which?
That's not it!
Is that your question?
What did he do to you?
is that where we are?
I never wanted to leave.
I want so much to be with you...
So how do I start?
A man after my own heart.
Straight to the point.
But you're the people that make it happen.
I am giving her a chance.
Give her a chance will you?
So start at the beginning...
Where should I take you?
I can say all sorts of things...
That's what they said I was.
I'll find a place.
that would not be a good idea.
I'll call him then call you back...
If you want you could stay at my place.
It is that kind of a day.
Will you meet with him?
Sort of funny boy.
Someone called me.
What do you mean ""you know""?
Someone's shut off my money!
Please come to the office.
There must be something we can do.
Meet me at the office.
We've got to do something...
everybody's gone.
They sent everybody home.
And you'd better speak to someone too...
or find yourself another client!!
No one's getting that film!!
I'll speak to someone.
you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
I'm in the middle of making a picture.
until we meet again.
So this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
It will work out.
Now I know a few things.
Can ya do that for me?
Okay I'm thinking.
Well just stop for a little second and think about it.
Will ya do that for me?
I agree with what you said...
Well now here's a man who wants to get right to it.
Have a good evening Mr.
I'll check out in the morning.
So what did they say?
how'd they know I was here?
The fact is Mr.
Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name...
It completely went out of my mind.
You remember last night.
Sometimes she's wrong but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
she's very nice.
I told ya.
it's a good one.
It's written all over that pretty face of yours..
he called me to check in said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in.
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.
No no I'm fine.
Shall we get to it?
I'd like you to meet everyone.
That's what you said from the beginning.
If I tell what happened...
I can call them...
I can call my dad.
You're still here?
Like it was with that girl what's her name with the black hair.
That felt good.
May I have your name please?
Can you tell me what happened?
Yes there was.
She's still got some of my stuff.
Just walk down that way.
It's just to the right.
It sounds kind of nice...
You have to start all over again.
I know what you have to do but let me do it.
I'll open the front door.
Go around to the back.
Do you know them?!
Those men in front in the car.
What do you see?!
I'd just get in trouble.
it's better not to get in trouble.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.
Is it bad for you that I'm here?
You've got to eat something.
""What about you?
What will your dad think about you?
Get out before I call my dad...
your his best friend.
This will be the end of everything...
""You know what I want...
it's not that difficult.
""I can call them...
I can call my dad...
""My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left...
""I came back.
""You're still here?
I know you're afraid of something.
We'll be careful.
Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
I'm not sure about this.
but I know her.
Call the number.
Maybe it's not me.
We'll take our check.
Just the coffee.
There's nothing?
let's find you something to wear.
just to see.
There must be a police report.
We could call.
When you think about them...
does it make you remember anything?
No  There is something...
There are things there....
but I'm...
How do you remember how to talk?
I think about that sometimes...
I remember walking here sort of.
Now I remember this place and you.
That's about it.
what do you think about then?
well what do you think about?
All right but...
But this could be serious.
She sure is.
You can imagine how I feel.
She has pretty red hair...
she is very kind I think.
it's none of my business.
thank you very much.
and we do.
We want to go in and turn right at the first street.
Now do we have name?
What's  the matter now?
Yeah what for?
You're so easy.
No no no I told you.
They're all real happy.
Look what happened to them.
So you came to see if he's out there?
it's the second one I've had but they were both the same......
they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night.
in back of this place.
he's the one that's doing it.
I can see him through the wall.
You see what I mean...
I just wanted to come here.
Find out who they are?
Well he said...
you know in his way...
Yeah that's a funny story.
It was just a thing.
so you're looking good.
I'll never be able to win this shit.
You must come in first place to move on!
Watch your hands and feet.
What do you have today?
Yeah I'd say that's it.
Well I'll see you at the next staff party.
I still have an office and secretary.
That was eleven years ago.
I work here remember?
What are you DOING here?
It'll end.
Just stop it.
End it here.
Then go right over to that corner.
The door will open and go in and up.
Your business is just as bad.
I was just part of a team.
I was doing my job...
I wanted to let his family know....
What do you do with the company if I might ask?
How can you just take a life?
This is New York.
I've since changed my mind.
It's a tax write off.
There are other things too.
Did they make you take one?
how does it feel?
It was there clear as day.
I just knew something was wrong.
Do you have something better to talk about?
Is this really the time?
Why did you build this whole place?
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes.
Give or take a few.
Obviously but what's the way out?
Look there's another train.
They'll send it through here.
So you're telling me you were set up?
I knew something was wrong.
Why would he?
It has nothing to do with me.
I'm talking to you!
And no so are we.
It's paid for by First Bank.
Who the hell are you anyway?
Give me a fucking.....
Come on it works.
You have issues.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do?
How do we get out of this room?
Now where do we go?
I'm not fucking him..
Leave him he's dead.
I made this place.....
now listen to me.
Take it all the way up.
Look you two get out of here.
It's fine thanks.
There's one right over there.
I thought you made this place?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
What exactly is on the other side of the door?
They're all wrong.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
That's very funny sir.
Yes can I help you?
I'm sick of playing.
I still think that's our in...
Any police record?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Who put you up?
Who gave you a job?
I was made in the Family okay.
Not down here.
When you are ready.
When will that be?
When I think you're ready.
I said NO.
But he's...
He'll never get it right.
Are you my mother?
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
We will start work on it now sir.
Which will it be?
One moment dear...
Is it as good as I hope it is?
That my boy is the best part.
What then sir?
I want more action.
That was rather....
Son let's watch the tape.
but this this is really personal.
I have had that kind of money all of my life.
I am thirty two.
Thank you  sir.
Sir may I ask you a question?
Yes sir I do.
Perhaps it was.
Not that well sir.
Go in there?
How can this happen?
The power went out in half the park.
No one's ever made it this far before.
Okay I have five that says THIS is it for them.
How will you know if they've made it?
I can see that but where?
Did you see!
Was that the Old Man?
Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
I can see your small business!
Look at it it's so small.
The night is young....
I'll see that bet.
I do believe Mr.
I have a turn for the worse for the team!
Will he make it out?
I was just getting  well you know.
Just saying hello.
I mean listen to this.
"" or ""You came in that thing?
Son of a.....
Who was that guy anyway?
He was right behind me!
Where do we go now?
""How's your foot""?
How's your foot?
Which door gets us out of here??
I just need to sit and think for a second.
I think we should follow him...
Just get up.
Okay now go under go under it!
Get Him Get Him!
I just want to have something that's mine you know?
I have always had a lot of money.
You have a real nice place...
Dinner at my place then?
On a date?
It's sounds so much better when you say it.
Will you go out with me?
Do you want to go out with me?
Listen I was thinking you know.
Would you go it's I think you're...
Come on I'm serious.
I meant him.
Maybe we should make the time.
We start with the top and work our way down.
Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to....
How long have you been with the company now?
Actually it's down.
People said she looked like me.
No no no I gave it up ten years ago...
actually it gave me up.
Oh just put it over there.
Tell them that...
Put that down I'll...
I'll call the police!
Where is he??
He was supposed to meet me.
How did you know my name?
Me I'll know!
You're still asking me to break the law.
I'm sorry okay...
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
All you have to do is make a phone call.
What about giving the other guy a break.
But let me tell you something.
I would do it again in a minute.
Could you hold on for a second?
Well we worked on the school paper together.
What do you remember about her.
You're his sister.
We have a baby?
She just had a baby that's all.
bye daddy I love you.
Oh she's fine...
told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...
just to make sure that...
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Thanks I needed that.
Bye Dad I'll miss you.
So you're saying...
What are you saying??
It's just a question it's not about anybody.
No it's okay I understand really.
No I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could...
What makes you think there's something on my mind?
So what's on your mind?
Well you know what I mean.
Okay no problem.
Well not far just down the hall.
You want me to move?
Dad I'm trying.
Oh she's fine she'll love her new room.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
They sure did!
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I'm sorry it's just...
sometimes it gets out of hand.
It's okay really I was just a baby.
it got to be a real problem with us.
Do you think I'm your father?
and then I was born so I thought that...
I'd say you turned out just fine.
I thought that...
Would you like...
everything went wrong.
I've got something better.
That's all right you know what?
I told you it was a long story.
Oh she's great...
How's she?
Yeah come on let's talk.
She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'd like to thanks.
can you come in for a minute?
You mean you knew about me?
My mother was...
Sure am who are you?
Then what did she do?
He's all yours!
Is it okay if I drink this?
Then I have come to the right place.
we are the best.
can I help you?
He's writing.
It's no problem I had a mother once myself.
This is really very nice of you.
How's your report coming?
I never met my mother.
It's about not giving up and...
that's when we should...
You think this is easy for me?
You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy.
But we made a business deal.
Listen I'm sorry...
well it's not...
it's yours...
is my real father.
look at me I have the hair of a dead person and...
but maybe it does.
If no one told me about this I mean...
it was me.
just tell me what to do I'll do anything.
but on you it looks good.
My hands fit.
You mean  this ring?
Just come and get it...
Just give it to me!!
I want it back now.
I never should have taken it off I want it back.
Well I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Well he was a boy he was my friend...
he was my best friend.
Does it work?
Hey what do I care...
Oh no wait I like that you bought me here.
Boy you're really into this.
May I use the phone please.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state?
Just ask him.
What you think the guy should change his name?
Change my name.
Can we go?...
Look here she is.
We just have to ask ourselves where your books come from.
Getting off please.
Sounds great well you give 'em both one of these for me.
take your time...
I'll go for a walk around.
I should do this myself.
You want me to come with?
Well I've come this far...
you'll decide.
I'd like to see his house but...
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I had to be I only have five days.
good to know.
Did he take good care of you?
They're great.
Is that a yes?
What I'm try...
I think this place is just fine.
You know exactly...
what kind it is.
We have a date every night.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee like a real date when was the last time you did that?
in front of the children.
Oh yeah sure help yourself.
Then you'll be all set.
She'll be all right baby.
I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Go to your room.
I'll see you then...
Oh sure okay.
and beautiful women.
you do like...
Let's just say I...
I'm involved.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Oh no I I...
Well maybe for you.
It's all in the hands really.
Oh you mean you...
with your car.
Nothing nothing at all.
Let me hold him.
I know look at his little hands.
You leave your father to me.
But Dad'll never go for it.
But what about you and the baby?
Why not now?
Well it must mean something.
It's not easy being a woman.
No the milk comes when the baby comes.
Is there milk in them already?
I would have tried to show her a good time.
Well thanks for your help Mr.
I wish it did.
He'll remember my mother for sure.
I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Good for you baby.
All right here.
You're such a baby.
It's her home!
Yeah all right...
What am I doing here?????
I know that but what do you want from me?
Open your eyes she's eleven years old!
Her only friend in the world is dead.
Yep there they are...
They always look the same every year...
You can get the general idea...
Well you were pretty great!
I'm looking forward to that.
Want to what?
Is there enough room?
This is where we are.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
I did it myself.
Would you like to come in and see my house?
I had a good time tonight.
Oh how do you mean?
Does it make it easier to win?
I'll let you get back to work.
Oh right right.
I'm sure she will.
And the room's all set up.
Well the other night at dinner...
What do you mean??
I think she looks nice!
Could you take a look at Mrs.
Great you can start right away.
Oh You still want it?
They're dead?
I think it's still available.
It's still available I hope?
She was pretty and kind she had your eyes.
I found this.
Get away get away!!
There were just too many of 'em.
He's getting big.
Are they ready yet?
Can I go too?
I love this guy!
It's for school for summer writing class.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Then who's it for?
Is it for a child?
It can only mean one thing.
No no no....
Go get 'em.
Oh I'm running late.
Are you sure about all this?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh yes oh that's great.
Will you tell her I came by?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Come here sit down over here.
For this class?
I paid the money.
It's summer!
You're kids!
What do you get for that?
Well you never can tell...
This is one big house for one single person.
Why do you think she says that?
Do you think she is?
So you fill it with water like this and what have you got?
My Dad was funny?
Yes I do and I think she's very good for your father.
Do you like her?
Does he love her?
Okay get in to bed.
It's okay come on upstairs we have to have a little talk.
I'm eleven and a half.
Well he just left what's wrong?
I won I won!!!
Well I'm no doctor.
I like my name.
All right open your eyes.
They'll come around.
Come here sit down.
Have you ever tried any?
Did you read ALL these books?
My ball I lost my ball.
Maybe black means you're happy?
I will never play with those girls.
Would you think of me?
You better not either.
Okay enough practice.
Maybe we should just to see what's the big deal.
Well when you get older you just have to.
It's not fair.
Nothing happens to boys.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Leave then some friend you are.
Then go home baby.
I do she's real funny.
So now you'll have a mother.
Why are you running away?
But I have my clothes on!
What do you want it for anyway?
I'll get you!!!!
Can we go yet?
I stopped that!
I told you i'll get in trouble.
What do you think it's like?
Do you remember her?
Who's that with your Dad?
Is that your Dad?
Hey where does it say that?
Hey look at this!
Walk me over.
What's wrong with your eyes?
If I do it can we go?
Yeah he got away.
Big deal I can do that too.
You're like a dog!
You just go home to eat.
It's not dinner time yet.
Hey look at this no feet!
I'll call George's parents.
Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
Well I'm close to her.
I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Pretty nice of you to come.
I should look different.
Well then I'll take it up with her.
Yeah it's in the contract.
Oh you're more than okay.
I did what I came to do.
And what will he do?
Tell him you're afraid of love.
Tell him you love him.
With all your heart.
It's too late to start over.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
That was Thursday.
Try less appropriate.
I KNOW THAT!
Let's not get carried away.
The man you love.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.
And you believe that.
And it will be there every...
Go figure you.
You like her.
When I'm talking to children.
We'll never be the same.
We're about to find out.
He's still in love with you.
No he's nothing like me.
He's like you.
Nine years we've seen each other through everything.
The best times of my life maybe.
Even over a phone.
Like for two months.
It's who I leave out.
I never want to go through this again.
Have you ever heard of.
In one minute.
If you're waiting for ""Do you take this man?
This must be...
very very hard on him.
They'll eat it anyway you ever been to a walk?
If he wants to.
He'll see right through it.
What you said.
one almost has to...
But he always says...
Forget I brought it up.
I just think you're wrong is all.
About Michael's job.
This guy always knows the best everything.
Which works out great.
And the answer was so simple.
You'll always be there.
In his mind.
I'll take your word.
He says it's worse than ever.
Just to top it off.
He said that too.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.
Right from the start.
What else did he tell you...
Can you watch the road?
I can be quick.
I can even be funny.
Well we're...
From some guy who thinks he saw her?
I saw the show.
That was a...
Could I use...
Well you're a little early...
a problem have I?
Nobody should be in on this.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.
Sir this is important!
Is anybody watching?
But they're good people they're starting with love.
They've got time.
May be hard.
For you to explain.
If you find her...
Like her life is over.
It's two weeks.
Why would she come here...
I came here looking for her.
I just wanted you to...
I mean do you realize what you've...
how could you do that?
wrote it yeah.
I'm the bad guy.
You're not saying you actually...
I saw that moving...
You never want to do that see that's always a...
Well it happens.
Thank God you were here.
It just has to be love.
Does that make it right...
I asked you...
And your point?
Look I came down here to face everybody.
Or we'll go somewhere.
If you have the time.
Should we take a walk?
Or maybe some food sent up or something...
No it's for the best it really is.
We were so wrong for each other.
""Maybe you should take the job.
Please put her on?
It means a lot.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
Nobody's doing business.
We could use...
his computer to...
That's my point!!
Will she like it?
Takes me back.
So we heard it...
like right that...
I'll check.
And then it seems like...
You forget you...
And I was thinking this could be our last time.
You've been the man in mine.
You've sort of been...
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.
About us actually.
Does it really?
Never can tell.
You have a date, after this?
Boy, those were the days.
That would be a girl.
I got the point.
She would never.
Even think of that.
all of it.
I'm cheap, remember?
First girl I ever knew.
She makes the bed.
My very point.
Here's another one...
see that's what I thought at first.
Day after day year after year...
Please come please.
Actually it all starts tomorrow.
You've met her parents.
But they're so down to earth such wonderful people...
Like when I first met you.
And she's all wrong for me!
I've never felt this way about anybody!
and you knew about this.
It would only be maybe six months?
Or three or four?
It would mean so much to him...
He never mentioned that.
The most important thing.
Is being together.
Well the school will be here.
You're much more his type.
An so it is.
He said you told him.
We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Maybe it's happy there.
And yet here you are.
I hate that music.
Thought we'd get something for the kids.
What do you have to buy?
I remember when I just saw you.
Well it better not happen again.
Well that just happened that time.
Saturday's usually.
Is there food?
You're from out of town?
You're so good.
All those people...
You have to what?
Then why are you listening to her -
Well Bye Bye now.
I got them right here.
Thank you-- Yes I am.
I'll go on.
What did you say your name was?
They keep taking things out.
What's wrong with her.
You'll have to speak up.
How did you come in here?
What do you get out or this?
That's pretty close.
He knows better.
Well you did and she's fine.
Well I just thought I'd call.
I need a little information.
But ah it can wait.
Okay I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
I feel as if I know you.
If there's anything you need just give me a call.
Okay then we'll see you there.
You know better than that.
That's what he wants.
He came there?
Where'd he ever see us?
What's he running for?
Well I'm here putting together a show.
It's a benefit really.
It has nothing to do with support.
The Hell he did.
Look I'll see you in the morning.
At the park...
I'll just be in here.
Let me know when you do all right?
Put them here...
I'll take them.
Sure he will.
You want me to wait?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Can I go up?
How'd you get in here.
I'll see you in the morning.

My wife and I think so but we're family.
I think we can do that.

I said maybe I'll change my name again.

About three years.
How long have you been with them?
It just is.
Well can you tell me why?

When did you think it would happen?
In out/out in something like that.
End of Church Street.
Who is this right?
You said you wanted to see me.
Looks a little funny.
That's not quite what I had in mind.
You should come over to the house.
The boys would love to meet you.
I'd really like to see you.
Well I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
I'm sorry but I have to go.
They told me after.
That's all I need.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.

I'm forty-six.
Do you like to go up or down?
Just got out.
Been out three months.
Are you heavy?
Is that really you?
You are just a wonderful person.
Anyway you better take a break.

Probably a little too long.
How long have you been together?
Did it break?
No  Hell some secretary in New York just hands it to you.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
They want to start in two weeks.
Let's see what happens here.

You think it will?
If you're serious.
Being serious is real important.
Ten minutes okay?

Yes they were.
More or less...
I was a completely different person ten years ago.

This might work.
He knew it would work.
Did you think it would work?
What he said.
I mean it's not like we care.
You got something you want to do?
If we say move you move.
If we say left you move left.
If we say right you move right.
Now that you bring it up yes.
They were different men.
What do you think normally happens?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Who is we?
What's changed Mr.
So I ask you again Mr.
We're the who.
The why is simple.
And who made the decision?
Have we found our man?
So how do I fit into this scheme?
You've heard of it?
So can we.
All right Cut!
I know she's still here and I know you know where.
Okay it turned out to be nothing.
Make it happen!
It's video.
Do you have a back up.
Look I'll trade you.
How come you never talk?
We hate you.
Just wait one fucking minute.
You getting the idea?
You tell them that.
Okay let's cut it.
But you see they all missed the point of the story.
When have they ever been right?
What's up here?
I'm sure we will.
We'll move on and come back later.
You'll never understand.
I used to be you...
From where you're standing you're a man.
I'm right here...
you're somewhere else man.
You say why?
I say why not?
That's only part of it.
I mean it's a big big big part.
Was what worth it?
Then was it worth it?
What a stupid question.
Well something I used to do...
Let me think of something else.
Ask me something else.
We're about ready to go here.
Okay now before we get started here there's a few things we have to get clear about.
That's what I hear anyway.
It needs you.
And that time has definitely come.
' I am not one of those people.
Where does it all stop?
What I'd like to do---
Ever do one on him?
Everybody knows who you are.
And that's that!
I really want to.
But you can still get out of here.
And they made the first move?
So you may as well make the first move.
That's the way of the world.
Through the power of the simple word---
I'm taking one of these men.
They'll be there for when ya need 'em.
Yeah we met.
They're good men.
Are you all set?
What time you got?
This is great stuff.
Lose the rest.
Well basically what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Okay boys let's have it.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together.
But you'll never be whole again.
Probably the whole city.
But how can you say that?
Could we go with you and film it?
What's around here?
So we got a deal.
I'll cut it in half.
They hate him.
Even you and I feel it.
We got one...
I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well just what the hell do you expect me to do?
We're about two people having a conversation.
All I want you to worry about is what I ask you.
If you're thinking about all this...
Ya know I was.
Yep they're my kids and they're all I need.
Is that her real name?
You met the kids I have working for me?
Everything's coming along just fine.
How's everything coming Mr.
I need to talk with Mr.
We talked on the phone.
They done that too long in my family.
Want me to come?
You' a nice guy.
He's the money man.
All right you get out of here man!
Boy - you hear me?!
Fill her up?
Then do like I said.
Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.
Want to keep your job boy?
You got the wrong idea.
Used to be.
You a union man?
That's no way to talk boy.
Want to talk to you.
What did you say your name is?
Where was that?
You' new here man!
See you boys.
Well I thought it was.
What's the matter boy?
I said: Cut it out!
Where's he at?
I thought he was up North.
If I was maybe I'd feel different.
He's your boy.
Well she never gave me none.
Look you better find him a place pretty quick.
Door's open.
Just so you do your work.
Okay thanks very much.
Me an' her.
Any other family?
And his age?
Well he worked around.
Where was your father born?
Have anything in mind?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Yeah I been there.
Cup of coffee.
Like I said baby - I'll write you.
You'll be better off without me.
When I get set I'll send for you.
Well that'll be the first time.
Jesus baby you're so full of talk!
I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
What the hell could you do?
I could work even after the baby comes.
A few hours a week anyway.
When that baby comes I can just stay home and send you back to school.
You know - we do have enough money.
You can have what I've got.
It's right there.
How much money you got with you?
I'm telling you baby maybe we better get out of here.
I got to get me a job.
What about your boy?
That's just fine baby.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Go on - hit me!
Okay hit me!
Put 'em up!
You know how to box?
Baby you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Am I as good as they?
Come here baby.
I thought it was pretty good.
Yeah that's so.
He could live with us.
That's all right with me.
Hey watch out!
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
It's okay with me baby.
But a small one.
That's all over.
What about that girl?
I just know it is.
I'll have some coffee please.
How old is your boy?
Well good-bye.
Just for the day?
That's the way he is.
Might as well make it here.
You been there?
That's why I went out with you.
I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Oh yeah and then what?
You almost got into trouble back there.
But I would like to see you again.
It's better than it used to be.
It's a no-good town.
It's hard to see any change.
Another year anyway.
You got a problem all right.
must be about twenty-eight times.
Well they seem just like everyone else.
Go on - you can have one!
I like a place with lots of life.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Well that's a funny thing to say.
My mother's dead.
That's my home town.
I'm a teacher.
You work around town?
I'm new in town.
You must be new in town.
Like a home for one thing.
I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Yeah see you in hell.
Better get him to a hospital.
What you come and bother me for?
That's how me an' your mother got started.
They take it all away from you.
I said I come to town with a girl.
Heard you were in town.
What did you say boy?!
That's the trouble with you boys!
Jesus I told you to watch it!
She'll do.
Got to understand them that's all.
Want me to hold the light for you?
Hell I'm just like him.
I'll take the bus.
They'll run you out.
Want to come up the house?
You can stay there till you get on your feet.
Been like this for days.
Come back some other time will you?
How often is that?
How often does he get like that?
I'll be seeing you.
You' just half a man!
So I been told.
You'll be in trouble son.
Well you have to be reasonable.
I know just how you feel son.
Well that figures.
Yes the Lord's been pretty good to us.
Nice place you got here.
Well you've got to go easy.
Well it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Sit down son.
All right son.
Just give him a couple of months.
Hell they're all after the same thing.
Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Anything you say baby.
Now you stay put!
He's your son.
Got to see a man about a dog.
Is there baby?
Okay so what's a girl supposed to do?
Shut up Will.
Let's stay here Will.
You got some money?
He's my son!
You come in.
Get a look around.
Then I get my wife.
We been talking for eleven fucking hours man.
Your wife is on her way...
I want my wife.
I told you and told you.
Just keep talking.
That's not the play.
You can to save a man you love.
Take this off.
Then we would have talked you and I.
Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
Excellent but that's where Peter come in.
Once she's in...
What's an A.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about.
And how do you suggest I do that?
A free man.
Let's talk business.
I find out now.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
I'm not waiting until this is over.
Give it to me now or there's no run.
The run is tomorrow night.
She's very important to us.
Stick with her.
I want the process to become second nature to you.
Yeah well it's working.
Could be your A.
For now that's all you need to know.
Working with a dead man.
Shit I've done about everything else.
's but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
This one's different.
And no one would take on an A.
If they had a choice.
It's an A.
You have just long enough to do the job.
You're playing God with my body.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order.
First let's get something straight.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
I'd say you were full of shit.
For you or anybody else.
You of all people should know that.
What does this have to do with me?
I'd like to hear what it is.
Are you sure you're up to this Mr.
Then I'm out.
Now our time is running short...
Tell me the words.
My problem Mr.
Can you read my mind?
It'll keep us honest.
I saw your girl yesterday.
What's the last thing you remember?
As far as they know that's absolutely true.
It's Case.
Not meant for transport.
I an' I Case.
We need her.
We're doing fine.
Take the next right.
I an' I man.
I an' I.
But this man...
She's ready to go.
I'll get you there.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
I said it's coming.
Just get me in man.
You better be.
Meet me back here in twenty-five.
Less than thirty minutes.
How much time you got left?
Not good enough man.
Make it a good one.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
I got the I.
's you end up on tape.
Can you take me to it?
I'll make you a deal.
What about the A.
Can you run an I.
Who got you into this?
That makes you something special.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead.
Want to fucking answer them?
And this is...
Too many places.
Where did you here that?
This time it's different.
I hear that shit once a week.
People are talking.
You should be on it too.
There's nothing for us here Case.
There never was.
I thought you already left.
No It's you that is full of shit.
I think you're full of shit.
That's why I need you Case.
I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
I'll take you out.
That's exactly what I had in mind.
I found her to be...
You set me up from the beginning.
And we really do have to talk.
You're out of time man.
It's important to be able to feel those things.
I know you have.
Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Give me five minutes.
They'll cut you down.
I'll get the car.
it's four a.
It sounds like you.
I got no way back.
just pull this out.
I just needed to set the record straight.
only it was too late for him.
Once that goes down that's it.
He lost his business...
On a good run...
Why is it so important?
Like getting high.
They said two days.
The way I feel believe me it'll help.
How soon is soon enough?
did it work>
Almost two days.
you're not supposed to be up.
Maybe something's onto him.
money comes in.
He's onto something.
For someone else.
What about before that?
Couple of months.
How long you work for him?
What's my end?
Word on the street is you're a dead man walking.
Nice time for an employment opportunity.
Why should I want to meet him.
Why would we want to go there and stand around?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
That's the old drive-in.
They call it ""The Court"".
We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
Why do they listen to Guy?
How long will they watch us for?
Well do you?
When it's not yours.
I have enough work here to last me all night.
Who knows what that is?
I'm just making conversation.
We need a new idea.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you.
Class is over already.
I like a man who gets to the point.
They're behind you.
They feel like they know you.
No thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
You need my help?
Yeah but I'm okay.
I've got some work to do.
How many of us get to go back to high school?
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece that's all.
Felt that thing--
The right guy is out there.
When is the last time you went on a real live date?
And what is your policy?
That if you're not getting any no one can?
Oh-my-God.
They're so--different.
From ""As You Like It""?
I'll tell you a story.
We've got nothing.
And that's the best part.
He's my teacher!
That's your story!
Now listen--you're in over your head.
Get to know them.
Your job and my job depends on it.
Do you even know these kids?
Have you been there?
It's my dad.
Hey--I can be out of control.
You're all about order.
You've done five of my ideas.
Yeah he's--good.
It means ""with hope"".
Computer's down.
I need it back by five.
You said that already.
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Quite a guy.
That's big.
You know what though?
I feel like I'm really ready to do it.
I got you everything you wanted.
I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I never thought--
And what are -
You're twenty-three years old!
Better than I...
That you can go in there be friends with them and get your story?
Little known fact.
It's not that hard.
All you need is one person.
I came up with it.
It was a long time ago -
Do you remember high school?
Back to high school.
This must be big.
It's just for a couple of months.
For your information I am very happy.
And then I could be as happy as you!
How can you just give up like that?
I know this woman.
Better person than I.
No it is.
It's just one more thing to add to your ""things that make you a better person than me"" list.
Look you could get to know me again.
I'm the same person!
I thought I found her--the right one!
And the problem was she was too young!
For a story.
"" you were doing a story on me?!
Yeah I have.
Well are you here with anybody?
They're so final.
You just have to find your story.
You believe in me that much--
Do you think you'll find her?
To watch the world go by.
That's really what we all need right?
Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
He had to sit on that wall all by himself.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
You're my teacher.
It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.
God I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher.
That's what makes you interesting.
As a teacher.
Okay This is okay.
I remember everything from your class.
You remember that story?
When you speak in class I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here.
That's--really nice to hear.
For your writing.
So what are you thinking for college?
Well I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Are you sure you're seventeen?
But I think she wanted to be happy that's why she wrote.
I mean she was still writing about love right?
It's really hard to do.
Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Into our group.
It's just my sister.
I've been in it over thirty years.
I want you to be my first.
Me and you.
Maybe we should sit.
Everybody knows about--
We went through the door...
<i>                      I've got something listen now This one is real good you'll see.
Where're we taking him?
<i>                      Three of a kind...
Of course I could.
But no one would be like you...
me your own father...
But I have to go out.
Something's happening out there.
Just me I suppose...
Of course you do and I want you to...
I have to leave some time.
If you went away what would become of me?
You're mine you know.
I made you.
I'm always right you know my dear...
I thought I'd find you here....
--              Will it break?
<i>                      That's the point of the thing not to know!
-- What's in it?
--                What's in it?
<i>                      -- A box?
<i>                      This is a thing called a present.
The whole thing starts with a box...
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!
We're here!
You sent for us!
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?
It's not the gas Dad!
Help me with this thing!
Oh come on Dad...
Just out for a while.
We've only been living here six weeks now.
It's getting there.
Come back here!
Alright then what is it?
Come back to me.
He's in there and I want him back.
I want him back.
his me over the head if you have to.
I'm in trouble here.
But there's something trying to get into my body.
That place is bad news.
So you live around here.
Could be all night.
He's been trying to get hold of me to use me.
He needs me to get out of his world into ours...
Who's doing this to you?
he's just waiting to take me.
We'll figure it out together.
We'll stay up all night if we have to.
You're not being fair to me.
I'm just not into it tonight.
There's nothing to figure out.
I wish you'd talk to me.
We can figure it out you know.
We can figure it out together.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
yeah I had a bad night.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
What is it - What's wrong?
Maybe we can do that.
Now there's an idea we can take off on.
I'll get over it.
Does that go into the air too?
Make a left at this corner.
What's all this.
I just got here myself.
You think that's what it is?
But I'll see you in the morning right?
Are you okay.
Before my time.
That's okay I wanted to.
Look at this car.
Can I go to bed now?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Just really hot upstairs.
I'll need to take her things.
I thought I'd wait for you.
What are you still doing up?
It's past one.
Now get in bed.
He's full of shit.
It's past one!
I've been good.
Just tonight please?
Wait and see.
Girl what are you doing?
Last time it was me against him.
No she's right.
Do you still...
see each other?
It was great seeing you again.
To old friends.
I'm busy with school.
But I'll never forget the old ones.
I think new York was just what I needed.
So many people.
He's close...
Let's try this way.
He's too strong!
He was never this strong!
I can feel him.
You just forget how to use it.
Will you try?
You did it the other night.
Yeah but I was really not good.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
I was on the team at school.
I was never very good though.
When I was a little girl.
Have you ever done that before?
Thank you for what you did last night.
I used to live in this house.
I -- I think so!
You got five minutes.
It'll be my last chance.
It could mean life or death.
She made that real clear.
You need me I'll be here all night.
I just wanted to be here for the kids.
how are they?
you're in the wrong place.
That's your office.
After all this time.
Stop running away from it.
I lost too much over this already.
I'm through with it.
I think we can stop him this time.
Stop him for good.
He's doing it again.
You're the one who's trying to forget.
Yeah but here you are.
How'd I get so lucky?
You saw how he is.
Just give me a minute.
There's only one man...
and its time for him to talk.
That's exactly what he wants.
And even if it is...
what the hell am I doing here?
Everybody take five.
We can try again.
Remember -- open mind.
Then maybe you're ready.
and they are.
you have no business taking it yourself.
Just until we get things under control.
That's what I know.
That's a new one.
My father an I...
your parents still live around here?
Never been here before?
Well we've got --
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow.
Tell me about the kids.
Okay straight talk only in here.
Starting with him.
And what are they?
Somebody else is out here.
How do we get in?
We knew no one would ever find it.
I'm not even sure I can find it again.
You said something before...
and with child.
What was this place?
Only one thing can save the children.
I come from time to time.
When I'm needed.
just try to help the kids will you?
Listen to them.
You brought this on yourself.
It's my decision.
What has she talked you into?
Straight talk only in this room.
I know these kids.
They never said...
What did we ever do?
Why is he after us?
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Lovely to meet you.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
That was such a great evening.
guy from the past.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
And then I...
I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
So that's...
On the high side...
I mean last film you did what did you get paid?
It's no life.
Well they can be.
That's very good news.
Yes I'm pretty sure I would.
And what would you say...
Everyone in the world knows who you are.
You'd go and I'd be...
Yes that's fine.
be getting along then...
nice to see you.
or a lot maybe...
see if you could...
like me again.
What's the thing?
Okay -- well thank you.
But thank you anyway.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Everything much the same.
how have you been?
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave...
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
there are things to say.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
This is certainly...
Well you know -- it's just one day.
You're right: of course you're right.
And wait a minute...
Have a cup of tea.
Who knows it may even help business.
I know I know -- but...
As far as they're concerned I do.
How do you think I'm doing?
' Do you feel that?
they're odd-looking.
They're for milk.
Your mum's got them.
More than that actually when you think about it.
Every second person in the world has got them...
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
You and every person in this country.
thought you were someone else.
Anyway -- time for bed.
It's one hell of a job.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Always have had.
You've got big feet.
Well done you.
Hand it over.
It's all talk talk talk.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Is that the film you're doing?
Oh no no -- no.
I have thought about you.
Well there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I'm really sorry about last time.
We'll sort it out.
Now what would you like -- tea...
they make me look like...
You've got to go.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
There are lots of reasons.
Do you want to come up?
No you were brilliant
I love that you tried...
time was I'd have done the same.
She saw through me.
So who left who?
Let's go in.
You know I'm not sure.
It's to do with the hair.
I'm sure it's all right.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
No I mean if it's fine with you I'll you know be your date.
But no I'm sure I can get out of it.
Oh well great.
That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.
Well it was nice to meet you.
Are you busy tonight?
Absolutely fine about it.
I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
the film's great...
I brought these but clearly...
okay let's give it a try.
I mean I'll tell myself sometimes but...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
That's my house there.
I also have a phone.
I need to get my car back.
Here let me help.
This one though is...
I'll just look around.
Is this a problem?
no thank you.
Would you like my phone number?
Does the girl have a name?
We're lucky in lots of ways but...
Yes I think that one may be.
Tony -- what do you think?
Do you want to stay?
Oh no -- this is just getting worse.
that she was just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.
Well you know anybody saying they want to go out with you is...
Yes -- sort of...
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Is this your first film?
I was called and I came.
By the way -- it's you.
Good move: when all is said and done she's nothing special.
See you tonight.
Well thanks that's great.
You can ring her.
You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Have we got something for you.
No I'm sure it'll be fine.
Well yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Have you got a moment?
Well fire away.
Did you like the film?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
But it's not for the shop.
Right -- want another one?
he was quite a long way away.
Yes better get me a half.
All I can afford.
So not over her in fact.
I believe I have.
There are dead people on better form.
Is it someone we know?
This was always a no-go situation.
No -- did you?
I think you do yes.
I have him in my mind.
No that's right -- I know that.
Does she know you're coming?
Well there are.
Just take my work for it.
Might be too late but okay.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
No -- you're right.
You think it's the wrong moment.
Do you mind if I have a go?
And you get on very well.
And she's in your house.
I wonder if I could have a little word.
Speak on dear friend.
There's this girl...
Did you find them?
Oh shit is that the time?
Absolutely no idea.
No one else?
Oh no wait.
You should do more of this stuff.
Okay -- just one more.
wait for it...
First there's this one...
No -- they're...
Are you sure you...?
what can I say?
The question of...
depends on the question...
Let's get it all out in the open...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Tell us about it...
Would you like to start?
and it's a hit!
It's a hit!
What the hell does that have to do with it?
I'm not finished yet.
Down it goes.
Now who will start?
I'm sure we'll be friends.
All in good time.
This is your bed.
Will you come with me please.
In ya go...
Remember this is just between you an' me.
Do ya understand?
Yeah well well well.
This is too much!
Does anybody else know?
Go with him.
What's there to decide?
You can go with him.
Hey what's that?
They must be up there!
They went that way.
That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Did ya see that!
I second the motion!
How many ya want?
Like hell we will!
Yeah my feet are cold...
You can come back later!
I just started!
I said out!
I was open!
Come on let's play ball!
What are you talking about???
I said pass the ball!
Oh yeah the plan...
Send me a post card.
An' put it in!
So why are you talking to him?
You heard me the first time!
With your own two hands?
With this thing!
That's between me an' myself.
I got some planning to do.
It is to me!
What's the use!
In fact she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
And you're just the man for the job right?
Now what would I be trying to say?
Did to me?
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Let me see your hand!
Just wait till you hear...
Now you watch me.
I saw 'em!
I saw 'em.
Hold it a minute.
Okay who wants a card?
a lovely lady...
Yeah it's cold!
We'll let you know.
In fact I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
' What do you say to that?
'  What do you think of that report?
Ah do you know why you're here?
Oh what was that?
Ah who are you?
Now down it goes...
Oh stay back!
Hold it down!
Somebody's coming!
It's the way out.
You're on!
Yeah yeah show me.
Show me how!
You want me to show ya!
You want me to show ya how!

Ah believe ya brother.
Ah believe ya!
You's better believe it brother!
Come an' see.

You know I never got your name.
Please follow me.
Here please take these.
See ya around!
Well listen to this.
Now tell me!
Like it in here?
Come on let's get 'em!
Yes I see it!
Hit you say?
You better believe it...
If you understand what I mean...
That's what I told his mother.
He was a very sick man.
I would say yes.
Not exactly Miss.
Keep it down...
Is this really real?
Oh no Miss.
let's move it away from the window...
She was your sister.
He is your husband no?
But it's here now.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.
it's just very important that I find him okay?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
You ask what room he's in okay?
She thinks he's here.
Even though she's never met him.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
So what's the story with your friend?
Let's find a telephone.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
And he was...
But now everything's changed.
I need to tell him.
And the last line of it goes ""Who knows?
From high school.
That's how I knew you were here.
And he's a friend of yours.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
That's all I need to know.
If she has a telephone number?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Right he's...
not what you think--
We'll KNOW.
And stop talking.
I have to write this down.
Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it.
Lots of history.
So this is what you do?
I mean when you're not playing other parts?
My picture's up?
I knew that was too much.
My name's
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.
Who should I tell him called?
He's not in at the moment.
Is anybody there?
I brought you that too.
There is no us.
I did it for us...
If you had wanted to you'd have gone home.
And what if I had wanted to?
And this is the thanks I get.
We're talking about love okay?
You're the one who lost him remember?
You're the reason I never met him.
I thought we had something here.
No one had to tell me.
I'd call that a yes.
In that case...
Are you asking me out?
I mean yes I'm not.
I decided to call it off.
No it was more than that.
It was very kind.
How about music?
The Old Man and the--
Well what about books?
You found somebody.
I found somebody.
I thought we could double.
Thank you Peter.
Well have a good time.
Anyway that's why I came by.
I just met somebody myself.
Do you want me to do it?
He's here with his mother.
I'd really rather not say.
I just want to make this up to you.
Let me do this for you.
It's in the south.
I can get you there by morning...
So I called there they said he left yesterday.
Leave me out of it.
We're not the ones who are meant to be.
There must be something I can do something I can say to make this up to you?...
Just tell me what it is I'll say it.
Does he  know who you are?
Why are you asking me this?
Does he love you?
To the foot doctor.
If it's any of your business yes.
You want some help?
I'm in love with you.
That was before I found out what it was.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
You want me.
So what are we waiting for?
What looks good?
Well to-- new friends.
See you then then.
I'll look forward to it.
I just got here too.
But just now.
Yeah we just got here...
I mean I just got here.
I'm single.
Just since yesterday.
He told me what happened.
Have you seen Peter?
I've just been thinking...
I ought to be getting home anyway.
Maybe I can change him.
No I think maybe you've been right.
Okay we'll be there.
How is he anyway?
Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?
Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Peter found him?
I'll be back before you leave.
Thank you for being such a good friend.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet that's all.
What about Peter?...
I've got forty-eight hours.
This is no time to give up.
Men have ways.
But how could he know?
He only just met me.
They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
I meant about my idea.
Okay here's what I think.
It's meant to be right?
Is he looking at us?
You join him.
But first will you ask if he's here?
I never even got to be single.
So what's in a name?
You see I'm trying to find someone and--
I still hope that.
But maybe I was wrong.
What's that supposed to mean?...
So we should've been able to cover more of them.
What'd you find?
Maybe there's something in there that might help us.
Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Just once more so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
We lost him?...
Well we're here.
We'll cut back on everything else.
It's called...
I mean what's the big deal?
You're coming with me?
My God you have...
Would you stop saying that?
I got one nine years ago.
I just never had an opportunity to use it.
What about your job?
It's still the new year...
I can just tell.
Have you seen him with someone?
Is that bad?...
Not for you not for anybody.
Let me tell you something about love.
Love is hard work.
Look how big it makes me look.
Come on it's not so bad.
He's never asked me.
That's what you're waiting for?
Have you ever been out with him?
So he's not my type.
And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
So what's your point?
Look at your brother and me.
But we work it out.
How about that guy at the bank?
How about the other one?
He's around somewhere.
That's exactly what you are.
But I do want to.
It's been wonderful meeting you.
I have a life I have to go back to.
What do the years matter?
I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink but--
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.
Can you tell us what she's saying?
This is your most lucky day.
And you are?...
He missed me.
I came after the woman I love.
She'll never speak to me again.
Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Went to high school with him.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?
I wanted to get to the next question.
That's why you're here?
That's what made this country great.
Well there's nothing here to eat.
You miss me?...
I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Oh it's you.
It's only Peter.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
And He did.
She told me the name.
And then I saw her.
And all I know is when I looked in her eyes I saw something...
So they sent me.
That's not it at all.
I may not have the right name but I was there.
I'm the guy.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
I'll take the little lady home.
He just got a call from ""Mr.
"" Something's gone wrong.
He's plenty hot.
What do you mean, odd?
Well, where are they?
This is for you to figure out.
You can have it your way or you can have it his way.
Just bring him to...
that place we been using.
in if you think you need him.
That's what we always kept you around for.
Why should he forget it?
It'll do.
and God help you from here on in.
I could've had class and been somebody.
I always had a bet down for you.
You saw some money.
You was my brother.
You should of looked out for me.
eight-seven eighty-eight.
I could have been better!
You do nothing and you say nothing.
You know the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over.
Anyway it gives us a chance to talk.
I needed to talk to you.
You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I thought they'd talk to him.
That was the idea.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
""In the church when you need me.
I'm in the church when you need me.
You're in this too Father.
everybody said it not only me.
Tell me who?
Am I on my feet...?
Every one of 'em...
Are you sure they're your friends?
Well it's over.
Thanks just the same.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Do what I told you.
Call the Father.
There's something I got to do.
I want to live with you.
Live with you.
I said stay away from me.
Get away from me.
I never mentioned the word before.
That  word again!
I know what you want me to do!
You've got to be one or the other.
I want you to believe me.
Told him what?
I just told the Father.
Yeah yeah it's up to me it's up to me he says it's up to me.
Much much more!
Look out for number one.
Always number one.
Okay get in hot water.
Why worry about me?
You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I thought I felt mean tonight.
For not being any help?
I got my whole life to drink.
All right all right..
Come on drink up.
I'll play you some music.
He was looking at everybody the same way.
Asking the same question.
I never met such a person.
Do it to him before he does it to you.
Now what are you doing?
You mean into the water?
How about another one?
It's quite  nice.
Now you're beginning to live.
Want to go out and have one with me?
How do you like that one?
The things that go on.
I go for this stuff.
There must be twenty thousand of 'em.
I feel real mean tonight.
I'd better go in.
Listen you want to see them?
He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Where you been the last four five years?
That's what makes people mean and difficult.
How would you've done it?
Now you got me!
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
The moment I saw you.
I can get home all right from here
I get your thought.
You know I seen you lots of times before.
Seven eight years ago?
Your hair come down in
It's how you use them.
I want to be a teacher.
I better get home.
What did that man mean when he said you were...
Everybody knew him.
He got around.
I better see you get there.
I'll get home all right now.
Which side are you with?
What makes him so special?
Let me by.
You are like
But now my eyes are open.
You better not let her down.
He wanted to see me again.
It's the same difference.
A look in his eyes!
Who is he!
Look what you're doing.
That's just what he wants.
Take your hands off me.
What you call me?
You go to
Mind your own business Father.
What do you want from me Father.
You got eyes.
I'm right in front of you.
Is that all you've got to say to me Father?
So you got a brother.
But you've got to listen to me.
So help me God!
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Or are you ready to go all the way?
Are you on the level Father?
Father one thing you got to understand.
Maybe you can help.
Who asked him here?
I'll walk along with you.
I'll never forget it.
I thought it was all over.
Such as what?
You sure looked it.
Something go wrong?
I think you could have.
You looking for me?
Never will be much too soon.
You'll work.
Some chance at ten percent a week!
You're his...
You think I should turn him in?
Looking for me?
She's a he.
Be sure they got enough water.
Boy you must've been up early.
I took care of 'em myself this morning.
You ought to go home and take care of that
Hit me again.
Keep the advice.
Give me a double.
Well I got to watch myself these days.
Here you want him?
You're mine!
From where you stand maybe.
But I'm standing over here now.
Go on go on...
You want to know something?
You want to know the trouble with you?
Now just a minute I
But this is business.
Hot off the press.
How'd you get that.
It was a big nothing!
The Father did all the talking.
Nothing happened he says.
It must have been once too often.
Nice easy work.
You come from Green Point?
Go back to Green Point.
They left me this  to remember them by.
How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
A big try.
Not that free.
It'll be worth it!
One of these days.
Maybe I will one of these days.
Oh You could do nothing!
If I could get my hands on you...
You love me then?
Put it on heavy.
We'll just have to watch our chance.
When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
What can we do against them?
I've got my hands free.
I should hope not.
Be careful oh please be careful.
Nothing is worth your life.
I am--It's our only chance.
We're not finished yet.
You've got a right to be.
--They'll see you.
I'm not sure myself.
They'll have a telephone.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
Something's making that music.
That's what I want to find out.
We have to get help.
then what's that music?
Silly there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Let's turn back!
I've been there before.
Let's turn back.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.
It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
I will watch!
You better hope there is.
Is there time?
You may take her now.
and so she did!
All in good time...
Oh if there is only time!
There is yet time.
Now are there others?
I state there is still time for yet another.
Yes yes yes I know all that.
Now I will talk...
and The Mummy.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
And what is this?
But they are not yet one of us.
Then I will see them.
You two know them all.
a decided change.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
They are live ones?
Live with it!
You need not worry...
Not just now anyway.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
What do you suppose for?
He wants us.
I might not even take 'em off first.
Yeah that's him.
About eight-thirty like only a few hours from now.
What's free about it?
Out there in the free world.
They changed the date.
Till it's not funny any more.
Tell me how do you do that?
I want to speak with you please.
Ask him his name.
Keep him out've trouble.
He tell you how they met?
I'd like to get him before he does something else makes it worse on himself.
I could live with that.
He said ""Okay.
It's all he's ever done.
Did he say about me?
He'd call every once in a while.
I'm getting ready to go out.
You can come in if you want sit down for a minute.
Go away or I'll call the police.
So we can speak.
Wait in the hall!
Yes around here.
You were his what his box?
You in there?
Come <i>on</i>.
They sure do.
You ever wear one of these?
Half for doing what?
So what's that mean?
You find out?
I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You know how I felt about her.
And she saw you?
Yeah and I better call my sister.
You might not have a choice.
Look there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.
See if he wants to talk about old times.
Go in the easy way.
Jesus look at that wall.
Now that's a really big house.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.
Forget about my sister.
How long were you with the girl?
How long you talk to her?
You tell your sister about it?
The girl still with you?
Outside of that.
Love is funny.
They'd been together ten years.
She just sat there looking right at me.
Sure looks that way.
You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
That's her place.
So call her up.
He's like Yeah?
How does he saw the woman in half?
He wanted to meet her.
You better come see this.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Just that she got away.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want nobody'll know you.
I want to talk to her again that's all.
You wanted to take her car.
One of 'em starts thinking what's that car doing there?
Do we need him?
I'd like to know who she is.
Jesus Christ what were you doing in there?
She's coming with us.
Where in the hell are we?
The Wall Street guy?
And you let them come up.
Call and tell you.
You can go wait out in the car you want to.
That's all I wanted to know.
What is it you wanted to tell me?
I want you to go there see if you can get the manager to i.
him as the other guy.
If he does you call me right away...
What-- we already talked to her.
That's a dead end.
I been trying to get a hold of you.
You'll have to ask him.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Is that what you would've done?
Yeah but I had enough reason to believe he did and I told you.
What'd you talk about?
You talked to him?
Yes but I want to hear you tell it.
Oh is that right?
Nice girl like you?
If you move if you look at her again you're dead.
I could walk out of here.
What do you want to bet?
Leave it where it is.
You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Why you think is today?
Yeah but I see you moved it up.
Wait I know him --okay?
We're a few minutes away.
Who was the friend?
I saw one of 'em outside.
So why take a chance--
Not until recently.
Someone down here?
You know how to use one a these?
You learn from doing.
That's how you do it.
You got two minutes that's all.
Soon as we leave here.
Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
I thought everything.
Only thing he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Who's sitting here?
What's the matter with right here?
I watch the man's back.
Yeah I got a problem.
I'm trying not to.
You getting serious on me now?
You think I will?
I want you to know something.
So she did help you?
You know I saw you on the street.
If we could call time and get together for a while.
Like if we could take a time-out...
Yeah but in a nice way.
That's not what you were about to say.
I came looking for you.
I would've said sure let's do it.
Well I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
Like you both know something.
""  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Well does it make sense to you?
It's not a game.
Something you play.
It's your game.
I've never played this before.
How far do we go with this?
I had one just like it -- well it was the same idea but I had to get rid of it.
I like your hair.
Is that how you think of yourself?
Well we got that out of the way.
I meant you just got here.
I can go to the bar.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
You think he might tell you where I am?
I used to work for him.
Maybe I should put him on the phone let you two work it out.
Think I could have them back?
That's my dad.
Get your hands up and turn around.
Well but if --
I never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick.
You'd probably tell me.
You're sure easy to talk to.
Yeah she was good.
We still talk though.
It was just a year give or take a few days.
that thing you know?
If I go back now I do a full thirty years no time off.
Can you imagine looking at that?
I know the difference.
I believe you would have.
How many was that?
You've probably heard of me.
It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
One I gave him yeah.
That's his given name?
I've never done that in my life.
In my bag in the car.
You could use it.
All this shit you got in here.
What is all this stuff anyway?
what's this can?
If I could have a little more room.
Why you're just a girl.
She said that to you?
I'd like you to go wait in the car.
Take her with you and put her in back.
Wait in the car.
I see better with them on.
We thought you were somebody else.
You know who they are?
Looks like tonight.
I hear six.
What if I told you where and when?
I were you I'd get up and run.
Five point two.
We'll go to my bank.
You want money?
We thought it might be her husband.
Jesus Christ what the hell are you doing here?
Who's upstairs?
How are you Richard?
You think you're better than that?
A lot better.
What's to think about?
The next time I walk into a bank.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Yeah fish live in the present.
They just do it.
No need to decide now.
Be like the fish.
Let whatever happens happen.
It's nice down there.
I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
It's a little late for me.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you someone knows how to ask for things the right way.
Twenty-two months three days two hours.
It's a big house.
Plus even it was true he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah could be.
Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
There were others.
For a time.
What's it mean ""No Hair""?
Look at it that way.
I know you'll find me.
Jesus I believe it.
You mean the wall street guy?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
So you still have a choice.
Or if you want to play it another way...
I remember you now.
No that's not what I'm thinking.
I was never out there.
It's all right with you I'll just hang in the car.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Hey shit come on.
I say I want this car man it's mine.
You go get yourself another one.
You're either in or you're not.
Right now son.
Can I do what?
That's what I'm here for tell you how.
Along with White Boy there.
Okay here comes Mr.
There's his drive right there.
Watch the road boy.
I like this Town Car.
Oh I'm here all right.
I'm very here.
It's a guy you know.
I'll just tell you it's someone big.
We got one of 'em.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.
So far he's worked on his boat every day.
Your dad taking good care of you?
You're not my type.
Yeah I bet you do.
I <i>was</i>...
He use to take me.
Got run over by a car.
In this house?
You like to sit down?
He's talking on the phone.
He knew what he was doing.
And then throw him in the can.
I imagine you would've though.
Tell her you think he's a nice guy.
I bet nothing.
You think that's possible?
What kind of guy is he?
Yeah she is.
No he looks a lot...
Tell you what you're a good girl you might get another one for Christmas.
You used to like it.
Can we change the subject?
He's about to.
Oh he's moved out?
It's a --
Okay on three:  One...
Let's go upstairs have a look at the man's bedroom.
All right now you and Mr.
That's right just me.
You here all by yourself?
Out for the evening?
The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Yeah as soon as we got back.
In case no one knows what he does.
I've heard a lot about you Mr.
Forget about her.
Tell me where the money's at.
Well I need that...
Better get your little black book out Richard.
We got some business to talk about.
But then I could be wrong...
Are they dead?
We have a problem here?
He's been like that all day.
What is it with Red?
I've never seen him this way.
Are you sure they're here?
That's your line for tonight ya know.
I wish she could forget him.
No I was.
He was that good?
I mean you can put your hands on him if you want to but then my hands will break yours.
We want to know what we can expect.
I'm talking about how you make them show!
How would I know.
That's me Sir.
Man I'd like to --
Comes in a big...
And I'm on yours.
That'll help.
What's between you and her is between you and her.
But here's what's between you and me.
I'm just doing what we've always done.
So you can call me if you need help.
You hear my okay?
They're all over us!
They're coming around for another pass.
Is that when you put the move on her?
She said I was so much like you.
I said No I'm not.
But you saw the better part of me the part of me that could be like you and changed me.
You made me who I am.
It's not like you're thinking.
How's this for a fact?
You left her.
How's that for a fact?
I'm saying now you do know.
I understand how it could happen.
I know why any guy would love her.
Say what you think.
Why be sorry?
That's what you feel it's better to come out with it.
Let's go get a drink.
If I tell her not to come and she comes...
Then why are you looking for her?
And I want you to meet her.
It's time I made mine.
You're talking about war and I know what war does to people.
There's another one!
Land of the free...
We got a saying here.
A-low-HA!
From the air?
Now that's all I have.
Do you think that's why we're meeting.
That might not have been such a good idea.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
He took me back to his house and I never left.
He told me about you.
That he had no other friend like you.
And that's why you've come.
So let's try this again.
""  It means ""I am an American.
Whether you make it or not.
Is that the good new Sir or --
Thank you Sir.
Every other Sunday.
Wait let me look at that...
You better come in here.
Sorry to trouble you.
Our doctor's gone too.
And your choice is your choice.
It's just that -- I thought you were dead.
The letter I wrote you they --
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through but I'm back.
It's been...
so different being so sure you were dead.
I've done a lot of talking.
I hit the water hard.
And it was so...
How did you?...
Do one thing for me before you go.
But I need you to know.
And I will come back.
I'll find a way.
And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you and every minute since then is real.
I had to tell you in person.
The real war.
And not just there but here.
There's one thing I have to say.
got some news today.
This is our moment.
God help them.
I've already got some in.
How would you like that?
The last one was six hundred years ago.
It's about time for another one.
Has it ever worked before?
That never changes.
I remember that book!
Do you believe in all of that?
What is the matter with you today?
Maybe I should go home and change.
What if I'm the only one?
Give him a break.
You know he wants to go.
It looks great.
How do you like my hair?
I told you about her.
You said you'd be back at twelve.
You always said you wanted to get out of town.
But let's have a girls night soon.
What's with you and Michael?
I'll call you Later.
I'm sure I'll remember the way.
It's all too much.
They're waiting.
The only one?
Oh it's not so bad.
I have two wonderful kids my own business.
It's not the place.
You should have left here years ago like I did.
We did for a long time.
You just have to remember...
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
You better watch out for her.
Page eightysix.
But I would do what I can...
Then hold me.
I'll never give up.
I went back to high school.
And I spent a lot of time with you.
I'll just set it right here.
And so old.
I thought you were...
for a while.
Was I dead?
I'll love you for twenty years.
I think we should get out of here.
You're really out of your mind!
You were never there for me or the children.
What do you mean you and my father decided?
Who the hell are you to plan my life?
I never had a choice.
Now sit down.
Let me got!
I was trying to save you.
What the hell did you do that for?
Forget it it'll never work.
That's all I wanted to hear.
But this is more than love.
Just wait till tomorrow when you see your birthday present.
Then you'll understand.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Does this mean you like me again?
If you took the trouble to write it then sure I'll take a look at it.
But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music.
I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr.
Just take a look at it.
He told me to forget it.
You told me to forget it.
My parents tell me to forget it.
That's real big of you.
What were You doing there?
What were you doing in that part of town?
How'd you know about that?
I wanted to talk to you and I have one last thing to take care of at school.
) What the hell has changed?
For two years I've done nothing but love you.
waiting for a big break...
And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens you'll go to college.
But what has to be different?
You can always get to me.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
I will be happy if I have you.
But what's the point?
This is very hard for me.
I'm doing this for both of us.
I really want you to be happy.
"" I'm thinking Did we break up?
I have to talk to you..
That's the great thing about love.
Girls must go through that stuff too.
Maybe my dad's right.
We better forget it.
Listen it's running real late.
Your love machine...
I probably meant it when I said it.
And you were right.
We should wait.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Last weekend you said...
I even wrote you into my will.
As in is was and always will be.
He's trying.
What's it like to be eighteen?
Are we talking on the phone?
Looking good out there.
Want me to drive you home later?
They'll learn to live with it.
I figure three years is long enough.
I can understand that..
How could you forget?
We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
About what we said on Tuesday.
It makes a lot of sense.
You look great today.
Get used to the word.
Come on let's have it.
You hate them anyway.
I'll think of a way to sell them.
I'm not used to that stuff.
Well today's Saturday and it's still not here.
And what do you mean your house?
I paid for it I'm still paying for it.
And nothing will ever change that.
to record how much we love each other.
And she would Like to say something.
What would that be sir?
But that's what I like about her.
She's not like all the other girls at school.
My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
I hate you.
If any of you gave him half a chance you'd find that out.
What's she doing with him?
My children make me happy.
I miss them so much.
The things that Last.
If you believe it darling then I believe.
The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
That's a day's work.
But if that's what you want maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I just went out with him once.
Just us girls.
He's free to see other girls if he wants.
He's very interesting.
It must run in the family.
And the figure.
I thought I knew everything about him.
One day you'll remember and write about it.
You should go but not with me.
But what about the other night?
I met her last summer.
Now listen this is the plan.
Five more weeks of school.
That was quite an evening.
Here's a new one.
No I just made that up.
Do you want to hear one?
Hey what's with you?
It's really old...
You know the world looks a lot better from up here.
What're you doing here anyway?
As a matter of fact he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Would you wear those things?
He'll win.
He'll never win.
Things will pick up.
This morning was good.
Listen Dad please.
That's your problems The more women think the more trouble they get into.
Then you sell.
But this better be good.
Just listen for a minute..
Yes but I was a boy.
And I still had hell to pay.
At my age?
The story of my life.
We'll make it we'll be fine.
Does everybody have to hear?
A new car.
He has no such thing!
When did it happen?
No just a friend of mine.
Just tell us.
We'll believe you.
I went for a drive.
Stay away from it.
That's a good girl...
You mentioned something this morning.
Yes he's fine too.
Well she is getting on but she's fine.
She called to find out how you are.
Would you get that dear?
It was great to see everybody again.
It was nobody.
Who was that man?
All the kids drink it.
I may as well enjoy myself.
Use it in the best of health.
You have such a pretty face.
Why are you always trying to cover it up?
My little baby.
You're home now.
Of course he'll love it.
This is so nice all of us being together again like this.
You know you two are wonderful parents.
They're bad for you.
She thinks she's so great.
Okay what do you want?
Let's do something together..
You're never happy to see me.
I'm just happy to see you.
You have to stop.
I know you are but you have to stop.
I'll go with you!
I miss my kids.
Tomorrow's my birthday!
I've got to get out of here now.
You were meant to.
It's all gone wrong nothing's working out.
I think it has something to do with your birthday.
Did you find out why I came back?
You started taking your clothes off.
I was putting them back on for you.
I'll be right out Dad.
Yes every day.
Maybe not the first time.
We were just too young.
What will they be made of?
We'll start with something easy.
I'll try anything.
That's what you were talking about yesterday?
Everybody does that in the future?
They never heard of them!
Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
Okay there's lots more.
Look it's very simple.
How come you never ask me any important questions?
What about people?
Money is power..
Richard take it easy.
I know what people think of me.
I'll show them.
I'm just not the type.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
All right I'll work on it I'll do some research.
I told you I've already lived my life.
I want to get back to my real life!
What it it's God?
There's your door.
There's one way to find out.
Am I dead or not?
Come on Richard I'm serious.
I'd be very careful if I were you.
But when did you leave?
Are you here until then?
Were you there until now?
Can anyone do it?
I read about it.
I know what you all think of me.
Nobody can know.
You can till it with whatever you want.
Do you think...
What did you want to talk about?
Make it fourthirty.
Can we meet after school?
I'm too busy.
And you have a beautiful wife.
I just did it for tonight.
You look exactly the same.
how is that possible?
The dog was dead.
You want some advice friend?
You get in your car you pick up your family...
and you get the hell out of that town.
with a cat...
Are you listening to this?
Just start things over you know?
I hear you moved into town.
Pretty much so.
Not this dog.
You sure did...
I did it when I was young.
What do they do up there?
I can bring her back.
it's a school night and if you do this again...
Where're you off to?
How was your first day at school?
I'll be fine Dad.
New town new school.
I know it must be pretty hard for you...
What's a lunch cost these days?
You want ten?
What's wrong?!
That's the new law.
You ever think about running away?
maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
He's different.
Maybe it takes a while...
You think he'd believe it if he did?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
You know he was.
It's getting pretty late.
We better go.
You never get over it.
I mean eventually...
You want me to help?
You said so yourself...
There's a better place...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
I miss him too...
He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...
How did it go with your father last night?
Anybody see my boy?
What's wrong with my face?
You want to know what's wrong with my face?
No more questions?
What's wrong with your face?
What in God's name...
Who thinks that sir?
I've certainly been busy.
What about next time?
Ready for what, baby?
I'm ready...
Do you think I'm ready for it?!
I hate this shit.
You want me to give up?
We're on the Positive Plan.
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
You think we're near the end.
That's not what I said.
Forget the fucking case one hour a day and give me a little of your time.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
Close the law book.
This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I have too much work to do.
I will be back.
That's the third time.
I better call the office.
He's not sorry okay fine.
Maybe by then we'll hear from my doctor and we'll go from there.
I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Your future that is...
More than your friend.
We're waiting...
Thanks for coming by.
A good start.
If it please the court I'd like to ask Mr.
What do you love about it?
I love the law.
I know the law.
It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
I still am.
I suppose you could say that.
What kind of person is that?
the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
I know it's not your area...
We have a big day on Monday.
Let me tell you something okay?
When you're brought up like the rest of us in a place like where I was brought up there's not a whole lot of discussion about...
No we have to do it.
Let's find you a drink.
How did they find out?
How's your baby?
Who'd you get?
I'm not dead yet.
I'm sorry about...
what's happened to you.
Thanks for your time.
I know I have a case.
They want you out.
What's that shit on your face?
We've lived together for nine years.
That's their story.
Want to hear mine?
Kids are great.
Little baby girl.
One week old.
Jesus Christ what happened to you?
Client of yours?
If it's late there's no case...
Answer the question please.
Do you need a break?
That happened once.
In my work?
"" Is that correct?
I hate when you put me on hold.
There's no way my client will go along with that.
But he was working so hard...
Still I felt something was wrong.
No more questions.
One time Mr.
Is that a question?
You're black.
But thanks for the information.
The guy sat in my office!
We were wrong.
I may have said something like that.
But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Do you remember saying that?
Were you pleased with his work?
Explain to me if you can Mr.
Am I getting this right?
we've got a committee meeting.
In a word yes.
You're in trouble.
do you think...
Would you like to have a drink with me?
Two men making love...
Now tell me again...
Am I walking different?!
Now I'm being totally honest with you.
""Is that mine?
Probably since she was born.
How many do you know?
No on this side...
or this side?
Take good care of Mrs.
Of course you have a case!
Do I have a case?
Yes we did.
But we took care of him.
Any women on board?
Anywhere from two weeks to several months.
Do you know what I'm saying?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
You had one guy ""like that?
But now we're standing up for ourselves...
He never put it in.
"" He said nothing.
He was doing a great job.
Did he say ""I'm sick.
I might not be able to see this through?
That's kind of...
Did he tell them?
Make sure everyone else does too...
Not sure where to go.
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Anyone not ready for this?
You came for us....
Go over it!
GO OVER IT!
And if we got any choice that's the way we should all go out.
With all those things still out there?
It was just somebody else.
He was just....
Okay it was me.
What'd I do now?
Tell me that was you.
Bring the light!
No we'd never....
Well is someone coming for us?
I would try for them.
they could still be....
Just give me your hand.
Make it easy on you.
I have to go and....
If you believe anything about me better be that.
Get on board.
Got a better idea.
Just come with me!
I only deal in life and death.
All that stuff in between?
What you're afraid?
Not until we go back for the others.
Tell me the settlement is right there!
I'll tell you where!
You sure you can keep --
How many you see?
That the big plan?
Get out of our way.
Think about what?
What the hell are you --
But I just wanted to say --
Just in case you know this actually --
Why what'd you hear?
Then where is he?
Maybe I did do a few people.
But not this one.
Heard about it.
Just never seen it.
Well we called him ""doctor.
You did this?
Show me your eyes.
Tell me about the sounds.
You told them you heard something right before....
And I'm not sure I can....
If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
He'll get us there.
whatever it takes.
So maybe we'll have enough light.
I know what's in here!
It's starting....
What do my eyes see?
Just shut up okay?
What's to be afraid of?
Are you fucking high again?
Just listen to --
My bad okay?
Stay in the light!
Stay in the fucking --
Is there anything at all?
What the hell's it matter?
We can stick to the plan.
Stop it stop it STOP IT!
I never said I was.
Let him go if that's what it --
You said there was a deal.
Maybe I can use him to help with --
What's the discussion?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
Where are they then?
And you're playing right into --
Let's just be sure.
He used that?
Just tell me what....
Thought I heard something.
You see anybody else here?
Just between you and me.
Better keep moving....
No no I wanted to get away.
Probably makes it worse.
Be my choice.
We should leave soon.
Anything to drink!
Maybe we'll never know.
Might take a few days to --
Now they train you for this so --
Company's not here is it?
So what we should both go down too?
Christ I was looking right at him when --
I would rather we all stay--
And you're certain you can find the way back?
They're afraid of our light.
One is all?
To know God better yes but to know yourself as well.
"" And a city man.
We'll have to wait.
Get the girl back under.
He will be with us.
Oh absolutely I believe in God.
we must keep her close then.
Has anyone seen the young one?
Listen to her?
That there would be...
The child heard you before any of us could even....
We got you...
it's okay it's okay...
we got you now....
I'm born-again.
""God is Great yes?
There is no water.
So just like that.
For all these.
then we saw this.
Like who, Mr.
What's one more to you?
What's her name, anyway?
What if you're one of five?
Not if I'm the one.
Six of us left.
A good thing, right?
Girl's not cut.
About the girl.
Hard to tell, sometimes...
even for me...
Okay by you?
Well, what's it look like now?
Said looks clear.
You said ""clear.
Would if I were you.
And there may be a way.
Well what's the need anyway?
If he's gone he's gone.
Why should he bother us?
You'll get picked up.
How did you know we'd come here?
Yes sir so it was -- thanks to you.
We thought you were....
Care to have a look?
I have to agree.
From all you've found so far his position's as good as yours.
Maybe I can pay you back.
Right now if you like.
No one really knows.
What would we find?
That's what  we'll try for.
Just the same I want one.
We'd better get started.
No thank you'.
Well maybe they're not.
It's probably wrong --
If it's true they'll have to accept it.
Where would it get you?
Now just a minute --
Where did you learn to do this?
Here comes Number One.
What's so special about him?
The one I was telling you about.
Do you have to work tonight?
Let's find them all.
Where there's one there's another.
If there's no life here we've got just seventy-two hours to find it.
But how long is a day?
We've enough food and water for three days.
What do you mean made it?
I suggest we go and look at them.
He can reason?
State your case Mr.
This is a man is he not?
Show this to the President.
Well you know what they say.
He's trying to form words.
The minute you open the door he goes into his act.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Try telling them our names.
I'd like to know why not.
he's not like me at all.
But he makes sense.
I understand why  he's here.
You read me well enough.
Oh and one last item.
I'm telling you --
Why did you come along at all?
We're here and it's now.
What would you learn?
I've told you where you are and when you are.
By our time.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
She's been dead nearly a year.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth.
It's no use...
there she goes.
It's the only way anything ever gets changed.
I must say I agree.
Yes I can do that.
I've been right all along.
You'll see it all later.
I'm for that.
Just let her out.
I want her.
She comes along too.
So you can talk.
That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.
Who put them up?
I told you not to bring the other one.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case.
Surely you must know why you're here.
I know it's a man.
And you want to do the same to me!
Let me tell my story...
You gave him that name yourself.
Stop right there.
Bring me that paper.
Read it yourself.
Not only can this man speak.
He can write.
He can reason.
By your leave Mr.
You may not like what you find.
A world turned wrong side up.
And you were right -- I have always known about man.
Tell him to pull back!
Twelve hundred years ago.
Where are your women?
Then how is it we speak the same language?
Speak to him.
With one of them.
All right but....
By all of you?
She's not sick at all.
You want her that much?
You did this to him!
You knew about this?
Second from the left.
I can talk!
I looks like he's talking.
Listen listen -- I can speak --
Let them talk Mr President.
Let them talk.
Like you I find it difficult.
I do not state it sir.
He saw you moving yours.
They got their shit together.
How the hell did he get away?
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no.
Get back to your position.
Like to speak to you.
Take a minute.
Come on you can do better than that!
Listen to that shit that's good shit!
You're wrong man!
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long.
See them go down?
I got one...
I'm sick of this shit man I'm sick of this shit!
Do you believe that stuff about...
Sometimes there's things in my head...
You really think so...
What happened today's just the beginning.
And you do you believe?
I love this place at night.
there's no right or wrong in them they're just there.
That was it!
But what'd she actually do?
But what'd she do?
After I get me some.
Okay my man...
Not just me...
it's the way the whole thing works.
Way out of anything man.
How many days you short?
Takes a man down...
there's nobody.
Must be somebody?
you know that night we got hit...
Here have some of this.
Sounds like it.
Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
You know what I'm talking about!
They're on their way...
Three years he been here.
Yeah you done said it.
Four years he been in the field...
- where that come from?
Till he was dead - and even THEN!
My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
That's his high baby.
High on WAR!
back on you.
You'll get new men any day.
Time being you make do like everybody else.
You wanted to see me sir?
Next time you try that Mr.
What's the matter baby?
How careful should I be?
Please be a little more careful how you talk Mr.
Why certainly baby.
If I change my mind.
You've been rather nice to me in a couple of ways.
They just go.
I'm sure you have.
He's a useful guy to have on your side.
I think you're a nice girl.
Lovely view too.
A very small service.
How long for?
I'll make one for you.
I live there.
How far does this train go?
You could tell me your name.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it Mr.
Same as an hour ago.
They might think I was running away from something.
Otherwise they might think...
How long would that take?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight Miss.
Good evening Miss.
Can I do something for you?
I think you mean that.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?
It's not so hard for me as you think.
The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.
And there's you.
Every day of your life you'll want me.
You'll never get over it.
Would I want to?
You could never tell about me.
Who'd believe it but you?
It must have been.
Nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since.
So that I will never be found.
And I have to use it.
It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Maybe I could believe it.
Should I try?
He'll come back...
They always come back when you give them money.
I paid him off.
I'm beginning to wonder about him too.
The money that makes you Mr.
They had names.
For the record.
So could you.
Funny I never thought of you that way.
You were so close too.
We were all pretty stupid about you.
If you're doing all this just for me.
I'm beginning to wonder.
Here put this on.
You leave it.
But not if you say so.
It did but it never paid off-- until now.
I ought to be back within an hour.
Help yourself to anything you want.
You can make coffee if you like.
If they had any reason to.
Why go to all that trouble?
Here's an open book.
No reason to keep it open.
She was a nice girl anyway.
Leave her stay where she is.
Close the book.
But that's what I'm doing.
Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.
And where to go.
And changed her name again.
Her stuff is all there.
Not if you are young and beautiful.
Do it all the time.
They'll look for you.
They'll find out about the other.
They might know already.
And when they get this--  What would they look for?
Out there somewhere?
They were all afraid--of my father-in-law.
My father-in-law will never give up.
And it happens all over again.
Almost the same thing.
Almost the same way.
Do you wonder about this--
How bad is the other thing?
I've never been very far from it for a long time.
Bad enough for--
After you're gone where would they look for you?
Why would they look for you?
Stop a minute please.
But it must be near the water.
I never saw him Before.
From you I like it.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.
No use waiting then.
Try not talking.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me.
Anything I can do about it?
There's nothing I can do about it.
Then he's--
He said no--he meant no.
That man over there.
I know everybody.
They know you here--know your name.
At this time of night.
It's not as bad as it looks.
Is this the best you can do?
I like it fine.
I was born and I am here.
Just who are you anyway?
Certainly not to me.
So there is.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Quarter after one.
There's one thing I may as well tell you.
You tried to run away.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
if you want to.
He was a great boy for that.
Nice of him.
On a train.
but somebody always does..
He got in here how?
That anyone would believe.
I came up and went to bed.
That's the first time I saw him out there.
There's one less tonight.
Much too late.
You're sure Mr.
but to the wrong man.
I can be talked out of it.
I never pay for anything.
You're not paying for this.
It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
As I said before...
not very well.
And I like his friends even less.
Lot of money...
It's open-house.
I was up there.
Sit down then.
We often have a double up here.
You can have the table yourself if you'd rather.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
You'd never have known.
But even if you were in love with me.
There is a difference.
However much he might happen hate it.
I saw you send those two men away.
I know they were watching me.
That's they're business.
What will they do to you?
You've got a couple of hours maybe.
If I do it's to save my face.
I'm off the case.
She told us this morning.
-- The ones that know you well?
--and like you very much?
What does he see?
He looks at the girl looks into her eyes--
Points very straight to her.
I'm about to be very silly.
I might be able to save you.
If I knew enough.
If I understand what you meant by that.
Nobody can help me.
A very nice one--but you have a job to do.
I'll find out you know.
Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow.
But in the end I'll find out.
I'd like to believe that.
It's not too easy.
You were there when I last saw him.
There are a lot of reasons.
You can see it.
You must come from pretty far South.
Where's you get it?
Stop saying you're sorry.
Well that's not getting us anywhere.
Please answer my question.
I'm sorry that's all there is.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
I was born in New York City.
And here I am.
You probably know the type.
They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes..
or particularly want to.
Have him call.
And there's a Mr.
Says his business is personal.
Why not here?
There's two hundred.
I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Get it in half an hour.
Got the information on you?
Got it on you?
Another client paid for that.
You mentioned information.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
For two hundred?
For five hundred what do I get?
Oh that girl you were with last night.
I'm a long way from home.
I got plenty of 'em.
Different names different jobs.
Go anywhere do anything.
Nice girl you were with last night.
Known her long?
I'm not sure I want anything from you.
You might want something from me.
I'm still asking.
You asked for it.
I'd like a few words with you in private.
Until he comes.
You've met him.
You two come together?
The new ones are fine.
Who told you my name?
What made you think that Mr.
You asked me where it all came from.
Where did it all come from?
I'm afraid they do.
Far too often.
Where would she go anyway.
No more for me thanks.
He knew where her room was.
You were out most of the evening.
After that act he put on up here is it likely she'd let him in?
That COULD BE TOLD.
The only answer I have for you.
I'd like to go on thinking so.
If you tried to help her get away--
How long since you saw her?
Wonderful thing money is.
Well--good night.
How are you two getting along?
I had some.
How would you like to take a walk for say half and hour?
How about a cup of coffee?
We do when we get the chance.
Near his right hand.
About a foot away.
I rather thought so.
I ought to know better.
Yes I've seen it before.
That's what I thought at first.
If I can get off.
It goes with this...
Want to walk out...
Just do it somewhere else.
This is my new girl friend.
Met her on the train.
What's the matter baby.
The rest of the party you can have.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Rather more than a little something Mr.
A little something on account perhaps?
He was very easy to hate.
You could have got in that room just as you got in here.
Good night my dear.
Everything points to her.
He saw my face too.
None of us ever saw him again.
They always have another.
See how easy it is?
It is rather late...
No Not recently.
He may come out of it and he may not.
And believe me I had it coming.
What you think is important--I think is important.
How important would it have to be?
We've done that.
I've got a year.
Or a second.
I'm not sure which.
They hit him too hard.
Find out about it.
Only just dead.
You get it's brother.
What do I get for it?
He might have left something for you.
What would it look like?
How do I know you're you?
Just like you thought...
You win all along the line.
And she did give him the chance the way it worked out.
He could have tried.
How did he know he'd get the chance?
If I leave it here....
You've got a dead man on your hands.
You can find out the first part.
The second part you have to take a chance on.
Do I know that she's out of the room?
Likely to be out of it for some time?
You can find out.
I go to a lot of trouble.
I'd want to know just about everything about them.
They'll probably believe you.
You'll tell them a simple story.
Should be over there.
let's try out the act.
Not too hard is it?
Market one-eight-four-two.
I'll know when I find it.
That stuff was all gone through last night.
I've always looked forward to it.
It was on a table in there.
It's her room.
I've met her.
A half-man?
Thank you very much Mrs.
I've felt it myself.
I was in love with him...
May you what?
Oh so I am.
You'll have to take my word for it.
She fit into this?
Three men and a women.
One is the bag type.
The other one had the money in it.
It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.
Not too far I hope.
You're a young man.
This is why I gave it to you.
I'm not one of them.
Well find out.
Where's the girl now?
You have an hour to make your mind up.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.
The only one who tried to run away.
But not the only one.
How do you do sir.
I say YES!
After all you got what you wanted.
A girl you meet on the train.
Be back in an hour.
I told you she's just..
How about your new friend?
How long have you had it?
Kind or not kind.
That's not very kind.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
Oh what's the use.
You're you.
For a long term.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You wanted it that way.
Why should I mind?
She's just a girl I met on the train.
How could I help it?
Oh many things.
They want to know what went wrong.
Well we were just...
Anyone for a walk?
You ought to have that...
I will thanks.
We'll see you next week and if--
She'll be here next weekend.
Actually we've only just met.
I think you'll do very well.
I was beginning to wonder who this Mr.
It's fine thank you.
It's not too cold for you Mr.
And that's why I'd like to be able to help you.
But really Mr.
It's kind of you to see me.
I am sorry to have kept you.
I'll suggest it.
Anyway I'll be back with this soon.
Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Give them here.
All local women at first then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Now first of all tell us your name.
Keep me company.
I'm not sure I can face it.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.
Coming to the meeting?
Not too bad thanks.
Have a good holiday?
James has got some news.
Who was the old one anyway?
And to history.
It's everything we wanted.
A very good read.
I think that's wrong.
I'd want to--
And some of that.
break away completely from--
I'll have some of that.
I'd like to break away--
Shall we have a drink or something?
In your car
Remember you're here to talk to my mother.
Look will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Well you should.
Did she talk about me?
I think we're ready now thank you.
Did you get on with my mother?
In radio we're different.
That's what comes of working in television.
I have to be up early.
Why not stay?
Yes if you like.
They're early.
That must be rather nice in a way.
What about yours.
I went round telling everyone how awful her books were.
That's what I think anyway.
You do everything right but you feel nothing either way.
And you're at this third stage
You're at the centre of the world.
As soon as anything happens you're the first to know about it.
Some people leave at this stage.
My real father?
What did your father do?
But I like my mother.
It was sort of...
I think it went on rather too long.
It was very good.
You're a piece of shit
It might have worked.
I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Are you up to something?
Still in love?
I'll ring you.
Let's meet.
Perhaps I will then.
Perhaps you should come too.
Got held up.
So I've been running round getting people to do things.
Far too long.
She's very nice apparently.
You'll have to watch yourself there.
She's never written a book in it but she clearly knew a lot.
There's more.
You're so hard.
You'll see when I'm ready.
It's shit.
Tell me what you think of this first.
James is in love.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Have you come to talk about me?
She's not my mother anyway.
Why not sit down and wait?
I'm waiting for your mother.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Yes if I see him I will.
Take a look at these.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I've got a meeting tonight.
I've got some in.
No thanks Dad.
Yes you said.
You take this up to her.
Tell her you made it.
She'll like that.
I'm sorry about Saturday Dad.
You know what she's like.
So how is she?
Come into the kitchen.
I'm just making your mother's tea.
No no let me go on before you get the wrong idea.
I'm just saying...
I'll tell you another thing.
We're the best it's as simple as that.
We've got the lot.
Well it's worth seeing.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.
There's one or two things I'd like to...
Will you let me have your number before you leave?
I was here last year doing a piece remember?
Working for television?
You're just a young thing.
We'll see what we can do.
I want to look like you.
It was last year.
And you're so beautiful.
Actually I've been once today already.
I'll stay here with him.
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
You never were...
Come on you want to do it.
Even for you.
Let me hear it before you check out.
Maybe you've heard of it.
I say when it's over!
Sure you can!
You may even like it...
That's what I like about you man!
He's on the road.
I could never make this thing work myself.
She was my woman once.
Nothing I can do unless I get there.
You call him...
and tell him to let her go.
let's see...
six hours from now.
Think it through!
I'm the only one knows where they are.
Just let me talk for a second.
You're a fucking dead man--
One thousand feet.
You do it...
I'll take that as a yes.
Here take mine.
Ever done this before?
good very good.
Here hold it.
Check out the weight.
News last night...
How you figure?
Always trying to win.
I know that part.
Tell me something I can use here.
Football's a man-made game.
Maybe you can make it.
You always talk like this?
The other two always hang.
So your life's not over yet right?
I missed my window.
There's nobody else here...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You mind if I go take a look?
Have you seen a little dog?
About this big.
Three men dead.
And yes you bother me.
Not so far.
This is us.
All the food groups?
You know less than nothing.
That's why I put you together in the first place.
I been on this case for two years.
I want you two to go work it.
They took a left at the next light!
The hell are they?!
Get me two.
Time for lunch.
We cover the bank whatever.
I say we call it in.
I'm right this time.
We can still win this one.
Summer's almost over.
I'm on him all day right.
should call first you know?
Hey where the hell were you all day?
Get into position.
Where you want me?
What about the brother?
But let's do it anyway.
Got their own language.
You've got to get out there.
Get into their head.
Ask a few questions.
same the year before.
That was thirty years ago anyway.
's changed a lot since then.
You through Mr.
The night's still young...
Yeah they control the room well.
I needed you at first but not--
So what'd the other guy look like?
did I do something?
Those are cold.
See it's gone.
I just want to sit out here for a minute.
and past it.
Maybe he has.
We went out for about five minutes...
That sounds personal.
Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
If you're a minute late I'm gone.
I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own.
That'll be four fifty.
I want to do what you do.
So I wanted something for myself.
See all my life I've done things for other people.
This is a line right?
Here follow me.
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment you can think...
Well I saw you and--
What the hell's wrong with you?
We'll be along.
You get these people and get the hell out of here.
We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
I can accept that it comes with the job.
what the hell did this?
Just like the others...
We take her and she'll give away our position every chance she gets.
The whole set up.
We take her with us.
That's right I set you up.
From the start...
Well somebody sent them.
I knew this man.
What the hell were they doing in here?
Mean anything to you?
let's go!!!
This gets better by the minute.
Who's our back-up on this?
I needed the best.
and here we are.
This must be good.
Take a position over there.
I'll work around towards you.
But I know one thing Major...
not at that range.
He was there...
Those fucking eyes...
The best friend I ever had.
It's never easy.
You saw what?
We found 'em both dead.
Another thing Major we were lucky...
Something big was about to happen here.
What's that General?
After that there's not much hope.
What have you got in mind General.
It's been a long time General.
Where the hell is his body?
What in God's name...?
Major you'd better take a look at this.
There's something else Major...
They never are dear.
You have a beautiful figure.
A little too out in the open but simply lovely.
Do what you have to do.
But I do know.
There's no way you could know that.
Twenty-five percent.
That's why people have lunch.
it's not like that.
Hope to be?
You two been together long?
You've won.
What's that long building over there?
You're very right.
I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
This time I imagine you would yes.
With all this in mind Mr.
If you had a...
For just a moment.
You're making the right decision sir.
I'll get used to it.
It's a public company.
I know all about you Mr.
What I have is a lot of money.
I do want to.
That's what you given me see?
I know what I want now.
I want a guy like you for real.
Stay with me tonight.
I'll take my money now please.
It felt good.
It was a business decision.
Not all men hit.
It's how I make money.
It's all just business to you.
Everything's business.
The man made a business decision.
business that's all.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.
I'm being stupid.
I'll think about it okay?
I want to get you off the street.
You'll have a different kind of life.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
I met this boy.
They stopped at a gas station.
He went to the john.
I'm paying you to be you.
Ever been in love with anyone?
You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
To meet some friends.
Where are you taking me!?
What if I lose it?
I really am sorry.
Well it's true.
Can we talk about this?
I want my fucking money.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
They're just into it for the money.
He's good at what he does.
He died a long time ago.
I went to public school.
My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.
One of the pieces was him.
And he took his money with him.
Dinner can wait.
What about dinner?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Come with me?
We're the exactly the same!
At your price I give my all...
And that's the way the game is played.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Go by yourself then.
Where you taking me anyway?
You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.
I hope it's appropriate.
Did you buy some clothes?
Never answer the phone.
Three thousand for five days.
All right two thousand.
But you want days too.
It'd cost you.
I'm in town until Saturday.
How much for the week?
Where'd you learn to do this?
Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.
I sell them.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
I buy companies.
Do you ever...
I had some work to do.
About last night...
I'll be out of here in a minute.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
It's a very good year.
They're both good at it.
I've known a lot of everybody.
And why do you say that?
In town on business?
Let's talk some more first.
Do you plan everything?
Want to know something?
Better believe it.
You know how to drive a stick?
you got it!
No but it's getting there.
For an hour.
For the whole night?
Company would cost you...
Day jobs yeah.
I've tried them.
So do day jobs.
What do you want it to be?
I bet you know it.
The price just went up to ten.
You looking' for some company?
Have you lost your mind?
Let him answer.
Give me twenty minutes.
I think we got him.
I had to call.
He wants to see you.
I'll be in the office tomorrow.
We're in too far.
So now they're best friends?
She met him at dinner last night...
I've known you a long time.
I see a difference in you this week.
What does she sell?
And you just happened to run into her.
What's she do?
The night I left your house I was lost.
Come on you can tell me.
Fill me in on this.
And some of it's mine.
It's my money.
Now you're giving him the chance to get away?
There's another forty million there.
Get on it right away.
No one you know.
Who's this girl you're taking?
I know a lot of nice girls.
Oh god what?
I'll see you in the office.
By the way about your car...
We'll make it social.
Love this car!
Is it new?
I just got off the phone with one.
This party's for you.
For food got it?
Here's some money.
Couple a hours.
And leave all this?
Not in a million.
What kind of school?
Get a job and probably go back to school.
You know he'll break your heart.
I might love this guy.
He wants to set me up in a place give me some money.
Oh my god you mean it was good?
Where do you fit?
Not that you ever did anyway.
Who did you think?
Was that you?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.
he just does.
Why'd he want you?
We can get out of this town.
We can do anything!
Hey you there?
Now come on --
We work for it.
We keep it.
No let's go to work.
I wonder how much she made tonight?
We worked for that money.
I come to turn down the bed.
Yeah well I check out today.
There's someone here to see you.
Then you would use your--
But I always eat like this.
You'll like it fine.
Will I like it?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Yeah mine too.
range shall we say.
They were real nice to me there.
I'm sure they're quite lovely.
And who is that?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I was in here yesterday.
Would you like to try it on?
You're obviously in the wrong place.
What is with you?
I asked how much it was.
You have beautiful things.
Are you looking for something in particular?
I'm just looking thanks.
Do you want to know what he did?
For no reason!
I just might do that.
You're a silly girl.
I suggest a deal.
Are we agreed?
And what am I?
I asked him what was so important for him.
He died well, that should please you.
He simply said, Please.
Please I need to live.
Does it bother you to hear?
This would be what five years ago?
He knows I do not love him.
And yes he will save me.
That I know.
I was giving you a chance.
No matter where you take me...
He can find you
Did you say ""I do""?
This old man said ""Man and wife.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say?
Now was that so terrible?
You can try it for tonight.
"" Three years he said that.
"" It was a fine time for me.
And then it happened.
There will never be a need.
you were dead.
I told you ""I would always come for you.
Can you move at all?
This is true love.
You think this happens every day?
But how can you be sure?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But what if something happens to you?
Fill these with water --  --please.
Why should that make such a difference?
Why is that do you think?
And a good thing too.
I just want you to feel you're doing well.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Oh good my way.
Which way is my way?
Finish him finish him.
Give her to me.
I'm waiting!
And he's got only himself.
I hope we win...
Right right sorry.
It fit so nice he said I could keep it.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Help me here.
I have a little.
Bring the body.
The Man in Black?
To find the Man in Black obviously.
Let's go --
If there are we'll all be dead.
Yes some of the time.
As you wish...
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
All right now let's see.
At the end somebody's got to do it.
You want me to read this or not?
Do you want me to go on with this?
Well who says life is fair?
Where is that written?
You read that wrong.
I'm just sure of it.
So now where were we here?
if you want.
But that's not the same thing.
Let me read.
-- well when does it get good?
-- wait just wait --
-hold it hold it-
It's very nice of you.
When I was your age television was called books.
And this is a special book.
It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick and I used to read it to your father.
Open it up.
I brought you a special present.
Let's get on with it
To the death.
It will not happen!
Very well I accept.
I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
The people are quite taken with her.
In that case --
-- Once I do how do I find you again?
Let me explain --  -- No there is too much.
Why am I on this wall?
I'll take you both together.
-- anything you want --
-- all that I have and more please --
Stop saying that!
Thank you for everything.
Give me the sixty-five I'm on the job.
But that's not what he said.
Now all dead...
well with all dead there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Look who knows so much.
Your first story was better.
Well I'll ask him.
You got money?
He is eh?
I must know.
I ought to be after twenty years.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
You are wonderful!
Whether I am or not you've been more than fair.
You are ready then?
It's been twenty years now.
I was eleven years old.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Nothing comes to mind.
I hate waiting.
But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I could do that.
Oh have it your way.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.
He's right on top of us.
Go in get after her!
It's only I just happened to look behind us and something is there.
Stop doing that.
I'll tell you in a minute.
Then make your choice.
-- there's nothing to explain.
Let me explain-
Bye-bye boys.
A good hour.
Yeah an hour.
He's afraid.
You never had it so good.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Let's hear him.
What have we got to lose?
Get on the phone.
I want to see everybody.
This is a very big decision.
It's enough to make you throw up!
Of course, I think we should add a little music.
That whole third act has got to go.
We'll have to put something in there.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.
""By the light by the light"
Well it's just that...
It's either the show or us.
There's no way out.
What are you doing with those books?
No way out.
Maybe it's not true!
it's nice and long...
I mean it's...
Only if we ask him.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Is he good...
I mean bad?
But if something should...
It would look better in court.
Take it when you can get it!
What will people say?
I want to see the money.
Okay take it off take it off.
in red and white!
Play along with him.
It's almost in the bag.
Who wrote it?
Run a week?
This play has got to close in the first act.
I'll tell you what's happening.
The mother of them all.
On top of the world.
Top of the world!
By God, I'll do it!
Say, you'll join me.
Nothing can stop us.
Maybe you're happy.
it's such a beautiful day.
Where would you like to eat?
It's only people I really like.
I got it, Mr.
That's very kind of you, Mr.
Come, let me take you to lunch.
Much, thank you.
Maybe I should eat something.
I think I'm coming out of it now.
I'm definitely coming out of it.
I'm way over here.
Sit over there.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
She was his wife.
I've got to get out of here.
I'm an honest man.
I meant no scheme.
Aha aha aha aha aha aha!!
But what if the play was a hit?
And how long did it run?
What did it get me?
Well it's very easy.
Yes it's quite possible.
What you were saying.
Now let's see if we add these figures we get...
You figure it out.
Oh it's all right...
look at me!
Why should they find out?
It makes a great deal of difference.
They come here.
They all come here.
How do they find me?
I can deal with it if I want to.
It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and...
It's nothing...
Well sir it seems...
Sir may I speak to you for a minute?
Good what is it?
Do the books!
Then account for yourself!
I'll wait in the hall...
Of course I need you.
Do you need us?
but it's still my child.
Plus to minus.
You mean out of business.
But he has long hair!
This is a man of his time.
Not good enough...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.
"" you know who?
We came here to talk to you about your play.
We make love?
Very nice girl.
Stop looking at me like that.
I must be getting old.
Of course the check I had it with me all the time.
I'll see you Thursday.
We'll do the rest on Thursday.
Watch the road...
Watch the road.
Oh the best one.
We'll play Thursday.
Oh this milk is so heavy.
Will someone help me?
Here I come ready or not.
you know who.
All for one and all in the light.
"" Listen this is not place to talk.
No not at all sir we're quite serious.
We want to produce your play.
How'd you know that you been up?
What do you do best?
Oh in show business.
I mean in show business.
we keep our money there!
They're all too big.
No good baby no good.
Hey baby that's good!
How'd we come out?
What did you tell the people?
Just for a moment.
Your mother met her?
Can I talk to your mother?
Not even by women!
Or if she had you say...
you'd know she was just using you.
If she paid you well?
Someone is sitting in that window.
Anyone at home?
people come and go...
I'm sorry I have work to do Mr...
And when she left she never came back.
How did she pay you?
And then she went to bed and left in the morning.
You said she was sitting ""back there or standing rather...
No one met her?
Of which morning?
Tell me all about her.
Or do you want to check the picture again?
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks.
Now try to remember if this girl...
Look at the picture.
No one has stopped here in weeks...
We have reason to believe she came this way...
might have stopped in this area...
Did she stop here?
It's a private matter...
you said you'd been to so many in two days...
What was it you wanted to ask?
Twelve in fact.
a hold-up...
Must've needed it.
I can take so much and then...
What's your interest?
Who are you friend?
No phone call...
Someone has seen her.
If you'll come along...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
I'd really rather not.
In the building...
I take it...
I mean out of state and all...
your car plus five hundred.
How much will it be with my car...?
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
I just want to make a change and start...
want some coffee?
I was just about...
Yes it's...
nothing wrong with it I'm just...
You can do anything you've a mind to...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
I have something...
so that's why he's late.
You better run out to the house.
She may be...
I called her sister Mr.
Call her sister!
Can see you do.
I still feel...
Did he say anything about my sister?
What difference does that...
Sorry I got you up boy.
I think something's wrong too Miss.
But not the same thing.
and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Go out there!
Find somebody ask some questions!
I keep thinking...
something's wrong.
I have to know what!
That's what I want you to do something about!
I think something's wrong out there!
And I want her to tell us the same thing!
or felt sorry for me...
and he was starting to feel the same about you.
I heard it when he called...
Unless he was stopped.
And he was stopped so he must have found out something!
say a year from now...
what would you need to get away to start a new business somewhere else?
Do you think if something happened it happened there?
Someone was at that window.
As man and wife.
she always tried to be proper.
Do you know how I found out about you?
I found one of your letters...
I wonder so many things about her now.
Why she never told me about you...
I got a job too.
Where'd you go to college?
Of course we will.
I've only been here five.
She's been here for a few days looking for her sister.
It's my problem too.
all the lights out...
I think he would have.
Maybe he went right on...
Where could he have gone?
And only the old lady at home...
Just wait here?
You'll never find it.
Probably on his way back right now.
Why call when we can go?
I feel better when you feel better.
Let's sit still and hang on okay?
It's been three.
He said an hour.
Then we'll come back here...
can I stay?
She'll need both of us.
You want me to stay here?
I'd better go home.
I just think...
I need to believe something.
How could I go away?
Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I ought to call the police right now!
I should've called the police.
The moment they told me...
Not that kind...
What thing could we be in together?
I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business.
I was getting to that!
A good reason I suppose.
And you thought she'd come up here to me?
She left work and home...
What should I know?
I want to know if my sister is here.
May I talk to you?
I'm late...
How can you even think a thing like that!
I'm thinking of it.
You know what I'd like?
Yeah but when you do...
I pay too.
I'm all for it!
otherwise though it's only hard work.
And under any conditions.
We can see each other we can even have dinner...
Not even just to see you to have lunch...
I can come down next week.
Or it will be...
And I'm a working man!
I'm a working girl.
This is the last time.
They say it...
It's Friday anyway...
What time will you...
I'd like to but...
try to pull myself out.
Before it's too late for me too.
And I'll have a long drive tomorrow.
to your room already?
Yes and just one time can be enough.
But I hate to even think such a thing.
She needs me...
it's just that...
You meant well?
I only felt...
Have you ever seen one of those places?
and my mother there?
It's too late for me.
who'd look after her?
what she's become.
No not like me.
I was only five...
anyway a few years ago...
Mother met a man.
We could have talked her into anything...
It was just too much for her when he died too...
And the way he died...
she had nothing left.
Oh I do...
I was born in mine.
People never run away from anything.
Why do you ask that?
What are you running away from?
Who needs friends.
A boy's best friend is his mother.
You go out...
It's not as expensive as you'd think.
I imagine so.
most of them...
You'd know, of course.
You're very...
I'd like to.
I was just about to myself...
There's no name for it...
You have something most girls never have.
I'll be in the office if you want anything...
Oh just the town will do.
I knew you must have.
Now wait just a moment!
Is there what?
I've told you there's nothing wrong...
something's wrong?
Then I'm free to go...?
You should have...
so I decided to pull over...
He's already been.
An old woman his mother.
That was early this evening.
No one was in the office and...
Went out before service.
And after he left?
Been just fine thanks.
Did you have a man stop out there tonight...
You must remember that bad business out there.
About ten years ago...
or do you already have it...
a lot of it...
Buy a new one!
In a new town!
I've been talking about your mother...
My mother is not dead!
And now that your mother's dead?
' It's my only world.
I was a happy child.
My mother and I...
we were more than happy.
I think if you saw a chance to get out from under...
What I meant was...
I'd do just about anything...
to get away.
Yet there you are doing all the listening!
Yes matter of fact.
so I thought I'd look you up and...
ninety percent business...
I'll take you to...
Looks like a bad day coming...
Just coming up to ring for you.
or my son!
You understand Boy?
You sure you saw an old woman?
Was that all?
like some people do.
He was out when I was there.
What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Everyone concerned thought...
if they could get her to give back the money...
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Did she talk?
Just before she died she came to--
How about me getting the help.
You can take care of her till I get help.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
I want to be the first to bring him the news.
I know he'll be pleased.
Indeed he has often told me.
It must be something important.
May I see him please?
Did you wish to see someone?
Why yes to you Mr.
You--a friend to me?
I only want to find out who you are and where you live.
Not taking their money.
Maybe you want my money too.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
They even brought a dog back to life once.
He has a cat of his own.
You're not as quick as I thought.
You get it quick.
It's my own idea.
I'm in the business.
What kind of a place is this?
Take me down there.
I had a little trouble with him.
He's in the hospital.
I'd like to have a look.
Mind if I look around?
Oh yes he's in good hands now.
So--that's it.
He's left.
Oh so you feel that way too.
Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
It seems to me she has the right idea--.
[Something very important.
We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities.
Then we will both be free.
But before I can get him back here you will have to help me.
That was your idea!
You were to help me.
It's here!
There's no child here.
Yes the child...
- That's enough!
- Give it to me!
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Come on with the rest of it.
Yeah but they leave you plenty.
Give me a chance baby.
I'll eat the first child I see.
There's no first act.
I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
But what about lunch?
I met one last night...
That's the way I feel about it.
So that's the way it is?
Well that's just how stupid I am.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does but--
Well I do say it.
What's nice about her?
She's the best friend I've got.
Why certainly sir.
Why what do you mean dear?
You will always be beautiful.
Think my child in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
You must not be afraid.
It is no trouble at all my child.
Oh please Mr.
Oh you children you happy children.
And that is as it should be.
My boy I think you are right.
I think we'll close for the night.
But I think these things are beautiful.
At any time.
I'd love to at any time.
Before this terrible thing happened to me...
And my child you are that figure come to life.
Hey what do you think you're doing?
Put that stuff back!
But I can go any place you can.
It happens that I'm the law.
Whatever you are you're the only one of it.
What do you think I am?
Get down there yourself and give a look.
Are you giving me this straight?
I'm for you!
Come down to earth.
I know all about that.
Does this mean anything to you?
Where do we go from there?
What's your idea?
I am right!
I know I'm right!
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong.
Which one is me?
we'll get it tomorrow.
Well that's got nothing to do with this case.
I hope they give him the works.
He's front page.
I would hang him!
That is none of our business.
All right what about it?
We get out a paper just the same.
Did you ever stop to think of that?
This is New Year's!
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line.
Where did you get the news item?
Well maybe it was.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot.
About three months ago.
Not so very far--
You know such things have happened.
That's not news.
I heard about it last year.
I've got a story for you.
I'm people which the old year saw out.
You people seeing the old year out?
How's every little thing?
All I have to do is get a story.
Here goes nothing.
What do you mean police dog?
Better cut that out.
I wanted to do it without saying anything.
I think he's worth it.
Have you told him about it?
It might help him a whole lot.
But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
How much money have you got?
You think I'm just talking.
I've only known you twenty-four hours but I'm in love with you.
I told you what to do.
I'll see it through.
All right brother.
Now look I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
Not even then.
I've had enough trouble over this matter.
Hold on hold on.
You're working with the police!
You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me!
You're trying...
Well let's get back to the case in hand.
Was that all she said?
She said she wanted to be friends.
Do you remember what she said?
She seemed happy.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Now let's get down to cases.
Yes sure that's fine.
You understand that!
She -- tried before --
Good night sir.
Well what do you think I'm in this for?
I'm not asking you anything.
you are asking?
Yes there's our way out.
A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
Now look here I've an idea that will get us out of all this.
Something important has got to come of it!
Something important may come of all this.
I came back for some of the books.
It is kind of you to be present.
All right I'll tell them.
They're right here in front.
you will be gone for good.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
They will have to wait.
But I have some friends waiting.
To lunch you say.
Everything my friend.
What is wrong with it?
This is the most important thing in my life.
I'd know him anywhere.
You have done well and now I too have something for you.
Well any time I can do anything for you --
There's no case against me.
Well I'll be seeing you.
The one I met.
What did your life mean?
Who did you love?
You did miss --
So I can move on.
Then you get it.
You'll understand.
That's what it asked me.
""What do you want?
What did it want?
Why am I doing this?
A place you've never been.
I could go out of town.
Could we go somewhere?
Day or night?
NOW you go home.
Be a nice boy and go home.
And I'm sorry but Mr.
Well I got to see her.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
It's for your health.
Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
What was your mother like?
Well I like him.
Yeah I'd believe it.
Here comes Daddy.
I knew you did knew it all the time...
No I'm all right.
Oh God oh Lord.
I'm thirteen.
Well now that is just too bad!
You know what happened has just made me love him all the more.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
That was very interesting.
All right that's enough.
I like you a lot.
Just for a second.
Actually I am though.
I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
As a child I never had no room all to myself we were awful poor.
I just feel awful.
Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man I'll say that.
Was that what they tried to do?
In what sense were they bad?
They were just bad men that's all.
But who were they?
Well now that's a nice name I like it.
I am real pleased to meet you.
All right what do you know?
I do too!
I think I hear a car.
She's got somebody in there Brother!
Look at it Brother there is no question about it.
But look this Brother it is even more interesting.
Look at this mark here and that mark over there.
But how would you find him?
See that son?
Someone has been walking here.
He's not coming back again.
What do you think Brother?
Yeah he's still up there.
Is that Doctor still up there Brother.
I never saw anything like it.
Well a little.
You were up late last night Brother.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother.
It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Oh yes it's Thursday.
my you're...
I think she's coming down the hall now.
What'd you say Brother?
Yes I did mother.
What did you say Brother?
This is for your own good.
I looked and its not in your room.
Now what were you doing?
She's very pretty she has a real good figure.
What's she like Brother?
The new girl is here.
Why is it taking so long?
Well if she's got any sense at all she'll listen to that.
""do it"" with all those boys and men?
Where can she go?
what's happening now?
What are they doing what's happening?
There goes Mother.
She's watching the car again?
She found her.
That's a hell of a thing to say.
It's true son.
She was fifty-six son.
But it was very quick son.
She was young!
I am afraid so son.
No son she is dead.
All right Daddy.
I'm older than hell boy.
Not for long boy.
A wonderful woman boy.
Where have the years gone Daddy?
Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
Yeah I know he was up here.
No it's another thing.
Is her husband sick or something?
Oh no no she got all over that.
Let's sit down son.
Oh I heard from her I got a letter from her she's fine.
Did you hear from her?
How could that be son?
In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Got another twenty years in it boy.
Good God the way you live here.
Yes we know her.
I think we both know her.
First about the girl's history.
That's all I want to know.
Well yes she's happy.
Well thank God we are rid of her at last.
And the best thing of all is that she's happy.
It's twenty after one.
Well I know more so.
That's why I was thinking...
maybe she'd be better off.
I thought I knew you.
I thought I knew you better I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
I'd say about three months.
What did you forget?
But she must know...
That's why I'm asking her who the father is.
Who's the father dear?
And you would be too if you had no job and no place to go.
Is there no way to get rid of this girl?
Just a moment dear.
Come with me Brother.
She's like a different person.
I hope she'll be all right but I still think we ought to fire her.
He's a brilliant doctor.
They ought to hang him.
I'll talk to her I'll reason with her.
Well I have a pretty good idea.
Why do you think those boys and men like her?
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.
But maybe you're right.
Well that's very reasonable.
Just a moment!
Yes I say that to you they were boys!
You say to me boys?
You certainly are!
Quarter of twelve.
Be kind to her.
But that's a wonderful quality not a bad quality.
Just half-a-cup of coffee.
You're not having lunch?
We forget he's just a child.
I wish you'd speak to him.
She looks pretty.
She's never had a real home.
Hope for the best?
She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children.
Yes it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
What was it Mr.
I hate to be mean but...
Well we know you were there.
It's so Mr.
What baby are you speaking about?
No no not exactly.
Well I have got news!
Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee dear?
He's a nice boy you'd like him.
Well it was a silly question.
That's all you've got to say you've got a bad cold?
I got an awful bad cold.
Well I know it I just got the bill for it.
And how do you feel today?
I'll just say one more thing.
It'll do just fine.
Bye-bye see you later.
What have you got in your hair girl?
There are more on the other side.
Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Got yourself up?
I got myself up, that's all.
Well, good night.
Do you know what a friend you have got there?
I'm sorry, Mr.
All right, all right.
Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
What are you doing, girl?
How did we ever get by without you?
Oh, to hell with it, never mind.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
You might see her.
I wish you'd tell her something...
I never could write letters.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Give my best to your Daddy.
Yeah, I remember it.
She used to call me Mr.
Right, but she did it.
She found him.
Well, so did I.
Why do you say I'm full of shit?
That's correct -- outside it, not in it.
It's a fact, I can build anything...
She has other things to do, Dave.
Hey, you, give us another drink!
He does it for me.
Imagine it, a book.
And I used to know you personal way back when.
How about that.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.
Well, that's interesting, Dave.
Of course, Dave, how are you?
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
Yes, dear, what is it?
And you get this in your head.
Do you follow me?
Yes, go on.
Oh, good evening, Doctor.
She's almost all well now.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Well, her people were very poor.
Afraid of the hospital?
She's afraid of the hospital.
She looks terrible, just awful.
But you'd better call Mr.
Yes, and it's very bad.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
You will find him a very good boy.
And as you can see he's beautiful.
You can stop it right now.
And who do you suppose he is?
He is Mr.
I have met Mr.
maybe it was...
I think maybe I'm sick.
There never was nobody like you.
Really, you do.
It'll get better now.
Never again, never again...
one of 'em...
I had better call Daddy.
You look sick if you ask me.
Well, you run on now.
I like to work.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually.
you made your point.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
what makes you think you can order me around?!
Let him decide.
Now you know what to watch for...
That's what I got.
Okay man okay.
You get nothing and like it.
what can I do?
And look at the that.
Time's running out.
I think it's all you've got.
You think it's that good?
It's up here...
Start talking or we're out the door.
It's not three houses it's twelve.
I need the ""when"" and the ""where.
put me down...
just like that.
Is that a fact...
We've been looking for you.
How you doing back there?
Same day as before.
How do you think it got its name?
When you planning to cut back on that?
That's sick.
pull over and let me out.
Okay we got...
You of all people...
What do I do if I'm not that?
You're just saying nothing!
Tonight is the night.
Let's talk about it.
I can work this.
I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Just a little you know...
What am I supposed to read it while I drive?
it's too early in the morning for this.
Here's your paper.
It's the way you say it like there's something more too it.
She's really something special.
Tell me something...
There probably is.
Live how you want.
What can I say to that...
I'm waiting till the time's right.
Well I got something..
We're police.
But what changed our mind?
That's him alright.
No but it should.
What's mine say?
Well I would like to sit in front today.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
We used to be friends.
You used to know how the game was played.
you'll enjoy this...
Are you even listening?
Hey now look!
Let's all get on the same page here.
He went to pick up lunch.
I think I can...
You'll never win!
You know as soon as I'm gone...
It's our job.
What will it be?
Just wanted to make you aware...
What can we do for you officers?
I'm well aware of that.
now that we know you know the hard part's done for us.
you're not doing what I think you're doing...
Who is that...
Maybe it's enough.
But that's all we got.
How'd we do?
Just got here.
Been waiting long?
Find out who ""A.
You get him?
All for one...
Let's get this thing done.
all we've got is each other.
Not you too?
That's right white bread.
You think this is so easy?
Let's hope.
""Go go go!
""  Make up your mind.
We got him.
you could say thank you.
Let me see that...
Here's yours...
Well let me tell you how it is...
the more you got the more you got to lose.
It's one of a kind.
Told you they'd do it!
and we might just take a few of them with us.
We've got to give him more time.
We saw it.
But I have no sister.
You were our only hope.
But I had to help my friends.
but that experience was part of your training.
I tried to stop him once.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side.
He is more machine now than man.
There's still good in him.
So what I have told you was true...
from a certain point of view.
about a great many things.
Your work here is finished my friend.
There it will stay until called for.
And when he does you must bring him before me.
Will you take it easy?
Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.
I thought she was with you.
to an old friend.
I've taken care of everything.
I used to live here you know.
I think my eyes are getting better.
The same as always.
It'll take time.
This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Shall we try and go around?
That's all any of us can see.
You know I know what she means to you.
I'll take good care of her.
I want you to take her.
You need all the help you can get.
A little higher!
Just a little higher!
Hello I think...
But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
What are you telling them?
All right hang on.
I need more men.
I'm already on my way out.
there is good in him.
I've felt it.
I can save him.
I can turn him back to the good side.
I have to try.
You've always been strong.
I wish I could go with you.
Then you know why I have to face him.
You have that power too.
In time you'll learn to use it as I have.
My father has it...
I have it...
my sister has it.
I never knew her.
She was very beautiful.
She died when I was very young.
do you remember your mother?
Your real mother?
Two more of them!
It is the only way you can save your friends.
I feel the good in you...
It is too late for me son.
Let go of your hate.
I will not turn...
I know father.
Told you did he?
Your father he is.
Already know you that which you need.
But I need your help.
but not that strong!
That is the way of things...
Yes or no will do.
He might be.
I thought it was the real thing.
Do you want her to see you like this?
Why do you think I should?
How about you.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
I hope so my darling.
Yes it's alright.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Oh I hope so my darling.
I'm here there's nothing to worry about.
Well I want to leave.
It's just a..
They may have a telephone.
Let's go back.
Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
But where will you go?
Life's pretty cheap to that type.
What with the weather and all.
I've got something to say.
I most certainly do.
He happens to be an old friend of mine.
You know this earth - this person.
Do you have a phone we might use?
Yes well perhaps it was for the best.
A decision had to be made.
You did right.
What a guy
Well I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Like this - like how?
Do you want him to see you like this?
Free to try and find a game
Oh my my
Want to come again and stay
Was all I had to say
On the day I went away.
Oh no no no no.
My high is low.
Oh lucky him.
Are you - giving a party?
What's to say?
' -- What ya got in the bag?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I always knew you was pretty.
It's not that --
I'll call your brother.
Do you have a phone?
I sold them to you.
And you never got the chance?
To you to me it's Thursday.
-- Nice dog -- Well I'll see ya later.
You gave me what?!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
It's not your house --
Do enjoy life.
Like it would make a difference if you were right?
Look at me I'm not ready for this.
One more round.
Get that doctor.
He got lucky.
It's very American.
Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Where're you off to now?
Here -- Three minutes.
I feel sorry for --
Am I seeing right?
Ya still light seventy.
You have my food in ya hand.
What about for food an' stuff?
A hundred an' thirty.
What's ya name again?
Not the face!!
Sure you do what ya want.
Ya like to put it on the street make it work for ya?
Ya got any action on the side.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life let him make it.
How'd you do last night?
He only had a hundred an' thirty.
-- I think he's good for the rest next week Mr.
No -- Just me.
I like 'em.
Stuff it man!
Can ya see?
That guy's great.
The guy's great.
I've seen it all!
Ya got heart.
Really think so?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
I done it all.
I've done an' seen everything'.
But who got the Press?
Real good boys.
I seen the light.
I figure somebody was home.
I said that before.
When was they here?
Here's the card?
Did ya win?
Twenty-five thirty -- What's the difference?
More like thirty.
How old are ya?
Okay go to work...
Open my eyes -- Please open my eyes!
You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life man!
Yo what's with you?
-- It was suppose to be private.
To see ya train.
Sure I like her.
Ya really like her?
Keep this job ya eat better.
I'll do okay.
What's ya sister like to do?
Maybe I better forget it.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job...
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I'd like to talk some business.
I'm thirty myself.
She looks at me.
You could do better than my sister.
Yeah he's great.
Do you feel you have a chance?
We can cut that out later.
People talk to me more.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Well I'll be...
Somebody took it from him.
That's what this whole thing's about.
So where is it then?
And another thing the paper said no will was found.
I know the guy.
They got him cold.
That'll work out just fine.
What've I got to lose?
He says he can help you.
Yeah do that.
Will you hold still?
So you decided to help him after all?
Anybody in the back room?
Is this paper even good?
You'll have it in the morning.
I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
People will drive Mr.
That's what this is all about?
It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Put him in my car.
Boys show Mr.
Indeed we are.
They must've taken it off me.
He had a will all right.
What were you looking for Mr.
Yes we talked to Mr.
He's not my client.
It's hard to talk.
Boy I'll say.
Here's one for the books...
That's why he brought me his will.
He's right here in the...
We're even.
By the way I did find your husband.
We better get out of here.
I love my husband.
Yeah I'll bet you would.
You've got the wrong idea about me.
I'll pay you anything.
I just had to see you.
Maybe that's what he was after?
There's no time to take it easy!
If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Have you got the will?
Thought you might be interested.
When will I hear from you?
So's the job.
Here's the problem...
Yeah and there's no business as expensive.
Only there's no business like it no business I know.
From this box here...
Only time will tell.
Think you'll keep it?
She's a good lady.
Hey it's the will.
but maybe you better let me take over.
I rest my case.
I tell you what maybe I better come with you.
Get away from there.
Nobody ever saw him again.
Yeah everybody thought so.
But when we looked into it we found out he did do it after all.
We went to his house to take him in.
You make me sick!
What is this Twenty Questions?
I think you want a drink.
well you just might get your wish.
Only when it was funny.
Yeah that's better.
Does this help?
We always run.
Then how'd you find my house?
If you do sir I am for you.
Ah ha ha.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Came he not home to-night?
And she's fair I love.
I will go along; An if you leave me so you do me wrong.
Good heart at what?
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate but more with love.
Not having that which having makes them short.
Is the day so young?
Then be not poor but break it and take this.
Is my Father well?
Be gone by break of day!
Where is my Lady's lord?
God knows when we shall meet again.
Need you my help?
Here comes your father tell him so yourself.
She'll not come down tonight.
Are you so hot?
Where is my mother!
what a head have I!
But all this did I know before.
what of that?
Is the news good or bad?
answer to that;
What is your will?
What's here?
Then window let day in and let life out.
It is It is!
Let me be taken let me be put to death.
I have more care to stay then will to go.
Let us talk it is not day.
Therefore stay yet.
It is not yet near day.
By the hour of nine.
A thousand times good night!
If my heart's dear love--
What's in a name?
Did my heart love till now?
A man young lady!
I thought all for the best.
I will follow you.
Well what was yours?
And so did I.
Why may one ask?
I am for you.
OH and but one word with one of us?
Couple it with something.
Make it a word and a...
Follow me close.
A word with one of you?
Death the end of all
To make a point.
All these years I've known you you could never wait for anything.
I'm up for that...
So where do you go from here?
Only the stupid ones.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.
Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
We kept it...
Some places not all.
Food's not our thing you see.
Is the rest of Europe like this?
How do we know that?
The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
They're good!
You lose them!
They're part of the team.
One of them's the guy I told you about.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Not to me you know that.
When we're done with this I want to do for that one myself.
Bloody fucking hell...
Where do you get off saying word one?
Then the wall goes down.
No more Cold War.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using it was in his contract.
But I do know who we're working for.
I better be getting that.
And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
To most of the men I with I was always the girl.
""Send the girl to do it.
""  ""Tell The girl to take care of it.
I probably do.
That fucking figures...
There's a problem...
Where's the case?
Ready when you are...
Now then let's run through it one more time shall we?
What's your job?
What do you do and what should we call you?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Do you have the money with you?
We'll double your price.
Where's my information?
I take it you still want the money...
Here's yours.
He's company.
Whatever you wish...
But you hate each other!
It is I'm telling you it is!!
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It has to...
A post office box.
Sent it where?
For all we know we're working for different people.
What you should do is wait for my next phone call.
When I'm ready I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
I do I do...
There is one other thing...
A means to an end is that it?
But close enough eh?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.
You seem one to me.
But I've never seen anyone like you.
So what is it you want to know?
So this is what a test?
It gets done now or not at all.
But first you have something to take care of?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Enough to move on for now.
Alright let's do it.
Did he bring that with him?
Fine with fucking me we got work to do.
My way is better.
My way works too.
Your man might live.
Gets the job done.
There's a chance for one of us...
Not in mine.
You should watch what you eat.
What're you talking about man?
Tell me something first.
Finish the job...
Let's get him out of here...
I'll work on it...
You have to stop doing that!
Do you have a good answer?
And when you finish?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.
Would you stop with that...
Not just like that...
They might see it.
Do we need anything else?
So I do it.
This is my job I have to do it.
I'm not here very much.
How could you have done that?
I would have tried not to.
You would have done that?
I was waiting to see what would happen.
You were behind the door?
It is at that.
It's a cover then.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
If Tony says this is it then it's it.
You sure your friend got the right place?
Just in case we need to find them.
Alright it's done.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
And what job is that?
Why are we even doing this?
There's no need to run Christ...
I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You know one around here?
You see it your way I'll see it mine.
Otherwise he'd be out of the country by now.
Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
He could go off road at any number of places.
You just learn to live with it.
How do you get used to it?
A lot of people died.
It was at that.
Please help yourself.
It was on the table.
And that's the guy you have to watch out for.
I needed to know.
I just wanted to see something.
They certainly are.
I wanted to see who you were.
Why bring me?
So is the woman.
Why not bring them?
As in one?
Similar but not the same.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
What'd you say to him?
Something like that...
As in they own it?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
To see a man about a thing.
This is my country you know.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Perhaps the police?
Who else would you be?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Tony and I have to talk some business first.
Can you get it?
What I've heard so far it's all a lot of talk.
Do you have the tape?
My man how you doing?
Not another word out of you!
None of them had any --
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!
What the hell happened here?
That'll bring me down too.
That's not US.
Just one more.
It's about
We're home free!
It's NOT too late!
It's too late...
No car phone.
We can make still make it work.
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here right now!
We've got to go now then.
We can do it spend it on the move.
We're not?
How do you figure that?
It was all used.
Do you have everything?
Yes I DO!
what are we doing?...
Like hell it is.
now what about the others?
Shit give me a break!
Well what are we supposed to do?
If you're any friend at all you'll stop talking like that!
Well I mean it this time.
Let's get this over with!
You said that last time!
What was I talking to the wall?
And how do you figure we do that?
Or get rid of the money.
Just call it the cost of doing business.
Well I'm not!
He would have done it to us right?
You know what they'd do.
That's how they all work it!
Man take it easy!
It's the stupid thing to do that's what it is.
It's the right thing to do.
He died on his own.
An officer of the law just like us.
We're dead.
We're dead We are dead...
Fair enough I'll take it to my place.
He saw everything!
I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
All right we will.
All right hold on!
What they were doing was wrong!
Suppose someone knows about the money?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again Jesus!
Let's take it and get out of here!
You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Shit more than that.
Ten thousand right here.
I probably would have.
Oh you would have done great.
Do you think I saw any of that?
I knew you'd come through.
Sure thing and --
You saw to that!
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
None of us like it!
Well I'd say it's a fair one like I said we're friends.
For both of you.
My point well...
It's odd.
and my personal thanks.
The last we heard from him was two days ago.
I want to tell you everything.
We'll meet new people.
You might have friends out there you never met.
We can have a new home.
What are you giving up?
I'm not sure why.
It's just I've never been anywhere else...
Why does that bother you?
It'll be more than enough.
We can get out of here...
A couple of weeks maybe.
I'll be there for you.
That's what has to happen first.
I hate it when you talk like this.
Let's just get out of here get out of this -- place.
I used to think he was something once...
he's next to you.
You know I always say to myself you should have left him years ago.
done anything in over a year.
How the hell did he find it?
I'll just be a little more careful next time.
And I'd take it out on him.
Let's not get into this again.
If you said something he'd take it out on me.
Remember what happened the last time?
He's not he's...
Like hell it's over.
You got me something?
You coming by tonight?
It was all over the local news.
Heard you had quite a night.
I might have to look into that...
But he would probably.
Ah hell he'd do the same for me.
A week ago at most.
A month a week...
Could it have been this?
We get a lot of people in here.
What did he buy?
Yeah I've seen him.
How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
I have a better plan.
You want to hear it?
Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Now where the hell is it?
Test the product?
What do you think about all this?
Jesus seven dead.
this is good.
Now we know someone's out there.
Have you known this all along?
Maybe I should come along.
Why would someone do that?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.
I thought maybe it would help.
I'll go down with you.
I told him I'd be there before five.
That's news to me.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
So there was money there!
Who the hell's money is it?!
Even had an officer just like you.
A lot of men come in here?
I'm just not very good...
with all of this stuff.
do you know her cup size?
Have I seen her?
She comes up to about here on me.
Anything I can help you with?
Well I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Nice of you to join us.
see you at three.
I'll do my best...
So be here at three.
She's not his type.
You'd do this to me!
You'd do this to me?!
It certainly is...
And do it all over again tomorrow!
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well you might as well say it.
Nothing really happened.
You can have it all.
Just have to...
I think I am.
You're never getting that much.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well you're not getting either.
Meet me there now.
We're out of here.
Then what the hell are you all about?
Hey we're all friends right?
Ah hell I'll get one soon enough.
This whole place?
Well what do you know!
Did they ever find out who they were?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.
Not getting an answer?
I'm not getting an answer.
I knew it I knew it all along - shit!
What's your take on these local boys?
Any news on that?
So someone did get away.
That fire was set.
what's the good news?
Yeah we did.
Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
There was more than that.
I would say maybe twenty thousand.
You want to hear the good news first or the bad news?
Did I say dinner?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Two-hundred thousand!
We already been there.
So tell me what you know.
How come you always save me for last James?
Is this about the funny money?
I'd like to see you try.
James you better back off.
James you see my kids back there?
You know how much I'm paying for private school?
Nice how that works out.
The only one to ever leave the country.
So what's your story?
Look I've been working this case for months now...
And it's his party.
But hey I understand.
How you doing baby?
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Now get up!
I said get on your feet!
I'm busy at the moment.
She is nice.
I'll take that one too.
She can do my feet.
Oh yes she's very nice.
Let's start with that one.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
It's my first time.
Never leave home without it.
You save your money.
You bring American money?
Oh you American?
You're big time.
There must be something you want.
This money is evidence.
It's okay I got lots more.
I'm this way.
I saw that.
Walking away never looking back.
We made it man.
It's worth it to me.
It's not worth it man.
He's making you do this.
I got this.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Did she have a friend?
No you got it wrong there's no couple here.
End of the line.
Now that I believe.
What does she know.
As long as you're asking...
If she was the right girl you'd be thinking about her.
I think we should stop talking.
See you in the next world.
Maybe we should just end this right here.
Well we're not friends.
Why did you help me?
Look man I'm sorry.
I know you got a thing for her.
She never even looked at you.
We can help you.
Let me see it again?
Get it out of here!
There's people up here!
There's people down there!
It's your turn!
Pick it up!
She's walking back towards the door.
She just took her hair down.
Is it hot in here?
I said nothing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I've seen it a million times.
Why did she leave you?
All I do is work.
Never take a day off.
It's all I have right now.
He'll be back soon.
He just left.
They still just talking?
I love this stuff.
How do you know he's our man?
Every single one.
I should go back.
This is about your Daddy's death?
You could have told me...
This is about your Daddy's last case right?
Ask me if I give a shit.
Good at what?
You're not very good at this are you?
She's a school teacher.
Why the hell should you believe him?
I'm okay you go.
You would never understand my life.
When's the last time you took a night off had a date?
It's my job!
Who needs you.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
I want to show him a good time.
Try to land on your feet.
A god to these people!
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes.
You better take one.
Let me look at you.
I want to see some women.
But I'll help you.
Just trying to make it look real.
You move well.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Never shut up.
Let him find out on his own.
It's my responsibility.
My name has been written into the book of death.
and for such awful things to happen as they did --
He will report to me.
Say what it is.
This is a good thing.
Nothing bigger than a fifty.
The amount will be fifty million.
What you're seeing here?
This is my ""still"".
And that of course would be me.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Sir I can explain.
Oh I think you like this very much.
My country asked for the best.
I told them that was you.
Be sorry for Soon Young.
She has no chance now.
What do you hear?
You are my responsibility.
You hate me.
Good God ya'll!
It's not good-God you all!
It's Good-God ya'll.
That's not how it goes.
Who does not know War?
What is it good for?
Good-God you all.
You know War?
Now that's American music.
I'm full.
You want more?
Yeah it's good.
That is a problem.
I learn a great deal.
You control the space.
They took off.
Everybody take off?
When you go into a place like this the most important thing is control.
Nobody's from here.
So where the hell am I from?
I could not come.
If I had this might not have happened.
You get it?!
Oh yeah but this is on the way.
It's almost like a law.
-- what the hell is that?
And you need insurance.
Now that we understand each other...
show me how you did that.
We are both full of shit.
Okay fine you're full a shit I'm full a shit.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.
I like to let people talk who like to talk.
It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Full of shit?
It's the same thing!
Yeah well you're in American now.
You have one of these?
you know like what's your name?
shit like that.
Never to me.
I look like shit.
So why you look do down?
You in the back girl!
what happened to you?
This is my city.
You thing you can do that?
what do you want?
It's about a thirteen year old girl.
Unless we do something.
No way in the way!
And I need you baby.
And be careful.
What do you think I'm talking about?
How'd what go?
And I'm it.
Get a look under it.
What would you call that paper there?
Kind of a...
Okay let me start from the top.
I'm as good as it gets.
That's what you were supposed to be!
Hey man you can use her.
Four men just died in there!
What do you mean you lost him?!
How could you lose him?!
What the hell am I supposed to do with him?
I'm talking about the girl.
He is the situation.
How much they want?
Through his people.
Where do we find him?
How did I do this?!
And we already know...
You got a boy friend in here yet?
I will leave him on this side.
Then we trade places.
You get him I get her.
Word up mother...
Take the money with you tonight.
Please you must understand what happened today was not --
You have run out of time.
The amount now is two hundred million.
Can I speak with her?
You have twenty-nine minutes left.
You have what I asked for?
Where are you.
Yes sir me too.
I am so sorry about your men.
I am not an American Mr.
As I said sir we've got all the people we need.
I would like one of my people to help.
You will have many friends very soon.
After I left?
I was trying to find the right time.
That is how I found out.
I still have work to do here.
I'm not running.
You're not running right?
""I'm not...
What is he up to now?
Got any last minute advice?
How about -- ""I hope you'll be very happy together""?
What do you expect me to say to this?
I'm happy here where I'm supposed to be.
I'm sorry -- I mean I'm...
It happens to be how I feel.
What did we have in common back then...
What kind of music did you like...
What did he ask?
You talked to him!
He's here!...
We do it to our dog.
Eight is good...
I love his eyes.
I just believe they're listening to you.
""Be the ball.
She's already done this.
That only took us between years to say.
Is that what I did to you?
Did I just not see you?
That's not nothing to do with it.
Look he's running after her.
Just call me when you have it.
That's New York living.
I just found out I'm best man!
Your job is...
Do you have the ring?!
I have no idea what I'm doing.
And someone will tell me what to do.
Then you'll be my best man.
Of course we are.
Okay we'll order out.
Then come for dinner.
You're coming here?
Look -- I'll be in there later today.
I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Then you've got it.
Okay you were right.
It is a good story Fish.
How would you like to get some?
What are you trying to say to me Fish?
I'm in a different position now...
I call it like I see it.
Same as you said.
Well I'm off.
Oh I will.
Well you let me know.
Not seven like they said.
I have an actual fact for you.
I just got one.
It's nice that they're still friends.
This game is pretty important to him.
No she's talking about your hair.
I think you'd look good in red.
Like her mother.
This we know.
This is getting serious.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
You here on business?
I've been making friends with your cat.
Is it okay that I'm here?
So we'll...
I'm okay with that.
There's the two of us.
So you think...
And the church.
About a minute...?
Come on it'll give you a great view.
No that's called not having a mind of your own.
Just like now.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
It's high.
Well they should.
I had it under control.
Now they feel sorry for me.
Are you all right with this?
You think this is funny?
It's kind of nice.
Then we'll come back for him.
You know there's no...
I'll have the same.
That's better than fine.
Maybe you should ask her some time.
Ever thought of that?
Is that what you said to her?
You afraid to try?
You've seen the post-its.
Actually I meant you.
I'll take your check.
My point is that one again you're getting it all wrong.
How do I do it?
I'm not that beautiful.
You've been here for three minutes.
He is not!
Look look man.
I still have my job.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.
In my heart...
I've never been more certain in my life.
You'll answer my questions?
You still think that he was....
Just make time.
Let's just get there.
She's really found it.
I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
""Hey man check me out"".
Good morning to you too.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.
For what reason?
Can we talk about my life now?
He's totally out to get me.
Yes I've seen it.
I'll eat in my room.
I changed it.
See you later Mr.
That guy has a problem...
This one's on me.
You're her best friend.
No you tell her.
You turn it on you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Is there somebody else?
I'm just not up for it.
No that's free.
But it's on the water.
It's not a boat boat.
It's really a house.
Is it up is it down.
You go out in them.
You come back in them.
It sounds nice.
I think that's what I'm saying.
Let's leave that out of it.
It was just...
You see what I mean.
And you know what I think?
I think that it was almost...
It's normal right?
Ever since Christmas you've been different.
And then I'll see you in New York --
When you get back I'll be gone --
Not for the kind of place I want to do.
It makes no sense at all.
Thank God my life is in place.
I'll see you at work.
With the radio.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Happy New Year darling.
I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Not even when I was young.
Even when you were young?
I told you they would love you and they did.
Is that all right with you?
This is a big moment for me --
Am I what they had in mind?
This is right.
It was written before I went out there.
What about the letter?
Made for each other.
Well it's the same woman.
She looked just like this --
He said hello.
But he saw you right?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Go on turn it on.
Turn on your radio!
Listen to this I love this part --
And then you left him?
He lost weight there and you left him?
He lost all the weight...
""I want to meet you...
I mean what if I never meet him?
I just have to get this out of my system.
Read it to me.
They knew it.
It was right.
It was real.
Now we're getting down to it.
That's what she called him on the show.
Nothing's with me.
What was that about up there?
You should write something about this.
I just want to find out about him.
No I know that part --
he's involved with my sister...
Go home for the weekend.
however long it was.
Oh God it's major.
I have to stop this.
I wanted him to find a wife but he's got the wrong one --
But when you met her did you believe she was the only person for you?
Well fine fine.
And how's it working?
And then he held my hand.
And I knew.
It's silly really.
tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
We'll move them --
The one in the street.
It's me?
What about health?
you're home.
It's almost like...
Sure you do --
Thanks but I'll pass.
It's kind of a big night.
The whole town knows.
But what the hell.
It's not one specific thing.
What was it that made you know?
When I met my wife it was so clear.
It's hard to imagine.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife?
Maybe even more?
What's she talking about?
The number to call is...
It's been about a year and a half.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this.
Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Jesus are we on the air?
Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Is he home right now?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.
Now it's Christmas and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
It's not for me.
It's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.
Got me there.
How come you're up so late?
It is not --
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Things are different.
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.
This can go on for years.
Where did I hear that recently?
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.
What women are looking over okay?
That's not what I need your help for.
I want to know what it's like over there.
I have forty-two.
How much money do you have?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
You have to find her.
Your only hope.
Dad could you close the door?
What do you mean okay?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
It was all they had.
Listen have I ever done anything really stupid?
When I found you?
You said we could go to New York.
This conversation is finished.
This is the one I like.
I have to have a life.
I have to do things that I want with people my own age.
It might be in the kitchen.
The one who wrote us.
Why does she do this?
That is all I am doing.
That's what single people do they try people on and they see if they fit.
It's a short word.
I just called for a second.
Everyone at work heard you.
Did you call that radio station again?
Thanks for dinner.
Time for bed.
Just this one part okay?
Listen to this --
Now I'm late.
This is a good letter Dad.
I look stupid.
I look like I'm trying too hard.
This one's for both of us.
have a date with someone Friday night.
I'm starting to forget her.
about you and how you are which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.
So what is that?
They ask you.
I wonder if it still works this way.
This is not how you do it.
Somewhere in the middle.
"" Where is that?
How did they get our phone number?
They called and asked for it.
So I can go.
Does anyone know?
What's the matter with this one?
No I'm not but --
You better hope so.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
It's never happening again.
About last night?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.
There's somebody on the phone for you.
I'd really like that.
Well here's the number.
Look I met somebody.
We hit it off.
"" Did you ever see it?
Now that I'm seeing someone it's a whole other thing.
It'll take him a while to come around.
I tried to talk to her...
It was like I knew her.
He's over at the boat show.
He'll be by later.
It's so beautiful here.
God it's wonderful to see you.
Eventually in a few months you'll start seeing women you'll meet someone.
Any one of them five minutes and done.
Ready to eat.
When I come back maybe the two of us should spend some time together on our own.
It takes time --
He's good at it.
He's ten.
I know her pretty well.
Maybe I could call her --
I'll get the check and I'll call you in eight months.
You could have called me --
You look good yourself.
I know your work record.
Want to go up to your office Mr.
I told you it would happen.
Got any more ideas?
Not so sure about that.
Letter of the Law you know.
What does he want to do about 'em?
Question question -- the problem what to do about 'em.
The woman question?
I tell you something.
How goes it?
Take a drink.
You were back at the station.
It was all clear...
In one piece.
Well you're all in one piece.
and they run away.
Come in we'll work it out.
Sit down sit down.
We're taking over.
We'll get some action.
It'll make him sick.
We got to.
In the company office.
To the mine?
This is what we've been waiting for.
Will you be still?
And what will I get out of it?
I'm low enough already.
But why must you say to me ""Stay in your place.
After what you've been doing?
Why are you afraid to have me at your side?
I need friends.
Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
But I can feel it coming.
Who said anything about giving up?
You mean you're ready to give up?
It's a lot to them.
They'd do anything to open that mine.
We're doing all right.
But you are needed.
Especially now -- with most of the other men away.
I'm not needed here.
Not this way.
But you wanted to talk.
All right but later.
I've got a meeting now.
We've got to have a talk you and me.
Not to go back to the line?
But it's nice to be home.
I've had them since the day they were born.
I've had these kids all day!
Can be what?
NO she wants to be there.
And there's Mrs.
She's got to be there.
I should be there with them.
But it's yours.
Let them take it!
We lose the union.
And the men know this.
Hope for our kids.
And I'd say to myself think of something nice.
And then I'd think of you.
They say I am no good to you.
What were they saying?
He'll have it good.
You'll never have it so good.
let this child live...
Mother of God...
I did forget.
for saying you never thought of me.
The children are watching.
Is that all you care about?
I'll have my baby.
What has it got me your union?
Then we'll work on these other things.
Leave it to the men.
The safety of the men -- that's more important!
Do you think I like living this way?
What do you want of me?!
Every time I remember.
The fire's gone out.
This water's cold again.
I listen to it.
It was so nice to listen
Was it right that we bought this...
Look who's talking!
But there's another thing...
like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife ""Who's that?
And I've had enough of it!
Well if that's possible...
The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.
You're not the Company President by any chance?
But you've got me doing everything.
You've got to help around the house!
There's lots of ways we can help.
We seen 'em!
Come down here!
I know it's wrong.
Just let me go.
I'll leave town...
just let me go.
I had to get a job...
listen for the love of God...
I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
So my kids get sick.
Does the company doctor wait?
""Pay -- or we take it away.
To hang on to what we got -- and like it!
You wait till you're ready so you can win.
I was talking to my wife.
That's how come I told you about it.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom.
Nothing I'm trying to remember...
I told you all of this.
How about in the house?
I'll have to live with that.
Just go across the street and watch.
Then I want you to get out of the room.
I want to do this for you.
I want to do something good for a change.
I could have done something.
I been that way ever since.
From day one.
Find a new job.
He knows where I work.
You can still work.
I'm kind of busy.
Why do you find that so hard to believe?
This has nothing to do with him.
It gets me through the day.
: What are you up to?
Is that how you play?
It's the only way to play.
How far out of town?
He's out of town.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Just give me one good reason.
There's nothing to understand.
Leave me out of this.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
I'd like to help you out...
Hey you did the right thing.
That's when he called me.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Is that what you want me to do?
Put it all on Jesus?
I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
I want to keep it.
I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
It was easy.
Left before it was over?
When did you ever see me use?
I've seen you.
I never had.
Hey check it out...
You're my best friend man.
I'd do anything for you.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Was he the president?
You want a hit?
Yeah that's what I mean.
Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You mean like to throw 'em off?
Can you set that up?
I mean we'd have to talk to him.
Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
You remember that guy you told me about...
That's just what I'm talking about.
So why'd you want to see me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
You got anything for me?
I've seen you around.
I know a guy.
That was my idea.
It was just a test.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
come on man.
I thought we had a deal.
You want to do this some other time?
Hey I was just trying to...
I think of you as a brother already.
But I just met you.
Anything for a dear friend.
Can we talk price?
Answer the fucking question!
can we talk about this?
I thought you'd be happy.
He told me -
You've got no choice.
What're your taking down?
I met the guy at a party.
Question is what are you doing here?
Look we'll talk to the A.
Now take the money.
Just the way the world works.
It's not my place.
No last name?
You got a name?
You go boy.
I've got a hot one.
I'm making the small buy tonight...
If everyone is happy we'll do the big deal later in the week.
That would be me.
Now that I can help you with.
What's on the other end of this thing?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one.
He's the only one I told.
I been at this for almost a year.
And what does this have to do with me?
This the guy?
You have every right.
You know what gets old?
It gets old.
I wanted you to ask back there.
You know before you got us lost.
Look at that place.
You think that's a good idea?
There's a house up there.
Hey do you think you could eat me if you had to?
I was talking about Miles.
Again I thank you.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in.
We're in business.
It's just not good.
This could be the one we're looking for.
I thought you were done.
Here's the deal...
He's worth a lot more than that.
Alright I'll give you that.
A private sir?
Where are your men now?
alright let me know when.
Shit that was no big deal.
Did you see what he did back there?
Forty-two-hundred I figure.
Not where I come from.
As a matter of fact I am.
Like hell you did.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Last I knew.
I know this for a fact.
To each his own.
Sir I understand.
I most likely would have sir had I been given the opportunity.
That's better but you've still got a long way to go.
Sure you got one?
Same place we are.
The men said nine.
Over three-hundred.
It seemed appropriate.
You think the rest of us were?
Like I said it was nothing.
Sir I'm sorry about what happened I...
Just what I want to do.
You want me to take over?
John I've got to tell you I think you're about used up.
Look at my hand there it goes again.
That's over three hundred men.
Maybe five hundred.
Any number you want.
Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?
It was great it made everything so much easier.
And what about your own hand?
She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game.
Bits and pieces.
You know why I'm such a good officer?
Have I ever told you about her?
He's done this before.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
How about you shut up and take your position?
How about you take your position?
How about I go right sir?
It comes and goes.
Is it getting worse?
Three for three.
You think they'll be alright?
Afraid of bad news?
Since when have things been normal?
That's not what we're here for.
Got it sir.
I've got a line on one.
Twenty minutes ago.
What about the company?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
The other five right behind.
They know that they are dead men.
Knows what that means.
That's not where I am.
HERE THEY COME!
See to it.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.
HERE WE COME.
WE'RE COMING IN.
you see what I'm saying sir?
There's nothing to find.
I've given this a lot of thought sir.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.
I thought you said we had an hour sir?
We're moving out.
Sir I've got an idea let's go around.
Up get it?
Easy for you to say sir.
It's a personal thing.
Ours is not to reason why.
Sure what do you want to know?
I'm listening sir.
Yeah how so?
man you're the best.
oh please sir...
Stay at it until you get fire control.
He was the best friend I ever had.
I'd like to go sir.
Alright come with me.
I want you right next to me no matter where I go you understand?
You hear me Private?
Just wait I can do much better than this.
He needed someone to take care of him.
Hey I got a mother.
What are we likely to run into?
Somebody must know where he's from what he did for a living.
Twenty-four-five.
Since I was nine years old.
No no he's not.
How can you how can you say that?
You're trying to get me to say something that's why you're telling me all of this.
Well take a look around the house.
Is everything nice but not too nice?
But I look awful and I feel awful could you could you please talk to me?
We never heard from them.
I sold her house for them made them money.
This evening is over.
I have people here.
You're very kind.
Oh yeah let me give you another card.
I'm sorry but they turned down your card.
Thanks I like yours too.
I'll take the whole set.
Good for her.
Are you getting a set together?
I'll be home soon.
what do I do?
How can I get her back?...
Forget it forget it it's mine it's mine!
I'll be in my office.
If it's such a big deal I'll go.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Why do you eat that stuff?
There's no food in your food.
I hope you understand.
If she wants me she can come to me.
No you're not a guy.
You've got to do something special.
You've got to make a statement.
EVERYTHING has changed.
No matter what you might think nothing will ever be the same between you two.
You might be sixty.
You might be walking down the street and you'll talk to her about something whatever.
Nothing's different.
Hang in there man.
I'm a good person but you are a great person.
Okay I got it.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Alright Okay here.
Look at those eyes.
Then what's love?
But you never had a first date.
okay okay I remember.
Let him do what he wants.
I'm sorry talk.
You know I just sit here listening and you never let me talk.
I told him not to speak.
I told him to be himself.
What is wrong with this girl?
I can put that together.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
He's been getting it from every end.
I'd love to hear his story.
The new me.
Believe in myself answer to no one...
No I will.
That's right work it out.
I would have done anything for you.
You let me believe you.
how could you...
You think you know what this money is?
How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
What am I supposed to think?
But I found the money.
Dad did you do it?
Did you take that money?
Dad are you okay in there?
You know what's best.
If I pick it up we'll only get back together.
Dad I love him.

Dad you and I have talked about this.
Well listen to me.
What do you have in common?
I like him a lot.
Alright let's stop this right now.
You can say anything to me I hope you still know that.
You've always called before always.
Now I'm not asking what you did I just want to know that you're alright.
Dad I'm so sorry.
I know this is a bad time.
You bet you should have called.
You still live at home.
Dad I'm sorry.
Okay I give up.
Which they did.

What a great line!
We've gone to school together for three years...
I might cut that part out.
If they ask you questions and they probably will ask you questions would you please say something nice about him mum?
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.

This is me telling you about me.
Alright it's alright.
Nobody thought we'd do this.
Not right now thanks.

Forget I said it it's what I thought I meant but forget it.

Like I just held them far away from me and they did the same to me.
They knew of you.
Now they know you.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
He does this every year?
Would you hold this for me?
This is really great.
Excellent alright this is great.

Are you busy on Saturday?
Yeah I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Friday?
Oh thanks but I'm busy.

Quick question - do you know who I am?
What a day.
You called me?
The real world.
Hey man I was in love once.
Man you never had a chance with a girl like that.
No my brother you have to go buy your own.
He's back.
Poor little man.
Just her name.
Are you alright sir?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything and I've decided something.
Maybe no one's listening or maybe your father's listening.
Mr Court if you're listening to this hello how are you?
I'm totally and completely serious.
Well we pay for the [?
How do you pay for one of those?
Is she around?
Really quite a car.
I can see by your face no.
no this is her father.
I'll take...
Just stop playing with her mind you know?
She's a person.
They're all about you.
How many people really know what they want though?
I mean a lot of them think that they have to know right?
I mean there's no possible way.
That's all the stuff I can show you it all says the same thing.
This is great this gives me hope.
Yeah but how come it worked?
I mean like what are you?
I called her up.
Yeah hey oh god.
Listen I wanted to...
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow help you clear up or something.
Good on you man.
Alright I love you too.
I love you man.
I love you man
Now you're back.
Things worked out.
Sir the list is correct.
Well let's find him.
If that happens -
Should I stay?
It's a beautiful city.
You would though.
You know what you'd like her.
All right okay let's talk.
I'd love to it'll have to wait until I get back.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.
What's a person worth to you.
They need that.
It's good business.
Where's the money in this?
These people my people I want my people.
You want these people.
They're taking mine.
You took my workers.
What do you want for him I'll give it to you.
He's important to my business.
You held back the one man most important to my business.
I pay you too much.
Well you've been through it.
You could make things easier for me.
Do you have any idea what's involved?
Yeah what's that?
You're right it's bad business but it's over with it's done.
But that's good business.
It's bad business.
They're mine!
They're not gone they're here.
I go to work the other day there's nobody there.
We started without you.
What do I got for you?
You want to stay on it?
What do you got for me?
Of course I'm on it.
You know about the list?
You're on it.
Yeah I can.
This is not my problem.
That's great thanks.
I work hard for you.
I'll continue to work hard for you.
I want to thank you sir for giving me the opportunity to work.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over have some dinner some of the people are coming over.
I mean where have you been?
Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I'm having a drink come on in we'll have a drink.
Things are great things are great.
See what you can do.
What's the matter everything all right at home?
Nice things cost money.
It kind of looks that way.
I'd like my wife to have that chance.
So we should hang him for it?
He's a friend of yours you want to help him out.
I've yet to see it.
So I'll talk to him about it.
That's not all right.
They're the ones.
It's the others.
I'd never ask you for money you know that.
You did so much.
If I'd made more money...
If I'd just...
Look at them.
I could've got more...
if I'd just...
No no what what is it?
You'll lose money.
I see a difference.
So would you.
We'll get it right one of these days.
They have to understand.
These are start-up problems.
I'll write them a letter.
Eight hundred give or take.
Four hundred four fifty -
Well I'll talk to somebody.
I think it's too late.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
You came into my office.
All right he does enjoy it so what?
What do you expect me to do about it?
You have to think of it in his situation.
And he's got the war.
Never the good always the bad.
Always the bad.
He'd be all right.
What other point is -
I got to go I'll see you.
The war could end.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Better this month than last?
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.
We're doing well?
But it's less.
That's the point I'm trying to make.
He gets nothing.
Something they can hold in their hands.
I'd pay them back in product.
They can trade it on the black market do whatever they want everybody's happy.
That's the easy part.
In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.
There's taking money and there's taking money you know that.
He's taking money.
What's he done that's so bad - take money?
We're here to make money all of us.
Would it do any good?
We're aware of that.
We know that son.
On national television.
You're sure about this two person thing?
I'll call now.
It's hell week.
No it's me.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
What if I said you?
Who do you want to speak with?
Nobody's here.
I thought you were someone else.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
I'm  on my way.
I had to change.
Did anyone call?
I just thought if I saw you face to face maybe it would help.
I wish it was just a year.
I have nothing now.
Look at me this is what I've become.
What could I say that would make a difference?
You wrote me a letter.
I did that.
I'm just taking it as it comes.
You've come to far.
You made sure of that.
Finish what my son started.
Where do you think he got it?
It all starts in the home.
And are the police sure about that?
Well you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Answer a few questions?
Look I'm sorry about the face.
What's your subject?
But nobody wants to see that.
This is a set up.
Then I'll make this easy for you.
Until you say otherwise.
What about your film?
Have you even started it?
Let us decide that.
I think it's out of your control.
I got behind.
Where have you been'?
What can I do'?
Too many ""That's her"" looks.
I called as soon as I heard...
Or it found us.
Yeah we really had our work cut out for us.
Who wants to?
Yeah how can we help?
I got it..
They went off together.
There's nothing.
I'm coming down.
No wait here.
Maybe they never got here.
He could have taken her anywhere.
It's both of them.
That's not the way it's done.
Can we turn the light on?
Something like that?
I think you're all an act.
You're a hard one to figure out.
No I'm the one who's sorry.
I see you read the book.
Hey I got stuff to do.
But I'll find you later okay.
The police are waiting outside.
Just in case...
I'll just get used to it.
They'll find the guy.
How could it happen?
Nobody did anything?
Watch your back.
The story's not over.
It's what you want from me.
That's not the way we play the game.
It's good to see you involved.
I really should hate you...
The safety what?
Stay under the safety light.
Help is on its way.
I need the police.
And I want the whole world to know it.
You know what happens.
""If I should stay.
I would only be in your way.
So I'll go.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Can I come with her?
It's okay to break girl.
Let's see how it goes.
Time to change numbers again?
as if seeing for the first time...
She looks in.
Get out of the house.
Easy black boy.
Just to leave her like that?
I've been waiting for you baby.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I just love being a sister.
""Do you want to...
"" Is that the best you can do?
I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Am I close?
But she's standing right next to you.
She's not here right now.
We can stay.
Come on baby.
You are so not funny.
I'm sorry I'm sorry but I had to.
It was too easy.
It'll be okay baby I'll hold your hand.
He's after me.
I've been here all night.
she gave me a job.
It was a bad idea.
Do you work for her now?
I know I'm stupid.
I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid.
No the other one.
The one who played his wife.
Those poor poor people.
I just hope none of us end up dead.
I bet they are.
I bet you did such a great job.
Of course it's me silly.
Alright I'm here.
Now for the final part of the game.
Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.
But I did everything you said to do!
Maybe so but right now we play the game.
Here's how we play.
I ask you a question.
What kind of a game?
More of a game really.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
Well ya got me.
Listen I'm busy.
Can you please go away now?
Maybe you've heard of me?
And either Mr.
So where is she?
Actually there was more this time.
This time we found a picture too.
There are five.
I know you need my help.
And I know you know I need your help.
I'm always there.
I thought you wanted me to stick around.
And who would that be?
So is that why you're here?
Oh yeah how?
How is that good news?
Till I found out I was wrong.
What did you know about your mother?
I think you know about that.
No they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.
Call me Mark would you?
Did you call her from the set?
There's someone here who wants to help.
Could be days before we find her.
that is if she's even there.
She was there too.
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her Mr.
They've got her!
I'm out back.
I can see nothing's changed.
He called me last night.
Do you want us to come with you?
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Do you think he did it?
I'm sorry this is too good!
The boys said no.
We tried  we're different.
So it's off to London for a week?
New York for a month?
'  But now you're here.
Why would the police come to you?
We need to know where she is.
Can you imagine the press?
But you know who she was.
They came to me check it out.
I remember her!
So what does it matter?
Oh Come on!
Oh I wish I got that one on tape.
There a story in that building?
Need to get in that building?
Here's how I see it.
So now starting now I go where you go.
He's not dead!
Who's phone?
Look what's important is that we stick together.
I know right.
I'm saying things got out of hand.
Are you saying she was-
No press on the set!
No press no press on set!
Get that woman out of here.
You mean what's left of us.
ALL OF YOU.
Get my point?
Hey I just got an idea.
Maybe I should Have a look at your break line.
That your car over there?
Who's this.
The part where we win!
Listen I have no time for this.
I've heard this shit before!
Come on who is this?
Hang on let me get some clothes.
You're not happy with your part.
Oh it's no problem I'm just...
I'm here for a make-up test.
I'm just saying though.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend.
Alright I'm here now show your  face so we can finish this.
I thought you wanted me here?
You're doing real good.
I'll call you when you get there.
I'll call you when you're on your way.
How do you know I'm not someone in your head?
Somewhere you know.
The question is who's with me.
We play in my court this time.
The final act?
So you think.
Let them try.
You'll never find me.
I want to finish what I started.
I want to finish the game.
No I need to call you.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
How can I help you.
She looked dead.
It's on the table.
we were left for dead...
Why did we save you for last?
You took my mother so I took yours.
It's an easy game.
We ask you a question.
He's been waiting around all night.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Why are you always at me?
that's quick.
She'll be there.
How'd you do?
No one's saying you did.
And last night?
I just wanted to see her that's all.
We're on it.
We already played that game.
You lost remember?
I called my dad.
But this is life.
But you're right -- enough is enough.
It's not the same thing.
This is the way it is.
She's not coming back.
One year tomorrow.
It's been a year since she died.
Hey hey it's just me.
Are you okay...
You know what my dad will do to you?
I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
Oh it did?
Now that it's out of your system.
My dad's in the other room.
A front door and a back one.
What door am I at?
Answer the question and I will.
I'm afraid...
he's out.
That's the wrong answer.
Then answer the question.
Please go away!
But you're doing so well.
Now for the real question.
Come on yes you do.
Turn off the light.
What kind of game?
How do you know his name?
So you better leave.
Look enough is enough.
They'd never make it in time.
I told you not to hang up on me.
What do you think I said?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Why do you want to know my name?
You never told me your name.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
I want to talk to you for a second.
What number is this?
it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
I should probably take just you.
If you're sure it's alright?
Thought you might like to join me.
Not much story here.
You never know when or where a story will break.
That's quite alright.
I just missed you.
She's with me.
I just wanted to check on things.
What is she doing here?
Have they found my father?
You girls ready.
And my Dad?
Any word on him?
Not yet but we're looking.
If you need anything...
Any word on my Dad?
Hold off for now.
Just stay close to her.
She's with my sister.
Should I bring her in?
You think he could still be in town?
They believe he's out of state by now.
If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
He's our man.
Where the hell you been boy?
I want you to take look around.
But these kids today...
But it'll be morning before we see something.
Have to be.
The shit she's gone through.
What were you doing out here?
I can hear her.
Oh Mother of God I can hear her.
I told you to send it back.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
When did that ever stop you?
You want to go live?
Has his story changed?
Just stay back.
I'll look for it.
It'll be out later this year.
She's just doing her job.
And why would she do that?
What if she did it?
The girl has some serious issues.
I think she made it all up.
Can you see me right now?
So where are you?
The question is not who am I.
The question is where am I?
so call if you need me.
Working thank you.
Like you had one.
He came to make up.
Which is you...
A very simple one.
I think her father did it.
So what's his reason?
The why'd the police let him go?
You coming tonight?
Takes a man to do something like that.
You'll never get away with this.
It's all part of the game.
To talk and...
Remember there's safety in numbers.
My parents are out of town.
Tonight my house.
This is like Christmas.
"" It's a real turn on.
Remember that show?
He better not be.
I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
And you believe it?
There's been talk about other men.
Your dad was always out of town on business.
This could be good.
You had good reason to think what you did.
Shit what is he doing here?
I want you to meet me here right after class okay?
He could be here at school right now.
You're at school now.
No one can get you here.
I need to talk to someone.
No nothing's like it used to be.
Her dad's out of town.
She was supposed to pick me up.
It's past seven.
I'll be there by seven.
I'll pick you up after practice.
You sure I can stay over?
Even worse than...
Well it's bad.
This is big.
Do they know who did it?
Do you believe this shit?
We had to start without you.
It goes to court now.
No employment history.
We may never know how he got that way.
He's been doing it for quite a while.
That's not necessary.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.
""  Give it to me.
decide for yourself.
I read about it in the paper.
It would be too hard.
Tell them thank you.
He's not finished.
It's not supposed to make sense.
It's always been like this.
Did you read in the paper today about the man who was walking his dog?
I'll work on the house.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
There was a second.
I know what you're thinking okay?
In six days you're all the way gone.
It will go on and on.
and he made it happen.
He made me do it!
He made me put that...
that thing on.
He made me wear it...
You or him?
she was on the bed.
She was just sitting on the bed.
Where was the girl?
and he said...
Put it on the ground.
Hands on your head!
Her pretty head.
It's not too far away now.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.
You need to turn left here...
at the traffic light.
I want you to know I wish I could have lived like you do.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.
I wish I could have a simple life.
It's close.
Tell me what it was that gave me away.
It's in those eyes of yours though...
I'm not special.
This is though.
What I'm doing.
Tell me it's not true.
Well I have to tell you...
I can tell you this.
I mean can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
You know he's fucking us.
When do we get to question him?
As soon as this is over I'm gone.
You knew I'd say yes.
One of two things will happen.
Oh you want to stay now?
Call for help and you'll live.
That part of me is dead.
""  But you're already here.
You've been here a long time.
Oh you're so much better than everyone right?
Well you're not!
It's just a man.
You follow the law and do the best you can.
You do your job...
You tell me then...
Especially after today?
Face it now.
If we get him I'll be happy enough.
I'm trying alright?
Just tell me what we've got.
We could use about fifty more men here.
We had him.
You stupid son of a...
Think it through.
He'll walk.
Think about how we got here!
Think about it...
We get in there and we can stop him.
You been talking to my wife?
Oh you are?
Well come with us then if it's okay.
We'll take a look at him.
It'd be just too easy.
It's not what you think it is.
How do you know all about this?
It might give us a name.
from then on.
Well that was money well spent.
What does all that matter anyway?
It's not our job to figure him out is it?
And so what?
his first words to us.
You've seen that.
To the day!
I mean Christ...
This is the job.
Oh it's alright.
I want him bad.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
I never gave it a second thought.
See I was doing really good up till then.
right between the eyes.
It was my first one of these.
Why would we?
They were there...
so it must be.
Does this make it with you?
I've seen the same.
Oh that's all.
All we do is pick up the pieces.
Then you tell me what you think we're doing.
I wish I still thought like you.
You meant what you said to Mrs.
have you ever seen anything like this...
been involved in anything like this?
He's fucking with us.
What if it's not that she's seen something?
This is the one thing.
He had to get back out.
Parts of them.
Did you read them?
She was away on business.
All day Saturday and all day Sunday.
To have to sit there and decide.
Where do you make the first cut?
Well his body was found Monday night okay?
But get this...
You've never seen ""The Odd Couple?
""  This is sick.
And I accept.
I asked you not to call me here.
You get the phone with the office.
Can we talk about this in private?
It's too soon for him.
This is his stuff.
I've been out in the cold all day.
He took his time.
It could be nothing.
Near the food?
Yeah well all I want is...
I did all that shit for a long time.
Seen the things I've done?
Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
No one yet.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
I realize that.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.
I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.
however you want it to go.
You just met me.
before you decided to...
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?
Meet the people.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar...
After that, we'll...
Are you absolutely certain?
I'm sorry about this, Mrs.
I can tell you now, I know...
I'm positive I made the right decision.
I want to have children.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work...
I hate this city.
I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
You should look into private schools.
He mentioned it.
I know I'll get used to things.
Talk to him about it.
He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I'm sorry, I only...
It's a hard place.
I mean, you known this city.
You've been here for so long.
If you can, please call me.
I have to go now...
What do you think so far?
Just ask your husband.
It really does.
I was close once.
I mean interesting.
It's really none of my business.
That's how he is.
High school and college, yes.
I mean, thank you.
Please, sit down.
My husband has told me a lot about you...
Did their son see it happen?
This is a done deal.
Why always like this?
Only after the fact...
It was nothing new.
And stay close...
You're my brother...
They gave up...
What happened to 'em?
It just happened to be me...
No need to make any more of it...
Only I wish...
That's enough...
I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
It was, I tell you!
Why'd they break off?
That'll be the day!...
You've said that enough!...
maybe they're both dead...
gets that horse up...
Let's get along...
or my brother's.
Why'd they do a thing like that?
AND other things...
She sure is!...
In that case, give the boys room...
Another one, eh?
I say NO!
but maybe it's your right to know.
There sure is!
But I'll tell you now.
Enough to go around...
How many, would you say?
You got one now!
and that's an order!
What do you know about it?...
What good does that do?
You can forget that...
But he knows THAT, sir...
and where he's at...
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Well you found me...
Good work, son...
Hold on, son...
These are my people...
I've come now...
come and get me...
Take me home...
They have done...
They are my people...
an' I got away...
try to remember!...
I found a man's seen her...
You were born old...
No sir, not too good...
Now they're out there...
They was here...
You got it with you?
How'd you come by this?
That'll be the day...
I know you are...
and you know it.
What's that got to do with us?
You can keep your will!
They'll be back...
Get out of here while you can...
He's got to...
It's him or us.
Stay out here.
Never heard of him...
She's not...
What's the sense in it!
She's YOUR wife!
Think she means for us to follow?
And if he has a girl with him...
You ask her!
Cut it out, will ya...
That's the way to train 'em.
Looks like Mrs.
Come on, Mrs.
Tell her she's got to go back...
Think it might be...?
Not so funny...
What's the idea...?
Now shut your head!
I always felt like she was...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
not in the long run.
for a while...
Tomorrow's another day...
Sure I'm all right...
I'll meet you on the far side.
Easy on that!
There's just the one thing we're after...
Nothing for you to see.
Well, come on!
What you want me to call you?
Time's running out...
Course it might take time.
There's one thing.
What do they call themselves?
Not far from it...
I've seen her...
You've seen her!...
She's not a little girl any more.
Yes, I remember!..
You ever see it before...
And if the girls are...
And he even has to write his full name...
They never find that girl.
Read the letter.
From the beginning...
Oh, all right!
Only if I'm dead!
I understand how it is...
the little I had...
One letter in five years...
I wrote you a letter...
Go on then!
Time for bed anyway...
We got two around that age...
She'd be about thirteen now...
How did you get me out of there?
Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I told you, there is no way out.
What are you talking about-
Like back then.
But no, you always have to have it your way.
Out of this house!
""  What the hell are you trying to say?
Come look at this!
She was old.
What am I supposed to sense?
In the village.
You should just hear yourself talk!
But that's not the point!
Where have you been all day?
I have everything I need.
Hey you're still here.
I suppose you like it here with us.
I have to go to town.
It took me two hours to make these.
You know it's not always easy for me either.
Someone from the village.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
So do I believe me.
Again and again I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Not a book fair.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Hey take your time.
Do you have a better idea?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Wait I'll take care of it.
Oh that was upstairs.
It still worked in town.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
You know how it is with women.
How is your book coming along?
So who are the two lucky ones?
You'll never get away from me!
Say it anyway.
Come on how much do you love me?
Come on say it.
It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case.
Go see him.
I really hate to bother him but...
I need to know what happened in there.
What happened back then?
Do I look like it that much?
You're from the city right?
No I've never seen him before.
That is I'm not sure but...
- I have to go...
Yes something was...
You mean like back then?
I think it's starting again.
If only I knew...
We need to be on our way.
Hey my man!
You can afford to spend some money.
Where do you want to have it?
Well look here!
A great light has gone out.
Ohwhat have I done?
Known her since she was this high.
Thank you my lady!
Do you know that house?
Yes I've seen you in something.
I know your face.
Follow that boat!
What is money to me like us?
You have the money?
You have the last act?
He paid me.
I will play him.
Bring it tomorrow.
Are you writing?
When I have fifty pounds.
How goes it Will?
I will see you in a week.
So now you are free to love
One day she was three months gone with child so
You have a wife children
I am here to help you.
Tell me in your own words.
Aye now and again but what of it?
I have not said all.
Yes I saw it.
Will what is the story?
I want no more trouble Mr.
Yes but very well.
But nothing is happening.
Oh it's coming it's coming.
Where is the play?
What have I done Mr.
There's never any
Put his feet in.
I have a wonderful new play!
Take his feet out.
Where will you get
I am so sorry Mr.
I am sorry Will.
How will it?
The show must  you know
Another little problem.
No it will turn out well.
We are lost.
By God Will if you do not who does?
By God I wish I knew.
The one who came with your letter?
Cut round him for now.
Well I to my work you to yours.
Well that seems to be everybody.
You will have a nice little part.
Have you finished?
God I'm good!
Cut out my heart!
You are writing it for me!
I gave you three pounds a month since.
Who wrote that?
Who is she this time?!
Where is my play?
Tell me you have it nearly done!
Tell me you have it started.
Yes that's good.
Always in and out of love.
What is the story?
I have a new one nearly done and better.
I love your early work.
""Not having that which having makes them short.
""Is the day so young?
Be good to her my lord!
You will not tell.
I will tell.
From tomorrow away in the country for three weeks!
Your mother and your father
Love like there has never been in a play.
I will have love or I will end my days as a.
I am not so well-born.
Oh when can we see another?
Oh but they can!
What do you love so much?
I have seen you.
Stand up straight girl.
How is this to end?
Lost your wife so soon?
I think you lost it today.
Did you like the play?
""I know not.
You left it in my bed.
Come to look for it again.
I could do it yesterday.
My pretty one!
I would not for the world!
If she do not send her back.
Like you I found him not at home!
I was in a play.
Write me well.
Good bye my love a thousand times good bye.
How does it?
It was we ourselves did that.
And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
""I have more care to stay than will to go.
It is not day.
Will you read it for me?
You were not dead before.
I saw our end and it will come.
And yet you let me come to your bed.
He was not dead before.
Then I will go with you.
What will you have me do?
Yes this is not life Will.
Oh but it will end well for love?
Oh but it is mine too!
""Good night good night.
Oh do not go
There is time.
Oh--no no!
You would not leave me?
Well perhaps better than my first.
And that was only my first try.
Even your play.
I would not have thought it.
There is something better than a play.
Oh not for the world!
You can bring them with a word.
Oh my lady my love!
Oh--I am him too!
He is dead?
--dear God I did not think it would be me to tell you.
Who is dead my lord?
I understand of course.
Good morning my lord!
It was your eyes.
But why me?
We will not stay there long three or four years.
That is the only matter under discussion today.
I do not love you my lord.
He has bought me for you.
You have been waiting.
So my lord?
I speak with him every day.
Yes by God!
I was born to look in them and know myself.
Is your lady beautiful?
Tell me is she beautiful?
Tell me how you love her Will.
Does she say so?
It is only ours you can know.
And break her heart and mine?
Of course you have not!
I have not written it!
I am very sorry sir I have not seen Act Two.
Let me see you.
Are you Mr.
Where did you learn how to do that?
You are on my ground.
Now I will show you your place which is in hell!
A man my lord?
Is there a man?
Here we come at last my lord!
I should have seen that long ago.
One for her and one for me.
Where do you think you'll go?
I mean remember that time when -- oh we could talk all night but we have to go.
For the best.
It's probably for the best.
Yeah I'm sorry but that's the way it is.
But they know.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Looking for you?
No I'm sure that'll be enough.
There's lots more.
Oh that'll come in useful.
I've worked on that paper for three years.
There was a break-in.
Yeah but you were good you were really good.
I love that guy but why does he have to follow us around?
I want to talk now.
Listen it's important.
I have an idea.
Can we talk about something?
Now come on all or nothing.
Is this necessary?
But not quite.
You're telling me you want out?
Is that fair enough?
Now what else?
You call them if you want.
Telephone the police.
I know you well enough.
It's sick.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
Come on David.
Can I show you something?
Yes or no yes or no yes or --
No she's not in.
Why thank you David.
He made it clear.
I'm only asking what you think.
Will you shut up and play.
All right just a few questions.
I know but you need a change.
But there's no --
Just one thing.
Oh no problems.
No not any more.
Take another look at these two.
I've never seen any of these men before.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
We thought you were someone else.
Oh yes it's great.
And you like it?
Let him take it all.
You've got to stop him.
It's about me and David.
That's what I thought he said.
I thought maybe I was --
That's important to me.
I'll wait there.
You'll wait in the hall?
Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that?
No definitely not.
And that's that.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Now you thought of that not me.
We could put it somewhere.
And the money?
Now I've been thinking --
But first -- him.
No but he's looking after the money so what's the problem?
You think he'll come down for that?
He'll come down.
Remember we did what we did we took the money.
It's nothing all for nothing if you do that.
You know we're right.
You'd feel much better about it.
That's my advice.
Is that enough for you?
No no it's different.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Then let's spend some money.
No one said anything.
Well you certainly had a good look around.
That's not him.
Keep him happy.
For ever and ever.
Is he listening to me?
And now you tell me.
But you're a doctor.
I thought we all were.
It's it's --
The guy's dead.
What more do you need?
I'm just looking.
I wonder how he did it?
Sorry about this but can you open the door?
Your new-found friends.
He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
And it's still there.
I will ask you once more what sort of car --
He's got a car?
His car's still there.
Know and love?
The man we know and love.
What I am.
If I wrote them that is.
Oh yeah sure if you want.
So we'll meet him then?
I mean that's where I normally find things.
-- more than anyone she has ever met.
In her whole life.
Well she had problems --
Be someone else like him.
One is enough.
And what happened to that girl that friend of yours the one that came round.
I really felt we had something.
She could have moved in.
For my life?
At a discussion group?
You'll meet someone wonderful.
Did you know --
What are we to make of this?
I mean what are you actually doing here?
Can you afford this place?
You mean I can have the room?
What was I trying to say?
Yeah well that's what she said.
That's why you're here you see.
You're sure of that.
No I've never seen them.
Yeah that's right that's it.
And these two other people did they hear anything?
Only three rather than four.
Write it down.
Which are you using?
Only three people here.
Who said there were four?
Not always of course but now four.
Well if you do you'll let us know?
No nothing sorry.
And that's about all I think.
I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Come on you should know.
It was on the television.
We already know.
All about it.
I should hope so.
With a face like this?
I thought you'd gone to work.
Who have you talked to?
Some friends maybe?
Someone you talked to?
That's what you paid for it.
Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it.
That's what it cost David.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Two hundred pounds?
Do you know many of these people?
Oh yes I'm fine thanks just fine.
Is this what they always look like?
Why do you want a room here?
Oh I see I thought you meant --
You get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm not sure --
Are you aware of that?
Exactly what I was --
What do we do here David?
Yeah here I mean where else?
That one last week.
What guy that died?
That guy the one that died.
What happened to that guy?
And that's not the same thing?
I write about it?
You know about it?
No just leave it.
He knows I must be at home.
Yes the telephone but if it's for me I'm not in.
Do you think you could answer that?
Writing seems easy.
You see it's better already.
Well maybe I'll change it.
Would you like to see the rest?
Seven six five.
How will you be paying?
The first one was fine.
Four hundred and eleven pounds.
Four one one.
Yes the first one's fine.
That's nine one two.
Five six five.
That sounds fine.
I mean that's what it's like.
Same as everyone else.
Look again if you like.
I'm sorry I've never seen any of them.
Take all the time you like doctor.
Well it's a small town.
What're you talking about George?
Things are great.
-- is that what this is all about?
-- yes we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in believe it or not.
-- is that right?
Just be straight for once in your life.
That's okay too.
Oh she's very nice yes -- I mean normally ---
I just thought you'd like to know --
Think you could do anything for me?
That's George.
why do you ask?
Did you have to bring her?
No that's okay I'll do It now.
You look great baby great.
I hope she's all right.
All I ever do is play.
I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
We have this political thing tonight.
You're looking great baby.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
-- I like myself far too much far too much.
You're late George.
I'll be right back baby really.
I'll be back in a while.
You're not her doctor.
That's very serious.
Who's her doctor?
She's got a...
it's got something to do with her...
I'll be right back it's just that this girl is a different girl...
Particularly in your business...
you deal with women every day...
Then it's not your problem.
Are you in love with her?
'd four times.
Now look that girl that called -- I have to talk to her she'll do something.
Hey I tried to get her off the phone.
Let it ring.
Want me to?
Nobody can hear it.
I am not like my mother!
That you're just like your mother.
Then what do you think?
what kind of a thing is that to do...
think that's funny too?
I never get my hair done.
do you have a thing about older women...
just you could look very heavy...
Making it with my mother?
Am I what?
I've made it with a girl...
I asked you first.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
have you ever made it with a guy?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
they're cold but they're good.
I do her hair yeah.
This is the one thing I like about this house...
She's out but you're supposed to wait.
You here to see my mother?
It'll save us both some time.
that's my point.
I'm the one they want.
If I had my own shop they'd leave and come to me.
After all Mr.
Jesus look at this.
You do know what money's like these days.
Right that's right.
And you need money?
So you want to go in business for yourself?
I went to school with her husband.
You are today.
I've got to tell him where I am.
What's too late about it?
Look we're not dead are we?
That's the only thing that's too late.
So I'm saying it...
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
I want to take care of you and I want your children and I want you to be my girl.
That's all I want out of my life and it's a lot.
Well then what are you trying to do-
It's not okay I mean we've got to talk now.
Forget about last night it's okay we'll talk when I get back --
Look about last night --
Please we'll have to talk later --
I've got to leave?
-- you've got to leave.
-- well you better go after her.
-- very nice very nice.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- where'd you go?
-- well if you feel like playing go play...
He never stopped.
That sounds like me.
You always say that...
-- Just get me out of here baby.
We're upstairs George.
Look at her hair.
what do you know about this guy?
Look either come in or stay out!
You did I know you did.
if I told you about her...
I just have to do one little thing.
There was nothing to know.
It was after you baby.
he tried to...
make it with me.
You still see him?
I mean great.
but I want you to know one thing.
I've got to look great tonight I mean I have to look great okay?
No I'm sure.
I'd cut it...
Where do you want to do this?
Shut up it's all right.
He's a very private person actually.
Oh about six weeks now...
How long you had this?
so how's everything with you?
-- Maybe she'll come with us.
your car down here?
Who's been doing your hair?
I'm busy man.
Hey what's happening?
She's heavy.
Then she played in it and got it all into something else.
-- took a bus.
-- how did you get here?
-- why did you come in today?
-- you know better...
you know better...
Are you sick?
Can you work?
That boy always does great.
-- Oh my yes.
-- yeah this is --
I hope you make it.
Hey baby what's happening?
Hey stop by the shop.
Yes yes I did.
George now cut this out.
that's not like you.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
That's all you've got to say?
I wish you'd go now.
Does it make you happy?
that'll help me...
not now but eventually.
-- no it'll help me really --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other...
I just want to know that's all.
-- and take this with you.
How come you took your own car?
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later.
-- I'll see you later...
I've got to get her out of here.
We're almost never here.
Maybe I should get a dog...
I'm trying to get a little bread together.
That's all I'm doing.
Look at my hair.
What do you mean what is it?
What is this thing tonight?
Look at the way I live.
What business meeting?
A business meeting I told you that.
Nothing I'll call you okay?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
When is that George?
When is that?
When I get off work.
Look baby can we talk about it later?
Just a second I'll be right with you...
No but I think they might.
I know but this is important.
I have to make a decision.
Baby I'm in the middle of work.
When can I talk to you?
I already said hello.
can we talk later?
Okay but how did it go at the bank?
Hey I'm you know --
Could I talk to you for a second?
How did it go at the bank?
You've never even been around one.
Of course I like children.
But in the same house you know one house.
We live together now.
Will we live together?
Why am I great?
Do you really mean that?
You're great.
You're different.
I am I am.
I just came from a meeting...
I'm getting it together.
How are you baby?
You'll do what I tell you.
You said somebody...
Well like what?
Let me come too.
just for a minute.
Well baby I'm George and it needs to be cut.
You need a cut.
What're you here for?
That's what she thinks.
I'm finished with her.
No man no.
I mean how did that happen?
Not if I had any choice in the matter.
You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are...
Probably I was.
Why why do you think that is?
that's just how it is...
look it's got nothing to do with you man.
yes I follow your thinking on that.
They fucking hate us!
Did they have something against me?
Was it me did you have something against me?
No not yet not yet.
That's got nothing to do with it...
Did you think you could get away with it did you think you could put something over on me?
What can I say!
I said sit down!
What do they look like?...
Well -- I could try.
Son we'll do business I can tell you that.
I know it son.
this doing hair it's...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
I'll be done in a minute.
That's okay that's okay just shut the door.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
We'll have a little time to talk there.
I mean I know.
When I finish work I want to...
They're not?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
It's good you want to do something George.
I make a lot of money for them.
More than they could do for themselves.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Come on by.
All right who're you with?
You're home.
Somebody's mother.
I was too old.
Well whatever I am I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Well maybe I can get you something.
Oh dear that's too bad.
-- get her out of here get her out of here.
You know what's wrong.
Jesus she's my best friend.
Does she know about us?
They get hair all over the place.
I'd like a drink.
Shut the door shut the door!
How about starting with tonight?
Yes I was talking to him.
Then you were talking to him.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Your own shop?
I called you about it.
I have to meet a client...
Well there was this one time --
I would say so yes.
Quite a while...
Well yes -- you know that about George.
it's not so much the number of times he does it it's...
he does it for a long time.
After four years?
Five times a day?
But you have problems?
Well they are.
But we have problems.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well it's George.
It must be something.
You're really a love -- you sure?
George is great but I know what you mean.
I spent three years with him.
Well he is.
I mean why?
-- he'll never know the difference.
-- just before I ask you out?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
This other couple that we're here with do you know them very well?
Getting your hair done...
Would you like to go to a party?
how do you a...
My God did I say that?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Continue about your friend.
That's fine --
-- there's not much room --
-- I'll get in the back --
Oh that's no problem.
I'd really like to go.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
No it's not that...
Look is there somewhere else you'd rather go?
how long did you say?
that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Oh say how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Everything okay son?
Everybody but us.
Have they sat down?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
I want you to like it here.
I wish we could stay here for ever and ever...
Do you feel bad?
I am Dad.
I want you to have a good time.
Are you having a good time?
Come here for a minute first.
You understand stay out!
Well sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago...
Well maybe things that happened...
Is there something bad here?
Try to think what it was.
Do they know he tell you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
How does he tell you things?
Who's Tony?
Come on son.
He only went to bed a few hours ago.
It's so pretty.
Look out - I'm coming in close.
What about Tony?
It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yes I'd like you to.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Talking to Tony.
Well it's just one of those things.
My husband had oh...
Only about three months.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Oh yeah he seems absolutely fine now but you should have seen him.
Shall we go into the living room?
Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
You give your word on that do you Mr.
For the moment Mr.
Only for the moment.
Will you indeed Mr.
I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Oh they're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment sir.
where are they now?
Why no sir.
Ah ha it's coming off now sir.
You're the important one.
No problem Mr.
Right this way Mrs.
Oh that's just great.
But how did you know that?
Yeah this is it.
Is it big enough for you?
Well I'm looking for a change.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
What line of work are you in now?
Bill how do you do?
Your money's no good here.
What'll it be sir?
I've been away.
Now I'm back.
Things could be a whole lot better.
Thank you for saying so.
You were always the best of them.
You're not to busy are you?
I'll bring back a doctor.
Stay away from me
I just want to go back to my room.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
and I'd like to know what they are.
Get him out of here?
I think he did it to himself.
Somebody did that to him.
Which room was it?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was understand?
maybe you'll let me read something then.
I just want to finish my work.
that's all it is.
Well something'll come.
Lots of ideas.
No good ones.
Any ideas yet?
It's really pretty outside.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's about eleven thirty.
God I've never seen anything like this before.
Boy we must be really high up.
Well it's very...
Is your family having a look around?
Well obviously some people can be
Well that is eh quite a story.
The police eh...
They'll love it.
How about your wife and son?
How do you think they'll take to it?
can of itself be a problem.
Well that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.
I'm eh...
Well that sounds fine to me.
Only in a very general way.
Oh it sure would be
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?
Let's see where were we?
I was about to explain that eh...
Well that's very good time very good.
Please sit down a minute.
Oh no problem at all.
How're you getting on?
Oh I'll say.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job.
As a matter of fact we eh...
All the best people.
Oh it's beautiful.
Well that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Can I tell you kids something?
Jane I have to talk to you.
You've just been sitting here all morning.
Let me help you up.
Honest to God.
Please take the money.
I want to make up.
What's the money for?
Did he really get his head cut off Dad?
Well it's probably nothing.
And my dad says it's kids.
I know how you feel.
I mean I know how stupid that sounds but...
it is his third.
That's what my sister says too.
You kids ought to go up to bed.
Dear boy you have gone right out of your mind.
I saw what I saw.
And what do you suggest I do about it dear boy?
He'd either be in the hospital...
Watch it dear boy.
What the hell does that matter?
It came for me!
Save this one for last.
Can you tell the difference?
I have to be out of my mind to be doing this you know.
Take it down the road a ways and back.
Do I need one?
Wait dear boy.
But you are you know- you are my dear boy.
Them doing that is just a...
Well I'm not sure that was.
They better get the guy.
You ever hear that one?
I will- be good kids.
You kids go to bed on time!
You've got school tomorrow!
Now go on!
So have I actually...
I wish it could always be like this.
you've always been that to him.
Did you see the people walk right in from the street?
So we'll be good in the future.
HE'S SO FINE...
I think they hear you!
You know what we're saying!
You know I just might!
I think I hear it!
How are you doing.
What you do?
Hey I know it's hard.
But do what I do.
And you listen to that?
Like oh baby you know you'll love it.
At Sunday School?
And you're...
Hit the road.
This is a private area!
I was with you.
But something happened.
And I'm different now.
And I've got just two words for you.
And those two words are...
I was good to you!
Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
She's afraid.
Come on tell the boys you're afraid.
What did you think you were doing?
And to say you're sorry.
About this afternoon.
And the things you said.
To thank me?
it's fine.
The best years of my life!
It's God!
We can still see each other.
Just like always.
Did he say you could leave her?
Did he say we'd be happy?
I wanted everything done right.
In the eyes of God.
How did I get so lucky?
What is it now five years we've been together?
Who do I thank?
The other woman.
What did who say?
Come on -- stay.
WISH HE WAS MINE.
HE'S SO FINE.
He's like...
It's true -- I know her.
That man -- who is he?
So use it.
Most music is.
Make me happy.
Let me hear it.
All right I am I know it!
All my life I've just been...
I was just a girl.
The big room.
An hour or so.
Better than me.
At my old place we used to...
To sell of course.
Not in years.
The minute I saw you.
Where did that come from?
But now thanks to all of you...
Make it look easy.
It'll be hell.
Yeah for one second.
Be a group.
I'll try not to.
Out with the old.
Like this place?
It sounds awful.
It sounds just like this place.
What did He say?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
She's got nothing to do with this.
But what do they want?
Right to Hell.
Where is that bus?
What if I forget the words?
We'll always be together.
A thank-you?
A sort of...
Nothing comes out.
Now stop that.
You were only trying to help to give me experience.
Oh my Lord!
I mean nothing really happened.
took a walk.
I'd like to see him down front.
Those people are wonderful!
You watch yourself!
I'm getting experience.
You should get to know 'em.
I have to do this.
Hand 'em over.
We need experience.
get you some experience.
leave this place.
We must do it!
It's the will of God!
You know how much I love this little room.
Well then there's only one thing to do.
She says I should wait.
I want to get in?
Right sure but what's the problem?
You have to help me
When do you hit the big time?
Nice to know you.
So which one are you?
You've been working so hard.
What does she want now?
It's after five.
Come on we're late.
Perhaps we can all use...
I think you were right.
We shall have a serious discussion.
Okay so I just got things started.
But you could build on that.
You and I know that life is not so simple.
A part of what?
But everything that's happening is good!
You can be a part of it!
After how long?
A few weeks?
I have been here thirty years.
And yet it would seem I know nothing.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.
And look if it's about me I mean I'm gone.
I must go where I can be of use.
Well that makes two of us.
In just a couple of days.
You have a phone call.
You sent for me?
Please let me try.
I worked hard with them.
Those women are happy.
And we can get even better.
And what next?
You may stay.
All-time great!
How to put it...
You are correct.
Such as your own for example.
Sometimes it's not enough!
Do you know what those kids are up against?
You should help them!
Those girls were asking questions.
I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.
I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
From all I've heard just about everything.
What's wrong with my life?
If I were you I would use this time to think about my life.
My day's just starting.
What about a phone?
Right sure thing.
You were right the first time.
That's tomorrow!
Is this all the food I get?
Like to who?
Like a guy?
And you'll certainly want to change
But it's almost lunch.
You mean black people?
And all those like you.
Are you talking about me?
It has come to pass.
I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call.
When I was fifteen?
That's my real name!
I'm the good guy.
What is your full name?
Yeah like what?
There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
That's bad news.
It's a big thing for them it's like...
They need you?
That's not the point!
They need me!
I think they'd understand.
We've got to get you out of here '- now!
Most of the time I'm thinking about you.
you've really changed.
I've been thinking about you..
I mean sometimes I feel like...
I mean it..
You should hear them.
They're good.
I've got a show to do.
You'd be dead right now.
Go in and talk to her.
I just need a few more weeks
Nobody knows you're here but me.
We're trying to get a quick court date.
They'll be looking for me!
I totally hate you.
Okay here's what I want.
I know about this stuff.
With room service.
I get the picture!
You'd lose.
And into the street.
Then-you run.
He was good to me...
Who am I supposed to go out with?
Right between the eyes!
Down and out!
The guy was gone!
And get out of here.
Well how do you think I felt?
I used to buy.
On your birthday.
When we were seeing each other.
They call me names.
Where's who?
It's a wonderful world.
They open a window.
Then one day they find you.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
So take it off.
It's done?
You know so much.
We got the one we need!
Yeah right -- when I see it.
So that guy in the bar was right?
She's like...
We've got to save her!
It should be here any minute.
Is it worth it?
It's a beginning.
She told us about one.
I need to see you at once.
But how do we get there?
And what a lovely name.
You're an example to us all.
It's brought people back to the church.
He's kind.
Is that enough experience yet?
As if I could stop you.
To all in need.
Surely there are...
I am very sorry but no.
We both missed.
Ever since we picked her up.
And who are you to talk?
You were nothing.
I must have been out of my mind.
I gave you so much.
What's the thanks I get?
Where's the love?
Can you hold?
Bring her back.
For a talk.
He came to me.
How did you hear this?
Her things are gone.
I did not...
Then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
You must have missed your mark.
When this cut was made this person was already dead.
Would you stay doctor?
I will be in bed.
You will stay at her side?
In time doctor.
I do not care.
Have you seen doctor...
Why did you move the body Doctor?
I was afraid of this.
I am a man of God!
It is only important what you are.
You will not run me out.
No one will believe a word of what you say.
And I will if I must...
Out there for all to hear.
Why not tell us what you have heard?
that might be...
A fine idea.
Maybe you should take this.
You want them...
it shall not take long.
May we look at them now?
but do you have these?
I have everything...
Are you saying it is he?
Taken back to hell.
Will you do this for me?
Very few if any.
Anyone could see.
if I may.
They have children and a good home and good land.
No sir no.
More than enough actually.
At times I do.
No you listen!
Listen to what you say....
so much for common sense.
What is that you wear?
found the body this morning.
are you aware...
You should not worry.
There's nothing left for me here.
You do not know all that has happened.
why are you like this?
To hell with this place and all the people here.
I need time for thinking.
Find her at all costs.
It is nothing.
She comes to read books so her father will not find her.
It is absolutely nothing.
This is as far as she could have gone.
Something I really wish I had not seen.
Never mind it.
What was she doing?
No one yet far as I can tell.
What good is this?
What was taken from them...
Man or woman?
Someone left last night.
But why this place...
Someone only tried to make it look that way.
"" Who knows till we work at it?
What does it mean...
Should we go back?
I hear nothing.
I have others.
All I need is this.
I did not ask you to did I?
he was a good man...
You still need a second to tend to your things.
Face front and wait for me.
Quickly close it.
I will follow...
Say it out and out.
If you think I am behind this say it.
What would you have me believe?
a year from now.
I have not been able to face him yet.
He did not do these things.
If you knew him you would realize...
It was you there?
what are you doing...
they will not pass.
what has happened?
keep where you are.
To thank you.
Why do you follow?
It is only me.
If you want me to go I will.
Do you want me to leave?
but they are here now.
Lord how I hate this place.
two years ago.
What happened to your mother?
why do you ask that?
No actually you were not.
The things I said to you before...
I was wrong to say them.
I have spent every hour in the company of others.
So let me be the first to tell you dear girl...
That I understand.
But what do you want?
Must I hear this?
Why would you do such a thing?
They have done nothing of the sort.
Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
The point being...
May I try?
It would be interesting to find out.
How did you get them?
I have something to show you if you have a moment.
why do you cover your book that way?
And still others believe none of it.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.
Do be a dear and tell me all about it.
It might have been more.
have no great love of...
I'll leave you to your business.
Did they tell?
I think I will...
I know you saw me.
It is fine.
Now, I must...
She has gone out.
You said yourself.
I can show exactly.
I can show you.
Whatever you see, do not move or speak.
I will hold him.
Can you help?
I hear him.
do you know him?
I should tell you...
In a way, yes.
Things I wanted him to see.
Do not move.
No, sir, please...
She did not do it...
You do not want to be here.
Go home to your father.
May I see my mother?
I can go.
You need to come and go as you please.
I believe you did tell me that one before.
Now there's one more thing.
They right about you.
That boy wants me to.
Yeah they's good all right.
We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Okay stop back by.
I'll see you Bill.
Everything's worked out good.
What's got you down this way?
How are you Bill?
Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
I remember it real well.
This is him the one I talked to you about on the phone.
Good to see you Bill.
Been a long time.
My daddy's dead.
He got hit by a train.
Hard to carry too.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
I'll get some of them I reckon.
I like to eat them pretty good.
What do you like to eat here?
What you got that's good to eat?
Did you decide sir?
Well what did you want?
Well it's not too big in here is it?
I feel like listening.
I'm sure you have plenty to tell me.
Was it the boy?
They was a boy.
We made friends.
I like to do the talking.
By the way how was it out there?
Tell me what it was like.
You'll throw him out.
There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch.
It went real good.
You go on back to bed.
That might be better than this.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house.
Done called him.
Or I'll go get him.
Well it's on!
Tell him to get over here.
I'd like him to be here.
I'm not up for it.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
You know what by God?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Now here's the deal.
We'd never have a bad word between us.
And it's my family.
Well I hate you too.
You might want to find out.
No sir's right.
He's real honest.
I thought I told you to keep out!
You mind your own business.
What exactly do you mean by that?
You got that shit right.
Everybody has to work.
I'd better go on home now it's late.
I have to work tomorrow.
I heard you was more than friends.
You seen 'em?
I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Get your shit and get out of here.
You think I'm afraid for you to stay here.
A good deal of it I reckon.
What's all them books?
What's in your bag?
I told you I'll see you later.
Can you go there with us now?
We could just hang out.
Now you better go.
And we're pretty serious.
He gave me a ring.
He's my new friend.
But I feel like I've always known him.
I thought you should meet him.
They're pretty good ones.
I want you to give me your word on it.
Like something different.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can.
We'll always be friends.
I care for you too.
I care for you more than anybody they is.
You're older than him.
You're strong too.
You have to look out for me.
How'd you know to come out here?
I'm old and give out.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
You're strong though.
My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
I know better though.
She said she'd see me later.
Yes sir I reckon it does.
I know you're good.
I wish I would of had him.
He'd be here right now.
That seemed more proper to me I reckon.
A boy or girl?
Right then it was.
So it died when it come out?
My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other.
You know why I want you to play ball with me?
You seem like a brother.
Just like my daddy.
Pull on your works.
You know in a bad way.
You're a good boy.
I bet he will.
Would you go see her with me?
You know that girl I told you about.
The one I love.
Yeah I reckon they did.
You can look at all my books you want to.
I like the way you talk.
I reckon if you want me to.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Well I hate him.
Maybe they needed it.
I thought they was.
Were they bad people?
That's what the letter said.
I thought he took care of us fine.
Why did he do that reckon.
You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
She says it's for the times when he's good to her.
He sure is nice though.
Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here.
He's mean to her.
They'll be plenty of time for the other.
He never did want to.
She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though.
They sell some of everything.
I just come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
You told me to come by.
If you ever want to come by and play.
Well I'll see you later.
Do you like to play football?
I reckon I feel all right.
Are you well?
They told me I was well.
Why'd you live there?
I did live there in the state hospital.
What are all them books?
What's you last name?
But who knows for how long.
The time has to be right that's all.
You go to bed now.
I know he does.
He probably wants to go back and live in Mr.
Yeah he has to go to work in a little while.
Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you.
He just said he'd eat out there.
I've always thought that.
How far did you want to go?
I stay on my feet all the time at work.
Said I was well.
I knew you'd do all right.
Well I just wanted to check on you.
I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
That boy he's my friend.
I'll be.
I told 'em about it.
They know I'm well.
Do they know about you?
That's my first name.
Or set and read me a book somewhere.
No I mean your past.
About why you were in here.
I never was no good with history.
I'll have to tell him about your history.
I know I've seen it myself.
Would you give that a try?
If it was up to me I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted.
He used to go to church with me.
Never did know too much of nobody.
Well you have to learn.
It'll take some time.
You've been let out to do as you please.
I want to come back and stay here.
You better go get 'em.
You better go get your things.
You've been real good to me too.
That's real good of you to say.
You care for him.
You light him up in his eyes I've seen it.
He can play tomorrow.
He wanted to go off and play I reckon.
I got you some.
It's nice out.
They say you're well?
I was about your boy's age.
They say I'm well now from it.
It's not really my business.
Why was it?
Me and him's made friends.
I thought you might like to meet her.
I have to be at work in three hours.
I'll be dog.
Want to sit down?
You take care of that boy.
Well sure okay.
Will you give me your word you'll do it?
You should see all the books he has.
How about before that?
What are you thinking right now?
I see it in his eyes.
When I first saw you I was afraid of you.
In a good way.
Anyway I just want you to know what you're in for.
There's one more thing.
It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital.
I've heard it said that way.
I like men.
I reckon not.
Where do I start.
They're like family.
My own family was never like family.
They're horrible people.
People see us as being different anyway.
Okay I'll come by Mr.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
How long have you been standing here?
Not really to speak of.
Do you have family here?
I reckon Mr.
Why are you here now?
It's been here seventeen years.
Did you live here before or something?
We care about you too.
I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
It's a nice night.
He's been in the state hospital a long time something must be wrong with him.
He just got out of the state hospital.
Did he follow you in here?
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
No we have to get this story.
It's just about twenty miles from here.
I hope you can see to write.
His time's up.
What if he does it again?
He'll only talk to you.
I'll go out and talk to him.
Just period I think.
She told him...
Maybe talk him into it.
Just get me in the room with him.
Well what do we do?
I made myself pretty clear I thought.
I know how that is.
You girls want some coffee?
Is this all of you?
They always talk about it.
Like me too.
Actually I'm his father.
Yes I'm aware of that.
So far there's Mr.
If you accept that would make three of us.
I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
It's coming along.
I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.
actually it might be better if you read the story first.
Call me when you're finished okay?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes.
It was a long time in coming.
I finished my story.
I thought you might want to take a look at it.
A week or ten days and I'll be there.
I'll tell you all about it...
but not here.
It looks worse than it is.
Jesus what happened to you?
Not an easy book.
But not so much when it comes to my work it's true.
Of course what else?
It's just a summer job.
Have you been working there long?
Just like me.
Is he from New York?
Until she was twelve.
Anything in the works?
I'll have the same thing.
What about for you?
And what about for you?
I mean it's a good story.
Yes I suppose I do.
You made her happy.
It was a nice thing you did for her.
I never thought of it that way.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
She probably died.
Once about three or four months later.
Did you ever go back to see her?
So this is the story of how it happened.
Any time you are.
Are we ready?
It just has to be good.
Buy me lunch my friend and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard.
The paper of record.
Or it was until a couple of days ago.
A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story.
Yeah I know but I'm trying to cut down.
You usually get two.
We'd better be.
It's not a long drive.
An hour an hour and a half.
We'll be back in time for dinner.
Where'd you find it?
So what did he say when he called?
It could mean that he got away.
There's something to be said for that I suppose.
They did some number on you.
Yeah well I'm sorry too.
So yeah I'm sorry too.
About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You interested in a job?
I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
What did you have in mind?
Hey man good to see you.
She's in quite a few from that year.
She must have been on her way to work.
They're all the same but each one is different from every other one.
Sometimes the same people sometimes different ones.
But they're all the same.
It's my corner after all.
I'm not sure I get it though.
I mean how did you ever come up with the idea to do this...
It's my project.
What you'd call my life's work.
Seeing as how I've read your books.
It's yours?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.
What'll it be today?
Just name it.
There's just one thing I want to know.
It's all yours baby.
And you're giving it to me?
There's money in here.
I'd never be able to talk her into it.
And even if I could those things cost money.
And what else am I supposed to do?
You told me you wanted to meet him.
This is all I need.
Just cut it out okay?
She looks just like you.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Just get in the car.
Just get in and shut up.
I just need you to come with me.
I've got something to show you.
Nice try old girl.
I'd like to help you out.
Fifteen years ago?
That's the way it goes.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home.
You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place?
Why should I believe you now?
Stop it already.
Just think of it.
Is that what you said?
Like what you're doing.
Go outside and stand in front of the door.
Just between you and I.
Which is more than I can say about some people.
If you really want to know.
And I'm not sorry I did.
You look just awful.
I thought it was about three hundred.
Eighteen and a half years.
Okay my man.
I've got to get moving.
They come in they go out.
It's the law that's buying.
That's what's so beautiful about it.
I try not to anyway.
It's better for your health.
The minute I started thinking about it Mr.
My one true love.
What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Thirteen fourteen years.
I think everything's set.
Just in case something goes wrong.
First name and last name.
What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
So I can get my job back.
And why the hell would you give me money?
What do you care where it comes from?
And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
I'll be back in about an hour.
We'll see what we can work out.
I remember when I was seventeen.
Is that what you are son?
I know what that is.
If it happens it happens.
When I tell you it's open.
It's open when I tell you it's open!
And when do I tell them it's open?
It'll never be finished.
A good choice.
I think I'll take them.
And how much are these?
Jesus had nothing to do with it.
If He'd been involved.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born.
And the poor girl never came back.
He's in trouble all right.
I feel pretty stupid about it now.
What was he doing here in the first place?
And his parents?
As far as I know he went back to his parents.
I just want to know where he is.
Look lady that's enough.
And what was he doing here in the first place?
Is that what he told you his name was?
I know he's been here.
Is that your game?
What do you mean how'd I get in?
How the hell did you get into the building?
That's how we met.
That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends.
Yeah but he's my son.
His name is the same as yours.
That boy's one in a million.
And now I've got me a wife.
And a little boy too.
I'll tell you what happened.
It's a quarter past two now.
You want to work.
I'll give you a job.
It was just a thought.
You've been sitting here all day and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Let me give you some useful information son.
Bye-bye baby!
There's nothing in there now.
And what baby is that?
You can do whatever you want with your own life.
We're thinking of the baby that's all.
Before it's too late.
We're just here to help you.
So what's the time?
You got the time?
Now ask him who his mother was.
Just like yours.
but in my own time.
In my own time...
I really do know them.
They sure did a job on you.
You've got friends now remember?
You'll do it all right.
I'm finished with you.
I'm serious all right.
That's probably better anyway.
He kept saying it over and over....
He never told me about it.
And later on...
well later on...
just when he was about to sell them...
There was a reason.
So you lost the job.
That money is my whole future.
There's no way I'm giving that money back.
It's my money now.
Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
So how much does it come to?
And started to run.
Yeah I picked it up.
I mean there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah it might be.
Is it yours?
Look I'll show you.
It's all in this book.
Pick two or three.
I mean earlier.
No not the end.
If I tell you I might not be able to finish it.
So what's this story you're working on anyway?
Once a story gets hold of you it's hard to let go.
You work too hard you know that?
It was pretty late.
What time did you get to bed last night?
The man has friends.
I mean that's your way of trying to be funny right?
I just happened to be walking by...
One more second and I would have been dead.
It's all so stupid.
There's this guy see.
Sit down in that chair.
She was sick with worry out of her mind.
I want to hear all about it right now.
Cut it out will you?
Just cut it out and come back here.
I bought it.
You know as a little break from your work.
Where did you get that thing?
Hey it's you.
Take good care of yourself okay?
Some extra clothes?
You've been very kind to me...
But all good things have to come to an end right?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
If you want me to leave all you have to do is say so.
It might be worth it.
Look why not make yourself useful?
Take whatever you want.
But it's time for me to get started in here.
Up and out.
I have to work in here.
Is that what you do?
Twelve thirteen years ago.
Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Yeah I can believe it.
My father did.
Believe it or not that little baby is me.
I listen on the radio.
The world is in your head remember?
I'd just as soon not have one anyway.
I'm not ""people.
"" I'm just me.
Not in New York.
The world is in my head.
I've kind of run away from home you see.
It has nothing to do with my parents or money.
That's where the what comes in.
Well maybe just one.
You must eat lunch pretty early.
I've already had lunch.
I'm Paul.
Well if you put it that way...
I just happened to be there.
Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Then again it depends on what you call living.
You only live once right?
Yeah give him another one.
And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
You want another one of these too?
What you want down?
You got no choice on that.
Keep it tonight.
or from the cut on his hand.
What else would there be?
Watch out for him.
When your son came back from the war what did he say about all this?
Wanted to talk to my son.
And when he came home.
Did he write you about this?
Or phone perhaps.
In the war.
Europe I believe.
Their kids was born here.
Went to school.
Like any friend.
Is that your third question?
Just three questions.
Thank you for coming down in this cold weather.
Well what if?
even the right size.
Well it seems to me...
We were afraid.
Even though they should be.
And decided not to.
Up in the air?
Yes and then what was there to call about?
Everything was up in the air.
And then something did.
In case something went wrong.
So five hours.
Plenty of time for a call.
Only a few hours later.
So then you...
and your husband...
Happy for him.
It's not for the.
I think if you hold me just this once I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Not once not ever.
There's no half- way.
We all expect the world to be fair.
It's the face of the people who did that.
We're in bad trouble you have to see that.
I can get you money.
And every night.
We're only talking.
Would be the problem.
Your friends would.
I told myself that was good.
but he found you.
What I'd found.
He was out to make a point.
With that last one.
And the last...?
And the next one...?
to tell Mrs.
Looked exactly like this one.
I'd maybe look for a...
Did you say more?
Your line of work.
Then putting them together.
I'm sorry was there a question in there?
Maybe it went.
Over the side.
He was sorry I got sick.
Just straight to the boat.
We talked for a few hours.
I left at six and went straight to my boat.
You mean this morning.
That's a question sir.
I should have told everything right away.
Actually she said you had decided.
Nobody ever looks.
Just take up space.
You have the night watch?
I better use two.
It's public record.
You said three minutes.
I'll take two.
One for later.
He hit his head.
On the way in.
Still and all.
To cut it down.
Was never found.
So we have to ask...
Well why does it?
That's what Mr.
To my father.
He's looking down.
in the middle of the night.
It's the way it happened I know it is.
Where your hand goes.
This one's new.
You always run with the well open?
And what do you believe?
And it's real.
You want me to say that.
I should show them an American?
how come I never ask.
If you did it.
Or hang back and wait.
White or black?
Your daddy played.
What makes you think I play?
He was heavy but we were real careful.
Why not use that?
You have to wonder.
Does it now?
In the middle.
Of the floor.
Probably one or two hours.
Four at the most.
Can I say something here?
For the third time yes.
For certain no.
Or would both look the same.
I believe I said that.
How does it get there?
Sorry about that Mrs.
Just like you did for Mr.
He had no reason to.
Not having been there with them.
Or could have been.
Not in those words.
So your husband said he's think it over.
Send two more of your old ones up.
only three feet away.
CHURCH                    What about...
I'd like to see some sort of...
and they've always got the job done.
what kind of action have they seen?
I'm not sure I quite get your...
As I said in every way.
Get lost will you?
And that one too.
All right girls - from the top again.
All right girls.
No --- how does it go?
Thank you ever so.
Cut it out girls.
This time of night?
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
All right - so what do we do now?
There you go with that we again.
We'll walk.
It's on the level this time.
We did the right thing with it.
I may throw up.
Who's got time for that?
Did we forget anything?
He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Get it while you're young.
How can you get away with this?
I'll say there is!
I know there's a problem.
You're not doing well.
But you're not a girl.
You're a guy!
You think he's too old for me?
Who's the lucky girl?
Have I got things to tell you!
You'll get them back tomorrow.
Why do I let you talk me into these things?
Come on you can do better than that.
Remember - he's your date for tonight.
Oh he does!
This happens to me all the time in public.
What is it young lady?
We're sitting pretty.
But how long can we keep this up?
How can we?
And I'm not even pretty.
Break it up girls!
Come on help me!
But suppose I lose?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
I'm a girl -
Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
You better come help me.
Now you've done it!
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.
This is just to get out of town.
And it was your idea in the first place.
Like everybody's looking at me.
We'll miss the train.
How can they walk on these things?
At a time like this?
We got to get out of town.
That's not far enough.
But they know us.
As far away as possible.
I think they got me.
Yeah that's what he means.
We're not too late are we?
Boy did it ever!
Yeah - where were you?
Why do I listen to you?
Look stupid he's ten to one.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
I always did.
As a matter of fact it was just the other way around.
You see he needs help.
What do you mean maybe?
He'll be there for sure.
I met one of them.
Oh come on - you can do better than that.
Well I'll come back later.
Oh yes we do!
How about that guy?
Oh please do come.
Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
We better have a drink first.
No - no lights.
You better put on the lights.
I know where to get some.
You got some?
I'm not that sick.
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm a girl I'm a girl I'm a girl -
And you've got cold feet.
And your head is hot.
Stay as long as you'd like.
And that's one of them.
Oh I can think of a million things -
If there's anything I can do for you -
I just think us girls should stick together.
See you around girls.
Especially when I'm blue.
I'm not at all well.
What's the big idea?
I was it.
I thought you said three years.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Where did you girls play before?
This is our manager Mr.
- and you got to be girls.
We could pass for that.
I'm a MAN!
And I can never have children.
And I have a terrible past.
She and I - we' not built the same way.
You know something Mr.
I'll throw up!
I'll walk.
This is where I get off.
You must be quite a girl.
You're not sure?
Just a moment miss -  May I?
That's good thinking.
Oh that's all taken care of.
Just the two of you?
That's the name of it.
Well it is to me.
It's a hundred miles.
And you'll be in all evening?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
- and where were you?
You got to be under twenty-five -
I want to speak to Mr.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.
We got it second-hand.
Yes we're the new girls.
Well here we are.
Talk me out of it.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Yes they're here.
But you have.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Is she young?
As a matter of fact I'm not coming back at all.
Not tomorrow either.
Now about our date for tonight...
Did you have a nice time?
I'm off that stuff - for good.
Let's make it an even million.
I never knew it could be like this.
I'm not quite sure.
You're not giving yourself a chance.
Anything this time?
I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Is that anything?
Have you ever tried American girls?
What else is there for me?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?
You poor poor boy.
I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.
That makes me feel just awful.
I'm trying all the time.
When I'm with girls it does nothing to me.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Oh it's not that.
Now where could they have put it?
What a beautiful fish.
Oh - in here.
We have three like this.
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
I seem to be out of gas.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
If my mother could only see me now -
You heard her - yes.
These came for you.
The most wonderful thing happened -
If it's at all possible -
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Yes you're in the way.
Would you mind moving along please?
Please - no names.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You're society girls?
Do you play the market?
Up up up.
That's very interesting.
I'm not interested at all.
I quite agree.
Which one is yours - the big one?
Your view of what?
Would you mind moving just a little?
Not very likely.
I wish you'd make sure.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Makes a girl think.
I might as well stay in there.
You better go back to bed.
I mean - I'll see.
Well now that you've mentioned it -
About the future.
You know - like a husband?
That's what I'm running away from.
I worked with six different ones in the last two years.
Then why did you take this job?
Put it here.
That's the story of my life.
What's his first name?
And where does he live?
We got different information.
Most important day of my life.
But here it is my big day.
My big day.
He wanted to play with me.
I was fourteen.
I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Do you want to come in for a minute?
We could talk about--
I am so so bad!
Oh shut up and be happy.
Tomorrow will be my day.
And the day after that?
You know what I love about all this?
It was such a long time ago.
Actually I do.
Your dad sent me.
Who did that leave?
Anyway when that boy came over it was the first time you ever did anything without her.
She missed you.
Before Tony you and your sister were best friends.
I was pretty hard on her last night.
It was just after we moved here.
Why should this be any different?
Why with you.
Yeah kind of.
Just take my car.
I had to say something to get you here.
How do you know so much about so much?
And you do now?
Sorry can you give us a moment?
Then there was that one other time.
Well it was a big deal.
As late as...
Or this morning.
I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Well we had a lot of good years but then...
Not for a dog.
Which I do.
You were so good to me.
We were together what five years?
Is that why you brought him?
You know I am sorry.
Seeing you again....
And after all that?
How would you even know if something were real?
Make out with you for free.
I just never said yes.
You paid me for a lot of reasons.
None of it means anything.
You either stay put or you walk away.
But nothing did.
The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
to do that to me?
If something had happened last night...
how could it be?
Is this for last night?
Made out a little.
Talking about it makes me feel better.
And second of all--
what was I...
I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
How did you know that was me?
This happened to you?
I never thought something like this would happen to me.
The women wanted me there for support.
You can understand that.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Six thousand right?
What did he say exactly?
 People do that.
We both wanted the last hot dog?
You have feet?
You want me to let him in?
I wear it.
On my right hand.
Give it back?
You hang onto it or give it back?
Then for once in your life do something for yourself.
Oh well then.
-er than me.
What do you say to that?
What is it you do again?
I am now sir.
Is there any other way to take it?
Means you keep me using my head and that's good!
What do that mean?
And so you did your job right?
Come on tell me...
But where is my daddy!?
But you did all you could David.
What are you looking at out there?
Not now David it's time for bed.
Well how did you like the class David?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
That's where we came from first.
That's where we come from first?
Here it is right here.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
That's right--
And you say all them people is dead now?
That does it...
You keep looking around David.
Let me see it...
I come from way back there.
You getting the point Mrs.
What's that son?
I love you son!
I tell you!
You hear me!
I can do more work in that field than you could in a hundred years!
You just came back home Daddy.
I do hope everything is fine and you will be here.
Give my ""hello"" to your family.
No no I'm all right son...
Thank you Daddy...
You feel alright today Daddy?
They gone to the field...
Come here son...

And me too son!
Where did the sun go to Daddy?
Where was you Daddy?
Do you think he's dead Daddy?
He'll show up one day.

Looks that way son.
When's that?
What's your daddy's name?
Act like one!
What's in there David!?
What's wrong with him David?
So when I left she gave me these books.
Did you find your father?
I know Daddy wants to see him.
You better get back to bed.
Can I go day after tomorrow?
You'll get that woman in trouble!
I'll make him all right.
You sure can son...
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Did you see Daddy?
David come back here!
Children come here...
I'll walk...
Come I'll take you home.
You hear me David!
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Come in children.
It's for the little important man here!
Well let me have it.
He'll tell you all about it.
Come on children...
I just got out here!
I see all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
There you see?
Yeah just stay where you is...
Is there something I can do to help you?
This done happen before.
I feel real up to it right now.
Well let's get to work!
The most important thing is that you're home!
How's the weather out there?
I'll wait till after the children.
You ready to eat?
What we make it to?
I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got.
They are in trouble and you must help them.
I DID IT!!
Like it or not Mr.
Okay I'm finished.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
I hate the environment.
Today children our friend Mr.
What was that?!
Let's run through the plan!!
I saw him last night!
Something must be done!
What the hell is happening?

You'd tell me right?
Soon we hope.
DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
You can go home today.
Help me to help you!
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
We have to change the way you think.
Let's start with you.

The time for action is NOW!!
Something big children.
Children I know ALL there is to know about women.
It's not good children.
Hello there children!!
This is the place--
Yes I am!
I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started.
Then move out of the way.
Get everyone in hell ready.
I could leave him if I wanted to!
He can be nice...
I am your God now.
The General is right.
You boys need help.
We already know what you did.
We saw it on television.
Boys we have to have a difficult discussion.
WE GOT YOU!
It's okay I am done for.
It's so very cold...
Alright back you go.
Let me tell you something about God...
To love each other.
Yeah so what do we say?
I'll just try the first one.
But it has gone far enough!
Change has got to come around!
What has the world come to?
What the hell was that?!
She's Not!
OH MY GOD!!

Those are YOUR children!
Well if it is war they want...
THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

Now GET TO IT!!
You are a bad man!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!!
My mother sent YOU a letter?
It's from your mother.
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Everyone is watching!
You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
You're better seen not hear okay?
You made a deal.
I was just fucking with him!
What if I just left?
Do you remember when you first got here?
We used to talk all night long.
Until the sun came up...
Let's make love.
I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
No I'm being serious!
It has come to be...
Hey come here guy.
He'll never get 'em see?
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell!
Where the hell do you keep it?
Jesus come on!

Something to write home about.
I think we're moving.
Will you two please stop it!
Oh my God what is he doing?
I'm sure I will.
Well it was nice meeting you.
Well so we are.
Of course of course...
Well a little business too.
I am here to provide service to...
to report this.
Oh he did did he?
Where the hell did you come from?
Well shut it off at once!
Look answer my question!
It's a little late for you to be up.
What did you say to me?
Good help is hard to find...
Look we gave you what you asked for.
What more do you want from us!
Save for one.
You better start making sense!
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Yeah yeah yeah give me a minute here.
Can anyone hear me?!
I'm all set.
Well maybe I will.
So are you on for the next one?
You're certain of that?
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Why are you running it again?
Over and out!
That's clear.
Oh you'll get it believe me.
So I'll see you in a few.
Well that's your call.
Just as long as I get my cut.
Yeah I know Bill I came up with the plan remember?
Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Will you shut up already?
What's the use...
Well more power to you.
In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
I can put up with it.
Try not to think about it.
In that case I accept.
It would matter to us.
There's nothing we can do about that.
I never thought this would happen.
And so far.
We have room!
You have to get them out of there!
You have to come with us!
That's you and the others.
Now you know how to get there right?
remember what you said earlier about getting through the wall?
Words to live by.
Do you want some advice?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
You're ready for the real thing?
So we did.
Ready as I'll ever be.
Look I know what I'm doing.
I have experience and training in space walking.
Everyone just stay put.
Even if we do it might be too late.
Yeah let's hope he can find a way through.
Close every door behind you!
Seen one like it before?
it's open.
I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
I'll stick close to you.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Well let me put it this way.
First time in space?
Well if you need anything please feel free to ask me.
Well there's no better to way to see the world than with us.
Is there anything I can help you with?
There's no time to explain.
Get everyone together!
What is happening around here!!!
I want to get out of here!
Baby take it easy.
It's getting too cold in here.
Talk to him...
Talk to him!
How am I supposed to know?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different something to tell all your friends.
Ah hell we can always do that.
It's only been two days!
I tell you something's not right here.
Well what would you know about it?
We're talking about life and death here.
Anything I can do to be of service.
I'll talk to you on this.
one moment please...
I need you to tell it something.
That will not be necessary.
You can simply speak to me.
I need you to actually do something for me.
Right I understand that...
Yes I know all that.
If you need anything please feel free to ask me.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
My father used to say to me ""Never...
What kind of man?
You're not from around here are you?
Can I get you something for the road?
He's my dad.
I'd buy it!
Think he bought it?
How do you turn this thing off?
It makes me sick!
What was that he said...?
Hey you still here?
When you get a chance.
I forget the name.
A beautiful thing.
You know what we got?
And now we got a beautiful thing.
What's on your mind Miles?
So eh you never saw me.
I told you to get lost.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
I'm getting to like it here.
Get him away from me.
What makes you so sure it was me?
I deal with my own shit.
The small ball.
the small ball.
Listen I been thinking about your problem.
But there is something I could do for you.
Watch out for that one.
And believe me she's
I got a right.
You got no right to be here!
You knew her.
You're a hard father to find.
Who gave it to you?
Where'd you get this ball?
She told me about it.
That game was before you was born.
What do you think I can do?
You see what you did?
Take your ball and get out.
My poor baby!
I think you better leave now young man.
We should leave this town.
I looked in his car.
Let everyone in.
I just did it a little too late.
I found dad.
You say who's there.
I say who's there and then you say who who.
You're not playing right.
Who's there!
Someone wants to play with me?
We're having a party for you boy.
Everyone's waiting for you son.
He has a thing about -
Why would you help me?
That my boy is the future.
What if he wants to get out?
Nice set-up.
Now go take out your ""big four"" darling.
What's with the bad air between you two Mr.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.
You're just like you mother!
After we eat Dad.
Just open it.
She hit it Mr.
I get them while they're young.
No no that's too far.
Line up where you want it.
Careful with that one.
He's no father to you.
I need his help.
I'm sick of you people.
Can you change something this big?
My word is good and it'll always be good.
When did I ever give my word to you?
I'm doing what I said I'd do.
What about your word?
You want to find your father?
Back to plan A.
Give me something.
Can I come with you?
He gets into his car.
Are you sure he's dead?
If he's not dead he'll keep coming back.
How do you get this thing down?
What did you say to him?
These open the back door.
Way too late.
I'm afraid I only have five on me.
I could let them go for ten.
More than you could afford.
So why do you stay?
And what do you have to do for him?
Well that was plan A.
It's all I ever wanted to do.
We'll get into that later.
Do I want you?
So what about you?
Actually he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Not at the present.
Not while I'm in training.
Can I ask you something personal?
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town.
What do you want with my dad?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Coming right up.
How do you want it?
You used him!
Where is he!
I should've seen him.
You should probably hit the road.
Open it please.
Do you see it?
Increase positive pressure!
But she's --
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Two and a half days?
They told me about sixty hours.
How long will that be?
What are you -- his mother?
We come down as a team we leave as a team.
Even on earth.
Would you wait a minute?
I said back away.
Back away then.
It shut us down.
He might be listening now.
I think we should be careful.
What am I -- a dog now?
Like you would a dog.
I think he's right.
-- and then brought her down here --
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
She tried again five years ago.
She should've known better.
She was also living with him.
If he wants to be left we'll leave him.
Yes a report.
I told you people nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
He's here somewhere.
Just worry about yourself.
Picked up something?
Nobody's mentioned that in years.
You mean someone actually read it?
We think it might.
There's no such thing...
-- Wait a second --
A thousand feet.
I thought they would have told you on the phone.
What have you been told so far?
The team's already waiting.
In a minute sir.
I need you for this.
They've left keep watching!
Get him out of there.
I thought I told you people --
Everything was normal.
No changes at all.
Well shit -- find something do something...
make something up --
Thank you I can see that.
Try something else.
Working on it now sir.
I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.
I have to tell you.
Man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows.
So how do we get it open?
A break for what?
So do we.
Where it's been.
Give him a chance.
He's speaking our language not the other way around.
I want a name.
A real name.
Get out of there.
You know I never knew that.
Can I stay sir?
See this red here.
But what does it do?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
That it's American?
How would you think it's American?
What do you make of this?
But sitting here we still know.
So how is that possible?
Unless we make ourselves forget.
And I think we already know it will.
Would it work?
I already know too much.
You have to face it.
From your mind.
You're doing it.
Then where's it coming from?
To be walking around.
To be thinking about things.
It's either this...
Believe anything you might say now?
About my problems.
You never really saw what it was did you?
The one that died.
Or was that you?
Yes someone did.
Why go in?
For the power.
What are they doing down here?
Am I afraid of them?
This is quite good.
What do you mean exactly?
You think I'd really drink that?
Oh yes my watch.
What do you mean different?
You're not sorry.
Thirty years ago.
It's an idea.
What if it takes an hour?
Three to six hours.
And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
It's what we are.
He must not realize he is.
But why is he doing it?
Making them real.
But it can.
Brought to life.
""I could never read that far.
You think it's me?
None of this was here before.
I hear they're good.
We were out of food.
I'm coming back.
You should know how it works.
Why should I go?
Maybe you should go.
It's also our only way out of here!
And there's only three of us left now.
Like you say.
Hold it together.
You told him about me?
It's done alright?
It's right here...
He was on the phone.
He told me himself they were taking us back.
He left us down here.
What could have done this?
why are you --
I mean I'm not...
What do you mean -- not normal?
Normally I'd say no.
Yeah it was awful.
A bad one.
It was the only book in there.
Get this thing off me.
For them to bring it up here?
Wait -- down where?
Who says it's a he?
Well they're not mine.
Yes you are...
I'm not --
Just in time for what?
In time for what?
Just in time too.
And now we're talking about a new life form.
You'd have to ask them.
Is it coming from our own computer?
When did it come across?
All of our power.
You mean forget?
Now that I have it on.
How's that working out by the way?
Well press something!
You know how to work this thing?
You got her?
Three fifty-six three fifty-five three --
Two and a half minutes.
Shut up and open the door.
The three of us.
work together through this.
It'll do it for you.
But why would she --?
She's not here?
You're clear.
Have you looked outside?
It'll take a minute.
Getting anywhere with those?
I could never read that far.
I never wanted to.
Then explain it to me.
Tell me about the door.
You were all supposed to leave.
What are you still doing here?
If I had a minute to think maybe but I know you're wrong.
to tell anyone.
I'm completely serious.
I mentioned it in my report.
But on the way home they miss their turn go too far into the past.
They come across this.
Let me get the list out.
Whatever I can do to help.
Look would you --
Wait a second I --
""We are friends"".
Yeah I'll work on it too.
I'll work on it.
You said before right?
From our future.
Someone went to a lot of trouble.
What was that sir?
The others sir?
How are the others?
We're ready to take you home sir.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Told me what?
By the way sir I've read your report.
I think it's brilliant.
This way sir.
Careful it's heavy.
Who's everyone?
Well everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You've heard of me?
Still am really just been a while.
He wants someone to talk to.
He said earlier -- we were his friends --
With what's out there?
Unless it's an act.
Try this one.
Put 'em up to the light.
You mean a picture?
You want me to try?
You need money for the bus?
Keep watching the news.
Are you watching the news?
We'll be back before you are old man.
I hope you can remember everything.
I got you here...
You've got to do the rest.
Then it could be very good.
I'll get the information.
All right then we'll use your plan.
Both of you will have to learn...
You've done very well.
I'm not afraid of anything...
Anything I want!
Now that's interesting.
How much do you think she's talking about?
I'm beginning not to like you.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.
I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own...
Well I've brought you here.
Well now you know...
I would have heard something...
I'd know about it.
You might get your stuff together.
Well we'll see...
Keep it with you always.
You'll have more need of it than I.
Now you must learn to use it.
I am an old man and would be of little help.
See once you let yourself go you can do it.
Let yourself go.
I'll get hit.
Try to feel it.
You mean we should go after her!...
Let your body do your thinking...
You have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think...
but for now let yourself go.
You'll pick it up...
Try to sense what it's telling you.
something horrible has happened.
Keep away I'm fine I'm fine.
How can they hold her?
You'd best forget them.
This is the last place.
One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.
I thought that was just a saying.
It was a black day.
It means you'd better get some rest.
Could I learn to feel it?
But he never told me what it was...
It is my responsibility.
Not any more!
They're probably looking for him...
This is your responsibility!
I'm not at all like my father.
I'd never make it.
He said if I was ever in trouble to come here...
I probably know much more about you than you realize.
In many ways you're a lot like your father.
You saw through me?
Stand up so that we can talk properly.
I'm not that important.
You'd best be moving on before they come back.
Sorry but that was the only way to get you down.
I'd give anything to be in your position.
It's the only way to get into the action...
They're just sitting there!
Yes sir but I can get him...
You're blue five.
It's not under power.
I'll make a report later.
What is your price?
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
There are only three or four left.
Here come six more...
It could be worse...
I'll let you open it then.
I'll be with you in a second.
I thought I'd help.
I've got what I came for.
She'd better be right.
Come back here...
Move out of the way!
Try to get around it.
I'll draw it away.
Is he afraid of the water?
I wonder where they are??
Let's try this way!
Something has happened to them.
Let's try this way...
Well I practice a lot...
But where do we go from here?
We must find them...
I believe in myself...
I'd keep that thing close just in case if I were you...
We can leave as soon as you're ready.
We'd like to talk it over first.
No need everything's under control.
There will be no one to save you this time.
You'll get no information from me.
You have no authority...
There'll be time for that later.
Now let's get out of here.
We've come to get you out of here...
Your father's dead.
If my father were here...
I said we'd see.
Are you there sir?
They're where?
We've had some problems.
I read you sir.
Let him have it.
Well ask him.
Tell him we need five thousand.
Perhaps they might bring something.
What kind of talk is that...
I'm done for.
Can you stand?
Several I think.
There is not much to tell.
Tell me where you've been.
It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
There is nothing anyone can do about it.
not on this system anyway.
As a matter of fact I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Down there on the flats eh?
We'll take this high ground.
He was our teacher...
He was great.
Well maybe you better look again.
It's about who's best...!
are all the same!
What makes you think...
you'll make...
Sir i know it was wrong.
Sir my family...
I wanted to win sir.
Sir no sir.
Sir yes sir.
but like I told you it's a number's game.
I'll take it...
Want the job?
Hope you're ready for more.
Well too bad.
She'd want us to remember her...
I'm eighteen.
Your father will never let you.
How do you make him do that?
You got it bad.
Did you read her mind?
Others are waiting.
Just giving you something to remember me by baby.
I thought I was dead.
How do you feel about him now?
That girl who died on the way up...
Everybody's lost someone by now.
There's a war on.
Everybody hear that?
It looks like an...
IT'S BIG!
WHERE IS IT?
She thinks we're good together.
Hey check it.
When it turned out it was you I made sure we'd run into each other...
Only when I give you an order.
You must be some kind of a hot stick.
Should I call you ""sir""?
Yeah we know each other from the game.
So what are you doing later?
The three of us back together again.
You look so...
No I think something's up.
I thought you were dead!
Life is so different from the way it was.
One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Do you mean it?
Alright I love you.
Try it on for size.
He left this morning.
I'll go for that.
Way to go boy-yo!
He was in the group with me.
Let's never stop...
Everyone's looking...
Are you the boy for me?
You two have so much in common.
No I mean if he can get in maybe I have a chance.
None at all...
I'll meet you outside.
Wait I want to talk to Mr.
How do I know if this is love?
Sometimes I do what I want eh?
What's he got against me...
LET'S GO!
I had no choice but to let him go...
He said you'd understand.
You'll do.
Where'd it come from?
I'm on it!
What kind of name is that?
Well see ya.
no way in.
How come we never got together?
Well anyone who gets you is lucky.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
On one got it?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
This time of the year...?
Oh my what's that?
well we love you son.
We'll all have dinner.
Why did you go and do that?
It's that teacher.
You know the one I mean.
It's not really working out for me here dad.
Well it's just good to hear from you.
What's up son?
I'm telling you you will!
Oh is that how it is?
Have you lost you lost your mind?
This came for you today.
Let's get some air support eh?
That's not your job.
He was a teacher  kind of a know it all...
You want the job?
Sir yes it is sir.
Sir thank you sir!
No talking please.
I've been so stupid...
Well yeah sure...
Well that's what you're saying!
You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now!
Wait you two.
I'll take the first group.
Move it all down -
You can have everything else eh?
This would be mine sir.
Not with an officer no sir.
This is the part that's best for both of us.
You can never be sure.
She's my girl.
SHUT UP SIR!
We need pick up now!
Give'em hell sir!
Get on the boat NOW!
Get on the boat...
Everything you got!
Who's that with you?
Never pass up a good thing eh?
Want some now?
You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
What would you do if you were me?
Go find out.
Well it's not really my job to please.
But do you understand it?
To join with him.
Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
I'd like to go along...
will actually save Earth.
But it's the only game in town.
The question is Mr.
It's taken control of the computer...!
That thing is twenty hours from Earth.
We know nothing about it yet.
Yes sir I'll do that.
I'm aware of that sir.
Well sir it looks like you found a way.
I'm sorry Will.
May I ask Why?
You are what...?
This is what I want.
We have twenty-one minutes.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
To keep away.
If I'd seen you again would you have been able to say it?
That you left?
Was he difficult?
That was the order Mr.
See that it is.
Take me over please.
There's no way to know.
Not for us?
Is there not more?
What should you have known?
Were you right?
might all be there.
For me too.
I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Could you make out any plan anything to do with Earth?
I want him here.
Report to me.
To you sir?
Aye we understand that sir!
We're doing our best.
You bet your life.
Sure plan to.
Would you tell me about it?
I'll wait for you...
you think that's right...
But that's what happened.
Right here in the office.
the better to eat me with your dear?
and we could get up every morning...
Now you're talking...
We could live up here live up in the country.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
People might be better off.
They thought about it spent the evening back in the...
You know what else a man can do?
That's something a man could do...?
Did as of last week.
Press still works.
One of the few things money can buy.
what is this...?
No that's true.
I told them what you said...
He goes up to her.
""What happened to the horse?
"" She looks at him.
She takes his hand...
They meet on Main Street.
Her horse has just died.
He's coming from the fire.
Time for a change.
I do if you do.
Then I'll come back then.
Then I'll come back at a better time.
What would be a better time?
The other side.
Read the card.
Just leave it outside.
Would you go in...
Who is it...?
Want to do the other part?
Never saw the point of 'em.
You like kids?
I lost the...
What are you doing down there?
I thought you had Play Practice.
That's very important.
Tonight tonight I...
I have play practice...
Do you know you could...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance do you see?
But how do I...
it's about getting a second chance.
They decided I decided to to...
You love what?
get down to the station.
It was lovely meeting...
I always thought so...
do you think we might...
That's a fine house.
You look at that and you know there's nice people that live there.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
That: in an act of...
No no I see...
But but but but...
do you see?
You get what you pay for.
No of course you want to get out of town.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
It's about life.
You like my play.
It's in your play.
That's really good.
If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
You wrote a play on it what play is that?
Other one has history too.
I wrote my play on it.
Better than new.
It has some history.
I have one but they lost it.
Yep you came to the right place.
As soon as it does.
Who is this person that you've found?
what are you...
it's all over between us?
It's all over between us.
I've found someone else.
What did you say...?
I've found someone else and it's very serious and it's the end.
I have to tell you something...
We had a date.
Do you know what they...
That's so beautiful...
What what what are you doing here?
And I might have something important to tell you...
But after Play Practice I'm yours.
We on for tomorrow night?
This is Big Business in which our Life...
Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
You know your lines...?
And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times.
What're you doing here...?

Now is it a good play?
We'll work it out...
Hope to tell you.
Big day last night.
He had a hard day.
Well where do they hold court?
And I need a drink.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
How big is this horse?
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.
Fourteen year old girls.
Now: I'm looking at the...

That Could Be.
They think it's your First Wife...
Heard your wife's having a baby.
Stay by yourself in your room.
I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Nobody knows it but us.
Are we together on this?
What are you doing this evening...?
You got to get out of here...
Are you all right...?
not if you've got something to hold on to.
Nice town that you've got here.
Sure, what have you got?
Way of the world.

Just him and me.

You bet he did.
He saw the girl in the car...
Who's White...?

No but we're planning to.
I'm very sorry I...
Call us back.
Then you're finished in show business.
The girl was in the car.
As he should.
to our community you understand...?
To our world.
And be part of your world.
And you stick with me.
You are a part of this world.
That's the bottom line.
You've got to help the side.
What a find you are.
Get some for everybody.
what do you like to drink...?
The best or not.
I want to make a good film.
That's why we're here...
We need it tonight.
Yeah you were saying...?
We're out of money.
You told me you were writing.
I was walking down the street...
I remember I was writing a...
How do you know you saw it?
What did you say to them...?
How do they know that you told them?
I can write it.
My oh my.
You tell me what to do I'll do it.
You've got nothing and you know it.
By God you know it.
You need a...
Now we all have...
yes give her that part in the film.
Yes we'd love to have you...
This is a hard time for you.
Would you tell the guy get the A.
No just the...
It comes out of our end.
JUST GET ME THE MONEY.
NO NO NO NO NO PAY HER OFF.
DID YOU HEAR ME?
Pay her off.
What does the woman want from life...?
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
I got a company...
Find the money.
Type it up and get it back to me in...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I left that for you.
I want them gone.
Dear this is Mr.
I've got two days to get this house...
Where the hell have you been...?
This is your party and whatever...
So we just got lucky.
Well these things happen.
George that is so kind of you.
We meet Friday and I...
the city council...
The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
not at all...
That's very kind of...
Bet you did.
I read for that part.
Did pretty good too.
Drive a man to drink.
Took me near half an hour get across the street yesterday.
Yes I hear it.
We have to lose the window.
I have to work on my video project!
I can put myself to bed.
I'll miss you so much.
Where we all go.
Now how can that be bad.
Are you afraid for me?
Until he's old enough to read.
Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
I got to see you.
You talk like the big girl you are.
About what you feel.
So here's what we do.
He's not even there.
I could only help him.
I could help with the debate.
Like a big sister.
I hope it's the right kind.
Who's that for?
So she'll see the good side of us.
But we do have a choice.
To make it better.
Daddy and I tried hard.
We really did.
Why should I care?
Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.
Nobody even asked me if I like her.
And he wants to talk.
I like talking about it.
So why are you asking me?
why do you think?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
In the same country.
What did you think that was about?
That's one time always is always.
You can call him after dinner but...
Never say never you always say that.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Why would I want that to happen?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Why would I say that?
Those were all words.
I hate when you say that.
Use your words.
In high school.
But it's real.
Does he have an older brother?
But they stand out a little.
Help me here...
Not use my words please!
Now just this once...
It's just for play.
help a friend with this...
And she called me.
Now could she just...
It starts at seven!
And this is my room so get out!
This is my house too!
This is my daddy's house --
But when you're at this house --
Thank God for that!
You're not my mother.
I'm sorry okay?
I'm almost done making it.
I'll just eat my lunch.
Does he look lost to you?
Few can carry it off.
Help me find your brother.
She wanted you to have a daddy to love.
There's worse things.
I really hate her.
IS THAT YOU?
I held you...
take it man...
You can talk him into anything!
for Christmas okay?
Just like your dad.
It's the good kind.
I'm out the door...
That is so not funny.
You're really late.
It's not good enough.
You'll know.
Can I talk to you?
When you're there.
But you can still see him.
Is he the same guy?
These are good.
She does this twenty times a day.
I have to get there.
In the still...
I'm still sick but I'm better.
So you're okay.
Is your bad?
We never find out.
Thursday's fine...
But you know what.
I'm somewhere thinking of you.
It's a country.
If you want me to hate her I will.
if you like big hair...
They work very hard.
Which means the most important job.
I knew where I was all the time.
You're happy now.
They'll always hate you.
And when did that pass?
You really need to.
Why would his worry?
Or my children's worry.
Or anyone's worry.
Help the sit...
Have you still never told him?
More and more.
to pick up the children.
Now go back and FINISH!
My work is everything to me.
This'll never happen again.
Only forty minutes late.
What happens next?
Walk in the park.
If it were you.
You want us to take him tonight?
In fifty years the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
And we all went through that together?
We should tell them together.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
WE are over.
To make it easier for them or you?
I'd like you to be there.
Just not to me.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?
The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Getting so beautiful...
she looks more like you every day.
I've really given this a lot of thought.
A great deal of thought...
And I'm supposed to care.
I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
He could have been...
You're WHERE?
that way you'll be there and I'll pick up Monday Tuesday and Wednesday.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'll call from work.
We can have a conference call.
It's Wednesday night.
She's at my house.
But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
There is no move.
Planning on getting --
Just sit me up.
You know there's nothing you have to say.
For a few minutes.
I have their past.
You'll learn.
With good reason.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
And I have looked down the road.
At what my life will be.
But there is more to life than even love...
You've turned her into you.
And I may not get another chance.
To turn her back.
God help me what have I done.
And she will look back on this.
And remember how good it felt.
How easy it was.
Right down to the ground.
Give 'em my number.
That thing you said before.
My advice to you?
You have to think long term.
I made the choice that was right for me.
And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
It's the same choice you made.
You mean after I'm dead?
It was just a job there'll be plenty of others.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
go to the park.
Can I talk to her?
Thanks but it's under control.
Can I say one thing?
Eat your heart out.
What it's all about.
You look sick.
But you look...
I really look like shit.
That's my project when I get back.
And you said...?
I had kids of my own once.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
See I know that.
How the hell would you know?
You bet you are.
Life's a trade-off.
By what right?
I got used to...
thinking of them.
my kids too.
it's my problem too.
Did I hear the word...
But I came here to...
You're taking the kids.
It may not happen.
Hey any help you need we'll cover.
On a part-time basis.
Plus I've got things on my mind.
I'm sorry I just...
It's okay it's twenty minutes.
The horse'll be there.
I need someone to take them to the park.
I did it for her.
Of every night.
And every day.
I need practice.
You've seen to that.
Do you HEAR that?
That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
To break a child's heart.
You got to hell!
I have a life!
You mean for you.
I was in there in him.
Look I want to talk to you about...
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
I got it right here...
How do you hold down a job?
We do the best we can.
Is only a hope.
That's not us.
What a difficult woman.
' That's what I said.
When I think of playing that out every day for the rest of my life...
Let me put it this way.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Their friends are here.
'  Did it go like that?
But she said...
I needed some time away.
So what's for dinner?
Well they will be.
Just like to make sure.
That your past.
And my future.
Are real different.
They're my kids.
You could make us something?
What's eight ten years?
The kids and I...
Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
I think so too...
We have the kids.
Jesus what did you see in her?
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
I know they hate me.
But 'em a dog or something.
But you're not good at this.
you're working...
Anyway I thought...
while I'm gone...
We have the kids this weekend so...
So I'll have to order in?
I might not be back until Saturday.
I'm doing it behind her back.
Do I know any...
Man I am out of here!
You heard me: leave the table!
Leave the table!
There's something I need to talk about with you.
But that could've happened to him.
Well he did.
With his family.
What do you want to do for me?
Well I was thinking...
I might work for you.
What's in your future?
Great to be here.
Nice to have you here.
Well all right!
Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Well then when you get older you can do something about it.
And then you do something about it.
But really you never know.
Jesus was not bad.
Who is Jesus?
But it's not like real work.
This is work.
But when you're not.
What do you like to do?
I'm always working.
But like what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm still poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
We had to work.
My family was poor.
I did not go to high school.
What did you do in high school?
But do you really believe in God?
It was God's will.
Why did your parents have so many children?
Maybe they'll like it.
We're not ready!
We're not ready.
We really have a long way to go.
Will you tell me what's funny about that?
This is definitely better.
Well it's still just a beginning.
I know I can...
I love them!
I like these people.
Well I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.
It's funny I suppose.
Come in bed with us.
Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
It's all about who you know.
You know you have to.
We used pull.
What's tomorrow?
Ready for tomorrow?
We would have been...
How was the class?
We did the same thing last year also.
Was anyone in my room today?
And he's so...
I knew it was shit.
You'll write something better next time!
Your story was terrible!
You've become kind.
You've lost interest...
You'll read it in class tomorrow.
Anyway I have to go.
I think you should leave it the way it was.
I think it's better.
You mean again?
I can read it to you.
Hey you want to hear my short story now?
But what kind of pull did you have?
Oh I know I know that.
Man it's just like conversation.
Same as what?
What DO you know?
What's not to know?
I was just trying to make you feel better.
It's a very fine line.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Take off your top.
It's a really nice place you have.
It's over there.
Thank you for being honest.
It is a piece of shit.
I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Can I join you?
Well now you have.
Maybe have a talk show or something.
Tell me what you're thinking.
as a friend: what do you want to do with your life?
Do you mind if I call you back?
Eight six and four.
How old are they?
But not any more.
so anyway tell me.
But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Well but it was so long ago.
We were so different back then...
Anything I might have seen?
So then what do you do now?
I mean really it's finished.
Anything I might know about?
Yeah well then it got me writing so that was a good thing.
Oh that's too bad.
Well I went to law school if you can believe that.
Oh no not any more.
And it was time to move on.
I mean did you ever think we would actually make it?
Oh yeah well...
How'd you get it?
I'm so so sorry...
I'd like to be good at something.
What is most important to you?
Can I see what you have so far?
So where'd you get in?
I mean I had to.
Yeah well it's possible they would be interested in it.
Well I-I hope that--that--
Twenty-five-million!
They can get in now man!
Is he with the girl?
Well get someone down there!
We got trouble.
They could be anywhere now.
Taking the fire.
If we go out together we're all dead!
you think with your heart.
You should listen your old man more often.
Let's move it we got company!
We'll be out in no time.
It's nothing to worry about.
How well do you know this place?
Yes you should.
you think I should thank you.
I know you're not too happy at this point.
It's all been taken care of.
If you gave me a reason to...
She's as good as gone...
He's in there...
How much do they have?
We were under government contract!
So what are we looking at White?
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I can have the money there in an hour.
Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Get your men to do it!
Why should I worry?
Agreed--let's move it.
I say we head out.
How much of this shit do they have White!!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
I know nothing of the sort!
It was cheap.
Where is this...
You can have it back when you leave.
If he's not there try...
Possibly some coffee?
See I told you.
It's not a he General.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Give that back to me.
Who the hell do you think you are sir???
What are you talking about Major?
I think that just might be it!
How much would the call be station-to-station?...
He'll want to talk to me.
What about the President?
But look there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.
Maybe it'll work?
I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Maybe it's too late.
They told me Major.
What happened Major?
What is your name young lady?
Well that's the funny part of it too sir.
What did you say sir?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Just a second sir.
That certainly would be a problem sir.
You see you knew the answer all the time General.
To you sir.
But how do I know?
I just thought of something sir.
How do I know I'm talking to you now?
With or without my say-so.
Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Let me worry about that Major.
Major that's all I've been told.
Just got it on the red phone.
You have a right to know.
All right Major.
Why do you think I ask?
Why do you ask sir?
Major I happen to believe in a life after this one so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.
And you'd like to see that?
I'll tell you what I do think.
Well I'm not sir.
Major you're talking like one of them!
Well for the same reasons we do sir.
Go on Major.
What if they start something?
Well sir like I said for the same reasons we do.
But so do we.
Not yet Major.
I know so Major.
That's close enough Major.
I'm trying to sir.
When he said it fifty years ago he might have been right.
Do you follow me Major?
I mean why do you want to start the war?
Ask away Major.
What shall we drink to sir?
Thank you Major.
That about right?
I suppose they are sir.
There's nothing anyone can do about it now.
And help yourself to whatever you like.
that would be an awful thing to do sir.
Suppose that were the case?
Why else would you think I'd do it?
And if that were true?
That's a good question Major.
Maybe if you think hard you can think of the answer yourself.
That is correct Major.
You're a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
General can I ask a question?
Oh it's not my radio sir.
I see you're playing your radio Major.
That's right Major.
He has one hell of a chance.
General stick to the point please.
Well just common sense sir.
Hello are you still there?...
We're still working this thing out.
Look he's there and you're here.
But I believe it was four.
I believe it will be just a few minutes at the most.
They're coming in now.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.
And if he just looks out of that window he'll see everything we're doing.
One-three-eight.
Sure I'll take her up right now.
Sure I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Could you take her up to about eight hundred?
Hang on boys.
I think they mean business.
He's sitting two feet away from me!
Might even help.
Thirty-five still straight.
Call them every five miles.
They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
It can happen to the best of us.
Then this is it.
Where'd they get you?
Listen I think I'm hit bad.
Check these points.
Yeah it sure looks like the real thing all right.
No this looks like the real thing.
That's what I'm doing and it comes out the same.
That's exactly what it says.
Well I just wanted you to know how I felt.
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
We're on course Major.
Well it would probably help if you took it...
There's no other way boys.
the hard way.
But I get a red light.
Then get off my back!
I said that's the point!
Like hell it does.
Look this is different.
How the hell do I know?
Maybe the war's over.
Why should they call us back?
No one else would know it.
Wait a minute Major.
Where would they get that?
He's dead all right.
Hell he looks dead.
In the back...
Sure I'm on my way.
Now will you shut up and get up here???
About five minutes.
I was just trying to think the thing through.
Well if there's a war they must have hit us first.
Certainly not sir.
It would not be difficult.
Nobody's really different even if they think they're different.
He's not free.
He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Well what it was...
And I got out and I just started walking.
And now I just have to go once a week.
How long were you in there?
I have to go once a week.
Sure all the time in Group.
Did you ever hear that saying ""This too shall pass""?
Can I have some?
She told him to meet us here.
Do you think it's a good idea?
I stand for something.
Was it okay?
That was really great.
Okay whatever you want.
But I'll go back.
Hey what are you doing now?
Oh no it's not.
Oh some of 'em.
No I you know I help 'em out.
I wish I could see it.
It looks excellent on tape.
The video is like my head and and everything you know is like is like in there that I see.
Well what's it on?
It's really not about anything.
Hey you said you did a video?
Yeah when's he coming?
Yeah we all want to see him.
So when's he coming?
I mean did she talk to him?
Definitely not dead!
Let's go look then.
Let's go look then!
We has a great time together.
What they're looking for her?
Yeah that's what I'm trying to tell you.
No shut up!
But I'd I'd do it for free.
Could you just-
But that's a plus.
It was party time.
Really nice guy.
We talked about the video.
Wait wait wait wait.
I feel really bad about that but I was busy you know I mean...
You're my friend she's your old lady.
Hey you know me.

Well that's one way of putting it.
And your like what else?

Oh you were there?
Will you stand up for me?
Okay come on.
Taking care of business.
This kind of thing happens.
It's just never happened to me.
It's true though.
I'm not a nice guy.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
We could still talk you know?
It's nice to talk.
I mean what is there to be happy about really?
Sometimes I just want something different you know?
I had to get out.
So I just wanted something different in my life.
Now how the hell would you know what I think?
What'd he get you?
You got everything right but the car.
And you love him a lot.
Thinks he is.

He was here earlier.
Always two-fifty my friend.
They go up?
Come up here!

Just put it down.
They're just people.
You know like they even have a right.
Let me tell you something I was born here.
I'm an American.
Look they took it from me.
Why why did you start this in the first place man?
Just go home alright?
What are what are you doing?
I think they did.
Makes me sick.
I I hope he does.
You know and what are you doing here in the first place man?
You did that for me?
That's not the way it is at all.
You want to believe so bad you'll buy anything.
Yeah of course they let me out.
So did I call it or did I call it?
Go look man.
You hit her?
Oh wait wait a minute.
Why'd you hit her?

Oh man I really...
I'm not I'm not talking about this.
This is no big deal you know?
I can come down and and get you out.
No no say it like this.
So they'll talk and talk.
They'll probably talk all night.
By six a.
There's really only one answer.
Yeah no you're right.
It's no big deal you know.
No wait no I thought about New York.
No that's not what I'm saying.
So you do you want us to leave?
No well I have.
It's true there's no you know law no order.
Yeah well he's from a Third World country.
You know what I mean though?
Okay look my wife called the police.

You know this what you're doing with your life...
Why we're just standing here.
I gave it to you.
Wait no I...
You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
No maybe not though.
That that's what I'm trying to say.
Well what about us?
What what are you saying?
I've run out of words.
Away away away.
Is that alright with you?
Maybe you want to think about it.
No no I have to talk to you.
No look when when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Hey where did you go?
What's wrong with here?
Why is somewhere else better?
My job is not who I am.
No no see that's not what I'm saying.
I could go to New York if I wanted to but what's the point?
Look at those kids there.
I would've done something.
This place is so stupid.
I would've stopped it.
Okay what would you have done.
Okay but nothing happened.
It got that close.
It was just something that got out of hand.
Well you know he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Can I talk?
You know all you know is what's good for you.
Can I talk here?
Let me talk.
What do you stand for?
Yes I stand for -
But do you stand for anything?
About things that are important to me.
Make people think for a change.
It's an honest question.
So you can give me more shit?
Might as well not do anything!
Oh well then you better listen to him.
I think he knows.
"" Listen to you.
Your sure as hell right about that.
It's a piece.
No not not everything.
I am the man in your life.
Was that supposed to be me?
Okay so maybe later.
I know I know I know.
You could've come over.
No place like it.
Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
George can drive us.
There's plenty of room in the car.
Look man it...
I mean food?
No you know what?
It's not you man.
It's not anybody.
Oh no man look.
Look you know it's me okay?
I I really...
Hey it's you man.
It's you know what you know what it is?
Why are you so special?
Yeah well that's what I do too.
It's easier.
Yeah maybe later.
You should show 'em to me.
So you think I should?
No man I mean it.
You know I've thought about that actually.
But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff.
I've been doing some writing though.
Short pieces you know.
So how's college?
Oh man we were pretty on tonight.
The road's hell you know?
It's hard work you know?
Yeah the record company they make me use it you know.
I mean nothing's changed.
It's your fucking problem.
This was not my responsibility.
No this has everything to do with you.
I hope you're happy!
Look; okay come on.
Look what are you doing?
Look that's enough.
My wife called the police.
We were waiting for you.
They love you just about as much as I do.
You know I'll call the police.
That's the fucking problem.
You know why do you call me names?
I'm only working here.
Well what about this?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
What else does your mother say?
Yeah I know what you're saying.
Or the future oh no no I mean...
Yeah you know when you called I thought there's a name from the past.
Yeah I have I have yeah.
I think about you.
I mean a lot.
Yeah but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place you know?
I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
I hate it here.
You got out of here you know?
I'm ready to go.
You know I'm really sorry if I if I said something wrong.
I'm sorry you know?
Alright alright already.
Oh no man.
Yeah come on play it.
And you know why it's so good?
It's simple you know.
Oh man I feel so good.
Oh God that would be something I really want to do.
Would I get paid?
It's in my contract.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
You do not want me to do your cover.
Yeah you know I'm thinking of moving to New York.
It's you know...
No she was just sitting there?!
Like you you know head's in a good place you know?
Look at this car man!
It's on me okay?
Well just you know have 'em call me.
If you hit me...
Oh okay it's none of my business.
You know man it's none of your business what I do okay?
You know there's a life on the road?
Watch your fucking language alright?
Or I might have to.
What did she say exactly?
About where she went.
I mean what bar?
Well what'd she say?
I'm sure she's alright.
She said she might go get a drink first.
There's just no answer.
Oh How'd she get back?
You seen her?
So like your dad's a big deal right?
Hey great game Friday.
Oh that's nice for you.
He wants to have ideas too.
Can we go please?
Make a move.
Saw the world you know?
It's a great idea.
You should go to New York.
Go show 'em.
This is great - GREAT!
Better enjoy it now.
I'm in too.
It's off...
I've got to get that.
Why would I go to the police?
She thinks you went to the police.
Of course - of course!
It's a sure bet.
I know but that was before.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Will it ever end?!
I love this lady!
I sure do.
We want a hand-up.
Let me explain something...
Just call me later.
Hold on now.
What do we do before a big game?
We all wanted to do this - for you...
I'm sorry I ever started this...
He is the Great One...
I'll just ask the question myself...
Sounds more like the first.
Well I want to know what happened --
The deal is fifteen hundred.
Well we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.
Five should do it.
Or I could get my own horse...
You want us to help you pick up?
But no matter what, she held her head high and said...
"" The great one...
Are you girls talking about boys?
Is that you down there?
Maybe we can make a deal.
She did, did she?
How is the old girl?
I'm not first!
Hold up hold up.
So you need my help?
I know - that's what I said too.
Now how the hell can I help you?
So could half the women in here.
And I'd rather go out with a nice can...
If one of us needs something we all do.
She got to be.
What can I say to her?
I could be her father.
I've got to run along.
I'm sorry about New Year's.
Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
This is the woman I love.
I mean could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Sure this'll go on all night.
Where's the bar?
That was the general idea.
He wrote it.
I like it that way.
Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
All my things?
I've never been in this house...
Get your things together.
A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.
Can you figure it out yourself?
Why did she call me?
This is where you live?
Is it something awful?
Of course I love him.
I'm just not in love with him any more.
That's what you've always wanted.
Let's face it what- ever it is.
What is it you've heard.
What's wrong with you tonight?
Hey what's the matter...
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.
I come from a picture family.
Look at this street.
I like it better than any street in the world.
It's from a friend of mine.
Who's who?
I'm happy here honest I am.
It'll play.
What's good about it?
Came  on back.
Nobody can be that busy.
I'm free every evening every week- end.
If you want we could work at your place.
You've got yourself the best guy in town.
We'll have to do it together.
It's your baby now.
I'll make it short.
The first time they meet...
See if they make sense.
What about all those ideas you had?
You know I'd take you up on that in a minute.
I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Why should you do that?
It's no good to me anyway.
You sure have.
I want to write.
As a matter of fact.
I tell you this is half sold.
Where's the story?
He thinks it could be made into something.
What's the wonderful news?
You were not there.
They never heard of you.
I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Life can be beautiful!
You'll be waiting for me?
We must be strong.
I've got some ideas myself.
How about living it up a little?
I've got a few ideas.
Want me to start right now?
Maybe there's some paper around.
Here's some- thing really worth while.
Who wants true?
Who wants moving?
Maybe that's why it's good.
It's true it's moving.
I had a teacher like that once.
How did you like it?
There's one called....
something with a window.
Where's the phone?
That was last year.
If I could be of any help...
Everything will be fine.
The old team together.
Did you see them?
Did you see how they came?
I'm pretty busy as you can see...
You'd better.
Lots of people were.
I just want to work again.
It's got a lot of good things.
Of course it would be an expensive picture...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
We've missed you too dear.
I had no idea how I'd missed it.
You're a woman of fifty.
They want me they want me!
I get letters every day!
None of us has had the heart.
They still want me!
Now face it.
These are nothing.
You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.
What is it you want -- money?
You took the car.
I went for a walk.
I just happen to know it.
I think I'll read a little.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I just came to say good night.
Keep your eyes on the book.
He must be quite a guy.
Of course he has to finish this picture first but mine will be his next.
Thank you darling.
It's your show.
He's trying to get my price down.
Give me this.
Now close your eyes.
Nothing is the matter.
I'm having a great time.
Show me some more.
What's the matter with you darling?
Where are your...?
What on earth darling?
It took you hours.
You're a darling.
I'll get you some.
They're awful.
Have one of mine.
So he said it quite a few years ago.
I never looked better in my life.
This is the right day.
I'll do it again I'll do it again I'll do it again!
You've been good to me.
Go to that girl of yours.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you.
Do you want me to tell you?
Cut out that us business.
What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
You've bought me enough.
I've been in love with you all along.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
You think this is all very funny.
This is for you and me.
It's a quarter past ten.
What time are they supposed to get here?
Where are your evening clothes?
How about some evening clothes?
The very best...
Well go there!
What's wrong with It?
Now you're being silly.
We have a car.
All hand-made.
It is to me.
That's why I came to this house.
and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
I've lost my car.
Now what is it?
I need some money right now.
They've come for my car.
Not now my dear.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Cut away from me?
Suppose you make up your mind.
It's all paid for.
It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
I'll come early tomorrow.
You can stay here.
There sure is.
There's something wrong with your car you said.
It's getting kind of late --
You'll have to finish it here.
You know I'm pretty expensive.
I get five hundred a week.
I want you to do this work.
You can find somebody.
I can say anything I want with my eyes.
That's what makes it great.
I wrote that with my heart.
They will love it every place.
What a part!
I hate that word.
This is to be a very important picture.
I have written it myself.
Took me years.
I ought to have it taken out.
Just a minute you!
Writing words words!
And who have they got now?
They're finished.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
I am big.
You used to be big.
I had some trouble with my car.
you've got the wrong man.
How much will it be?
She never will.
That is my job.
It has been for a long time.
Will that do it?
I had the upstairs.
Right with you.
She is upstairs.
I'd better press your evening clothes sir.
You send them.
She got enough out of it.
We have to be very careful.
We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
Hey what's this with the door?
It was the room of the husband.
That's what I told them.
Some men are here.
They asked for you.
Who said you could?
Who asked you to?
Is that so!
I brought them myself.
My clothes and things are up in the room.
You did sir.
You are too young.
It will never make house Beautiful.
for one night.
This room has not been used for a long time.
I made your bed this afternoon.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Look maybe I'd better take my car --
Go on in.
Sure we believe you only now we want you to believe us.
Had to get away for his health I suppose.
Is that So?
We've come for the car.
Along is no good.
I need it now.
If something should come along -
You trying to be funny?
You've got five minutes.
What's your story about?
What do you think I've been doing?
Now you'll have to write.
It's the car I'm talking about.
How's that about your being my friend?
And let's have the car right outside.
Did you hate him?
Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Did he have a wife?
Did he had a girl friend?
Did you know them?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?
Had there been any trouble between you before?
Just answer me that.
Say that I'm busy and hang up.
Certainly it's important.
It's important enough for Mr.
It is not Mr.
He says it's very important.
I want you to get out the car.
Bring something to drink.
I must go explain to them...
But what will happen?
The city will have to make do with three.
My work comes first.
Other people come second.
I want to do something new.
What do you mean we?
That little girl?
Whatever I say.
I think I'd better keep it.
That moment is now!
For the right moment.
Why did she have to show up now?
In about five minutes.
If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
But which one?
It must be the girls.
One of the girls.
It must be near.
She can have it.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Turn it against her.
And you can see how you feel about me right?
That's what I came: to find!
She'll forget about us eventually.
You're a good-looking girl.
And I'm--- available.
Are you asking me for a ""date""?
And maybe something might.
What I had before.
What's not there now.
I miss it.
It seemed that way to me.
That makes it worse.
I sort of like what you said.
But I have to go back.
We could be very happy here.
Is this how?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
Of course not but...
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
What do you feel about me?
You hate me?
All this talk about love it's silly.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you.
Love changes everything.
But be reasonable.
She's bad news.
Tell me where I can find her.
Let's talk about us not her.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
I know just the place.
We have to have a long talk about all this.
That woman who's after me.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Can you get us out?
That one was for you.
I'm ready for her.
You seem afraid.
They want me.
You've been without water for a whole day.
Go on  talk big!
If that worked you would've done it already.
No you want me to drink it of my own free will.
Come back to my house.
My car's outside.
This is your problem right here.
I have Power.
I always get what I want.
Forget her you're mine.
I saw you first.
Yes yes I saw the whole thing.
In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Why should I believe you?
This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off.
And you think you're in love.
Oh no not you again.
Well just one.
Like a fire.
I bet they do.
People seem to like my service.
Come in have a drink we'll talk.
Well there's several ways to go.
Maybe we can have lunch.
I've got things to do.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Better eat it quick.
Man that looks too pretty to eat.
It's no trouble.
I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Oh no thanks.
You mean we could've been...
you-know-what...
all this time?
I've been in love with you for years.
Not for one minute.
I mean you were there.
He may be dead.
Wait till you're older.
Here -- watch this.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes.
Where is Earth?
It's something they have on Earth.
What are you making:
I'll get a new one with the insurance money.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Your hair looks the same.
But what for?
She's out to get you.
Did you have a fire at your house or something?
This is all your clothes?
Thank you both so much.
It was a lovely lunch Mrs.
I had a wonderful time.
I'm so sorry about your parents.
We'll try to make you happy here.
You ought to take better care of yourself.
You used to listen to me.
Throw him out.
You think you are on top now.
need to know.
Use it too much and it takes over.
You could come with me...
It may well be.
That's home.
Yes I see it.
But water is always the door.
You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
I can never thank you enough.
And two of your little friends.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
Give him to me.
Or you'll both be sorry.
That was meant for me!
Never saw anything like that.
Better than when I was a child.
Not doing this for you.
Just sick of this place that's all.
I have to get back to Earth.
My friends are in trouble.
You could do anything.
What would I do on Earth?
Only have the one what would I do?
It's out of the question.
A thing like that.
Forget I mentioned it.
There is a way.
No that's not true---there's well...
If there's a way in there must be a way out.
Help me to get back to Earth.
Where my friends are.
They need me.
That horrible woman!
You look at them?
But what about other people?
Of course: I am.
I do whatever I want.
Did everything just right.
Nobody telling you to change this move that around.
Well nothing we can do about it.
Come into my house.
You can stay with me until I build you your own place.
but the person who has it.
I was on Earth...
No no on the football field.
They called me...
Hey listen you thought it up we'll name it after you.
What did you tell me?
What'd I tell ya!
That's  the guy!
this is Special Order!
He said he had to have it before...
Then the order came up short.
I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
I seem to be.
Not that you ever could.
in a long time.
No well in this case I think I can speak for him.
I mean I'm pretty close to him you know.
That's why I put this one up.
He really was!
The dog's always doing that.
And the car's always doing that.
What would I do when I got there?
Girls are trying just about everything now but --
They've taken over this town.
Do you think I could do it?
I mean yes they are but I was talking about that.
I can never get a way from it.
He's not interested in any of this stuff.
This woman anyway.
And he knows it.
I mean him.
Hey he'll be all right.
You thought that?
I came close once.
and I've got a job.
That's easy to say.
Believe me I've asked myself the same question.
Why would you think that was the problem.?
You know what's the problem?
They're no problem you just pull on them and --
And here I am just standing here.
Can I give you a hand with that?
How great to see you.
Let me do it for you Mr.
Actually that's why I stopped by.
We get together sometimes.
Not quite like this.
But I've already got a lunch date.
White's new secretary.
I'd better be.
Especially about the girl back home.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
What about this week's check?
Do you know what you are?
A television set?
Have you looked for work this week Mr.
I got some work to finish up here.
And a half.
They're just.
The computer knows where.
Who gets it the company?
Look at this here!
what will I do?
it is wonderful let's face it.
Tell me more...
What will it get me?
What will it do?
In my head.
We got to build it.
We've already got some.
Fair's fair.
now listen this part's important.
And do nothing.
Just sit there.
Let me tell you something---
God that's what I keep you for.
Just hold on a minute.
Just the man I wanted to see!
First question got to be ""Where.
Yeah yeah I can do it.
That what they call you?
Under different company names.
Man what is this?
I want coffee!
What do you do with 'em?
Hey is there a bus station around here?
Let's go
I just have a little stop to make.
How you doing down there?
What she call you?
I'm his sister!
It was hot!
Why do I have to do this?
I just hope you know what you're doing.
That's his sister.
Who's the other woman?
It's hard to believe...
You just did with that great dinner.
My friend is around here somewhere I'll just look for...
The picture's fine.
That's the way she looks in real life.
That guy's gone.
But the other night...
Well not so little really.
then what can I do for you?
I get air-sick.
Okay what is it?
I'll do more than tell you.
I'll show you back at my place.
Lots of things...
So what do you have in mind?
I thought you'd never get here.
Where's it getting the power from???!
It's out of control!
He can have mine.
The boy you left behind.
Come on will you?
We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Turn on the light.
What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Hey I know a lot of things!
Why stop at coffee!
Maybe you'll turn blue.
It's up-to-date.
People I am in love with this machine.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
White the next number please?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
My friend you are yesterday.
In the old days it was simple.
This time we got it right!
He's coming!
Like fish he is.
They're all mine now!
A normal person.
I've got to get rid of him!
I've got to!
I could have it all!
It could make weather!
Nobody else ever will.
That's what I want to know!
Everything on it.
Everything on it?
I'll try to remember that.
What  was I talking about?
I just know me.
What else could I do?
All the ones who say ""Help.
Now"" I know who you'd have to pick.
Oh when it comes to you I am.
But what can you do?
There's no way now.
And I wish he were here.
we can move.
Say you love me.
You gave it all up for me.
Maybe I should change  Maybe you should too.
Let's go to my place.
""What's happening.
where do you want to.
We'd better talk.
Well not in your mind but maybe.
Maybe you wanted to.
How could I.
Listen I'll tell you what.
You say I'm wrong.
And I say I'm right.
You just get carried away sometimes.
Believe me I understand --
Oh was he here?
Until you get the bill.
Of course that's what friends are for.
Maybe I could try --
No this was good enough for my mother --
But nobody knows it.
The American answer to everything.
Well you never will again!
Does she know about it?
She's in it!
that's terrible!
Where you been  the last twelve hours?
I never knew you had one.
Give me another one.
the big one there.
I've never had one.
A good time!
Is that all you care about?!
Your idea of a good time.
That was two days ago.
It's all white.
It has everything.
No me me me.
I was in high school back in those days.
What'd he say before?
He saw a girl?
How brilliant do you have to be?!
But you had more than that and I know it.
You and my father --  you had each other.
Can I never have what you had?
Yes but it's not all I feel.
I asked the right question.
My kind of people.
Now This I want to hear.
That little black box Mr.
black box is just about ready.
It almost worked.
Oh General the world is a big place.
Second best there is.
We have all of this without you.
Wait wait wait just a moment.
Wait till you've got to know better will you please.
Wait -- look I can give you anything you want.
But him is you.
I really like it sometimes.
You'll be fine Just.
I never did this before.
I'm sorry I just never do much about that.
Especially around dinner time.
So --  I hope you like it.
I must be.
It's in there!
Any second now its --
We can take a lunch on this --
I knew it all the time.
I'll have to take the chance.
Now if you could.
I mean I've never even used it.
Beginning with this one.
Hey let's be fair.
Actually there've been two or three times --
You'll find out General!
And when you do.
Starting with your own.
I'm the President.
I will draw his fire.
With a few of my own.
These earth People.
And so I was yesterday.
And the day before.
Be nice to them my dear.
I will come to you.
What shall we do now?
Then we must go there too.
And then you shall have what you want.
A place called.
To all of us.
And what he did.
Something is happening.
I'm not so sure you do.
I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
I'm sorry to see you go.
But I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.
Let's sit down.
They walk to the table.
Is dinner ready?
Can anybody break a twenty?
I'm sure it will be a great story.
I've been very busy and.
Maybe you think the same thing about me.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
What about here?
no there's no one back home.
This is what you'll be writing about.
I've never been in a place like this before.
I know all the right places.
It's a date!
That's just it!
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Daddy thinks so too.
You know him so well.
Everyone's saying he's.
I feel it in my heart.
I think he just needs help.
Has something happened to him?
How could you not call back?
How did you know.
I've left.
How terrible can it be?
The President is about to speak.
I've got another idea.
And what do we get out of it?
And this so-called.
Do you know what the sun is?
If you can see it and I can see it maybe some day everyone will see it.
It's just.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
What good was my letter?
I know Daddy.
Keep too your own station.
Am I clear?
for  a story.
He never even said good night!
White come with me I want to see
He was getting on.
oh it's a long story.
But he's never there.
you want to tell him how you feel.
he's different.
He's late again.
maybe if I show him I'm trying.
he'll like me.
People eat it up.
One hundred percent.
And I like him that way.
Is he for real?
a couple of years.
By then I'll have a new plan.
You think he'll find us.
a nice guy who's about to finish last.
The one way he can be stopped.
Just remember I made you.
Not how I might have put it but correct.
He'll find his way back to me.
Let's try to keep your I.
But why the hair?
I could be.
I am father now.
I am a...
Just put it on.
What I need this for?
it's the way it always is.
Tell you what we'll wait right here.
Till you get back.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm taking you in.
Nobody wants war.
And then it came to me.
Just what are you up to?
Hey you look great!
It just goes around it or over it.
One of them should've been you.
We could have done that soon.
Five more years we would've had it.
But then  --  --  that silly war...
And you lost.
That's the best part!
And about time too!
He's thirty-five years old.
And what does he think about?
' I know you know.
I know but  --
It was hot yes.
I've been on the job.
It's north
I know son I know...
Your father always said so.
No mother could ask for better.
Yes but I'm the only one who knows him.
I  --  I really like the guy.
I mean I could talk to him you know?
And he could talk to me.
You're not the only one.
Oh what a chance!
If I could just  --  get to him.
well once you've had something like that happen to you it kind of changes a girl.
What'd you call him?
He held me!
I'm telling you I was there.
That's what your thinking.
Oh not really.
would you be interested in dinner?
Big night coming up?
What now my love?
I mean it's not as if --
' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from  anyway?
Are there any more at home like you?
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
I'd better get you down.
What other one?
I mean the other one!
Where's mine?!
does he live up here?
Let's get high.
I knew you'd hit me.
I have to hand it to you.
No news is not good news.
They stop for nothing.
You probably did.
What do you suggest my dear?
We just take it?
That's the name of the game.
What does it say here?
Stay and listen!
This is no time to go to bed.
This will get him.
Bet he makes it.
He's from another world.
You think he's for real?
I really needed this.
That's what I get!
A part of that will always be with me.
Why does it all mean so much to you?
The decision of the council is final.
Got all A's this year.
Why sure it is.
That's got a ring to it.
What do you make of that thing?
No one must ever know.
He will be odd different.
He will look like one of them.
A million years behind us.
-- as we will be.
Set an example.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time.
Ah this Earth...
to feel yourself.
How good it felt -
How good it felt!
Look I -- I just -
Or it was.
Can you really see through anything?
It must feel great.
Well where do we start?
One of your colleagues?
I think you'll be able to remember it.
I'd like to set the record straight.
The answer is yes.
Now what's the question?
I came to talk to you.
It's too nice a night.
Let's just say I'm a friend.
And watch yourself from now on with those things Okay?
Not while I'm around you're not.
You've got me?
Who's got you???
Easy now miss I've got you???
Good enough for you.
Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear.
As many times as I hear it...
That's the stuff!
Is that real enough for you?
I gave him this new face.
I'll never forget you for that Mr.
But what took you so long?
Did I do good Mr.
Just what you wanted.
Did you get what I asked for?
But how could you know that -  Oh well.
They'll soon be over.
Problems problems I've had so many...
Maybe I should get help.
Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
Well  --  you've got me!
What is this??!
I'll tell her that.
I hope she gets better.
Well it was nice meeting you again Mr.
We made it to the hospital.
This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.
does it turn to?
She's in trouble?
To see her.
when did she get better?
So there were others?
That was a long time
I'd heard that.
But she's well?
He used to work with you.
And what does he do again?
Still working with my father.
Yes we do know each other.
Why are you telling me this?
Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.
we've all lost our children Mr.
That's why I'm out here tonight.
You can help each other.
I mean I remember Mrs.
It just seems...
I'll be back around nine.
Was it good?
Say hello for me.
In her room.
I used to like it here.
I used to care about what happened.
I saw it happen...
I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.
That's what we used to do remember?
Help each other.
This was a community.
You know how much we need the money.
That'll be the end of it.
Gave me this piece of paper.
I've tried to stay out of it.
stay out of it.
I mean I can understand how you feel.
Or maybe they're the same thing.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I stopped by the station a while ago.
I better get back.
Just like we look forward to this.
They can look forward to that.
Behind the bus.
He never does.
What time's he coming home?
She said she's got to be home by nine.
She'll be there around six.
That's what he said is it?
What other people?
He knows that?
Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Or sixty five.
I have a question for you Mr.
He was their only child...
Did they give him special care?
Were his parents...
With our hands.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
I saw it on his face.
You talked about it?
No nothing like that.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?
Those are all from the fair last year.
Like I said they always came out together to see him off to school.
He was such a beautiful boy.
I mean the way they look.
They were the only parents who did that together like that.
You hate it.
Well it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
take it straight.
What went wrong that morning?
A cup of tea would be nice.
Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes Mrs.
You want a cup of tea or something?
That was him on the phone just now.
It's a present.
Is this mine?
So do you like your new room?
Summer's over.
What happened to summer?
Is he coming over now?
Could you tell?
Did he say what about?
He wants to come over to talk to us.
So he was mean?
The people in the town?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this.
But I'll make sure you go last.
I'm absolutely positive.
You seem very sure about that.
Not in a situation like this.
You have to think of it that way.
As people doing their jobs.
Just our side and their side.
What do you want me to do for you Mr.
Like the other children?
Then you start to feel...
You hate that.
I have no questions.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Was the bus on time?
What do they do?
Been to college.
A beautiful boy.
That's the sort of thing I need to know.
That's the local bar?
she was a friend of mine.
some business here.
Do you have a room?
I'll be there soon and I'll take care of you.
course I do.
I could get you another
You asked me what I wanted.
Not what I wanted it for.
Do you know what that means Daddy?
But this is.
Some big news.
I just need to know what state you're in so I know...
how to talk to you...
how to act...
Is that what you're thinking Daddy?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
I'm not supposed to call you?
How old was I Daddy?
Five or six?
Well let's see what we get.
I'm sorry about that Mr.
Would you like to try the fish?
Are you expensive?
I do know what's best.
That you know what's best?
So you're just the thing we need.
As far as I'm concerned somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.
That's what's done Mrs.
I've seen it happen so many times before.
A few million at the very most.
To be your
Who did they get for that?
I'll only take a moment of your time.
I know it's an awful time but it's important that we talk.
And that's all.
Then I was in the hospital.
Now that I'm telling it.
Did you say anything to Mrs.
I told you I was positive.
Seventy-two miles an hour?
You're sure of this?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
I remember clearly now.
Do you understand what I'm asking?
You remember that much?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
On the right side.
And where did you sit that morning?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
What time in the morning was this?
There's talk of that.
She'll move away.
The school board saw to that right off.
Will the police do anything to her?
How about Sunday night?
That's always the best time.
I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.
That's okay with you?
But I looked at him.
Right at him.
Not like you used to tell me.
Hard to talk to.
I thought I'd take you over.
How will he do that?
To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What about insurance?
Not for you not for any of us.
More than we can imagine.
A lot of people...
That's too high.
Does it fit?
He's about to lose his house and car.
That's the horse!
Where are we running?
Will you mind your own business!
Thanks I see him...
He's somewhere...
She's over there.
How are you tonight Mr.
We're on our way there now...
I think she will accept but I'm not sure.
Did she accept?
Come on boys break it up...
For eight weeks.
You told him that?
I did it for him and his club not your boys.
I only had a few hours.
See my mother?
it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
See you two kids later!
-- but not that much at this moment...
by the way?
Go on dear say exactly what's on your mind dear.
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!
Just exactly what are you so hot about?
Is it news to you?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Would you son?
I'll by that son.
You've been very kind about it Mr.
Now what about YOU son?
What's this about that boy?
When I'm certain I'll let you know...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Today I had to call you in!
Let me finish dear.
You had your say now let me have mine...
And he was not...
I've told you that a million times...
Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Yeah I got eyes.
I put things together.
- You gave me the item last night.
Leave this man!
Talk to her yourself...
I'd like it fine if you found another home.
That means the front door is open!
How does it matter who's sister?
The main thing they're through and -
But not for anything I did today...
that you like me.
And who's feet is she on now?
The manager yes but not the boy.
But it's too late.
I got him back the job...
I had to get him back his job.
I got that boy coming over here.
Sure you can if you want to and I know you'll want to...
He means that much to you...?
Well what have I got?
Before you go to bed.
It's later than you think.
Let me make a living!
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE!
"" Did I say no?
I'll listen one more minute.
Why not break it up yourself?
You just had a good example of it.
Can I come in for a minute?
that's why.
Can I come out?
I thought he would.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
think he SHOULD do?
He goes out with girls.
By the by what did he have against this boy?
And he's got them on him.
- He's got them on him.
After this ""set"".
He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
Could this be that boy?
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.
- that's what I mean!
What would you think of me if -
This sort of thing!
What sort of thing?
What kind of an act is this?
So take five minutes!
Can you be there by two-thirty?
What did you think would happen in his house?
And where was his wife?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
You're sure.
I've been up to here.
Has she been in?
I called you twice.
If you want me to -
Stay down town tonight.
Or what you see in me for that matter...
That's no way to talk...
I'm used to you...
You ought to be used to me by now.
you got me so...
I hate to see you like this --
It's late...
I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr.
That's the third time he's called today.
He comes to my office and -
Well thanks anyway - let's forget it.
See me in my office.
Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.
I'm busy too.
if you think -
I'm even sorry for my brother.
Why should he put on an act?
Yes but why?
and it's never Monday night again...
I came to bring him a present.
That was two months ago.
What do you do for that hundred a week.
Not what you're doing now.
What do YOU want to do?
what do you want me to do?
I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
I was born only yesterday!...
He knew what he was doing today.
You walked out and there I was...
and not too good at that.
Well maybe I was wrong too...
what you tried to do today...
Would you buy me a cup of coffee?
And the next and the next.
What can it matter after tomorrow?
until I tell my brother...
This is big you know.
With the boys.
I'm out of it.
Why did we have these two children?
Your heart and your mind are in here.
Miles it's Sunday.
You need a break.
You'll see it clear when you come back.
I thought we had it with this one...
things we would never have thought of.
All this work is based on it.
They told us not to ask where they got it.
Let me try mine.
and everything I have here.
No one must follow your work.
Look whatever you want me to do I'll do.
I order you not to!
It must end here...
or I am the future.
I have to go away John.
No no no!!
Stay with us!
I'm sorry John.
Throw it in.
Drive for a minute.
I'll deal with the police.
My father told her this...
Okay the whole thing goes ""The future is not set.
You mean people?
Yeah I thought you'd like this place.
People I mean.
And that's another thing.
See you're getting it.
How long do you live?
I mean last?
stand on one foot.
You have to do what I say?!
You told me to.
And what happens to her?
places like that.
But everything she said was true.
I need a minute here okay?
What's the dog's name?
Can I stop by my house?
So this other guy?
you're really real!
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
John get out of the way!!
I'll finish here.
We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.
How were you supposed to know?
men like you thought it up.
I love you John.
It'll by okay.
to stop me?
We may never have this opportunity again.
about the war and all that.
We're better off by ourselves.
We need it!
Out of the way John!
the future is not set.
I know but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.
Our son need you.
They took him from me.
I need you so much.
make me take this stuff...
You know I believe that.
here's the problem.
So what do you think Doctor?
If I had there would have been some evidence.
Well it's been six months and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
And what it that?
Take your kids.
What he looks like.
Everybody you him...
you're all fucking dead!
I know the date is happens!!
On all what?
Where do you stand on all this?
And this only one of these letters Major.
I have lots of them.
He never turned anyone away.
After he heard me play...
But you have no idea how people lived here.
What does he mean too correct?
And talking is talking!
Well I think we better get on.
What is it with you David?
I got letters.
With more what?
Well just like me.
Major that's not a good argument.
As many and as often as you wanted.
Did you hear the question?
That's big of him.
David need to ask you something.
They were to follow.
Where you from David?
Sounds a lot of run.
No fucking deal.
You say you answer for someone from high up.
Very high up.
This is what I'm saying.
The point is they're all full of shit.
I would like to go now please.
Why if people had no idea?
But he had no idea a lot of people had no idea.
Let me show you something and then if you want to leave you can leave please please.
His friends they did this.
What's not right?
I'm sorry but I have to leave.
I'll find other work.
You'll have to get someone else that's all.
Put it on ready to play and I'll tell you when to play it.
You have that too?
he only wrote nine Major.
Think you can get me any of that?
Your mother too.
Okay let's see.
I love my country I believe in music what was I to do?
What do you need music for?
I'll tell you then.
Listen to it.
No they picked you and why?
You were everything to them.
How can I know such a thing?
Okay so what is it?
Of course I know what that is.
Speaking to Party members I used their language of course I did everyone did.
But--  I have things here you said and wrote.
You understand nothing.
We'll call you.
Go home and think about these past twelve years.
But you see what I'm getting at?
Stop this please stop this now!
Why did you stay?
Why did you play for them?
Yes that's what happened.
But you called him something else.
You've really no idea?
Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I want him out the way.
Yes I know who he is.
What do you imagine people thought?
Let's look at that.
Then you are wrong.
' Or words to that effect.
You're the number one man.
Are you now saying you think you were wrong?
I did not know what to expect.
You have to understand who I am and what I am.
I wish to say something.
Go back into the waiting room.
Take your time with this now.
I just knew it.
I've got to hand it to the British David.
They were right to leave.
What was your Party number?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
' I knew exactly what he meant.
I need to work.
I need to make my living.
May I ask a question?
Let me me help you then.
I may have as...
Did you call someone you knew?
I made no deal!
that was a different matter I...
I was simply told.
In a letter I believe.
I want you to understand why you're here.
His private life?
And ask him about his private life.
True or not it's not such a bad idea.
Never heard of him who is he?
He got everything from them everything.
You know of anything like that?
One of my people?
One of your people told me.
This guy was a front man.
He knew everything.
He held that over me.
Was a member of...?
You wanted to see me.
And I see what you mean.
Not here Major there are people if anybody should see...
please please Major...
Yeah show me I want to see you do it.
Yes you remember.
The one he kept in his right hand.
I hear the British have his...
That's what I asked.
The evening before I see...
You were in insurance before the war.
So you never heard of him.
Come to the office please.
Which'll it be?
He was just about to ask me out.
You're not supposed to.
And so you feel nothing.
Was there someone special?
what were they like?
It'll never be over will it?
Different country different name everything.
In case they send another one.
I want it to be over for me too.
It's like there's you and me and him...
I want it to be over for you.
all the things you've never seen and done.
I was thinking there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this.
You could use one too.
Is this enough?
I'm wrong here.
Time to move out.
I'm a person...
We have to so it ourselves.
Eighty-six it.
That's the way it was told to me.
for the government.
About where you're from.
Talk some more.
It'll be light soon.
It's my first.
'  That's all.
Come on me?
The mother of the future?
John never said much about him.
Even before the war...
Tell me about my son.
Talk about something.
Like being born maybe.
you got a first name?
Nobody knew who started it.
Just start at the beginning.
There's so much...
and it absolutely will not stop.
Until you are dead.
And you're from the future too?
One possible future.
Four your point of view.
So it's from the future is that right?
Not for about forty years.
But these are new.
It's very important that you live.
Who is in authority here?
I can help you...
Then why am I talking to you?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
You've heard enough.
Where she lived just the city.
Nothing dead will go.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
it had no choice.
We'd won.
what- ever it was called...
You're a doctor?
Do you feel up to it?
Maybe I should see the...
Here drink some of this...
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Yeah I know it...
He's got her.
To make a statement.
I hate the press cases.
Call her again.
I just called.
That stuff's two hours cold.
We met this morning.
you were right.
I thought you two should meet.
Action's taken.
Your father was a friend.
If your father could see you now...
You're talking tomorrow.
Give me next quarter.
It probably will.
In fact I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will in time.
was one fifty last quarter.
You want to know what it is?
What it's all about?
No about a year ago.
Did you play recently?
Soon as I get my money for this week.
One brother one sister.
where are you from?
Maybe you could...
tell me a little about yourself.
Is this something you're interested in?
I'm not really that person I was.
Would that be...
I'm just a walk-on this time though.
I get too worked up at these.
You do know...
that's not my name.
I have to show you...
Open that door you'll see.
Your brother's there...
He's there.
It's your birthday party...
all your friends...
Let me show you...
I put it down.
Now open that door.
Stop talking to them!
This whole time...
Please you've got to believe me...
No now wait...
think about it.
What did you see...
this is the game.
This was all the game.
It's all part of the game...
It's mine...
Where'd you get that...
You call them...
You tell me...
I want to know who's behind this.
Who did this to me...
Get us out!
Get us out of here...
I'm back from the dead.
It's out of your hands.
they took just over six-hundred million.
How many times have you done this?
All I mean is...
someone like you...
It's not my real...
They did the same to him as they did to you.
He thought it was his only way back.
that day remember?
I know things...
Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
Then what good are you?
Who are ""they?
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Get out of my car!
They find me now I'm dead...
What is this!?
I'm sick of this...
They can see.
Take the picture out.
Want anything to drink?
Let me go get some clothes on.
We'll talk okay?
I'm sorry I should go.
I think I would remember.
What makes you think it's me?
You're saying it's not you?
It's okay dad.
They said five hundred.
I said six.
It was nice meeting you.
I could talk to him in the morning.
Moving money from place to place.
What exactly do you do?
That one did.
You're the one who...
You're the one who started running.
They'll love that.
It's their building.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
It's much easier this way.
You pull me up.
wait for help.
""  Wait for help.
If there was one.
from my brother.
Where'd you all go?
How do you know that's the way?
I'm sorry about this...
It's run by a company...
Things like this.
I was trying to tell you...
it's a game.
Do you know what to do?
What's with him?
Are you part of this?
Do you have something for me...
I said I was sorry...
A bad month.
Oh God yes please.
Oh this is just...
this is the bill.
I'm sorry Christ I'm sorry!
It's not true...
I'd've been here too.
I'd have been here...
You and your sick friends.
You're one of them.
You're part of it...
How did those...
They did this.
You think I know?
Why would they keep playing after you paid?
What have they been doing to you?
I paid the bill I gave 'em their money but it all started again.
How do you mean exactly?
To think what I almost got you into.
They're nothing if they're not that.
Just drive man.
Do it for YOU.
I'll call them okay?
I thought you'd like this.
Best thing I ever did.
But will you?
I said I would...
Tell me you'll call.
You've heard of it.
You've seen other people having it.
Not necessarily in that order.
Not after I'm done with it.
Actually I've been here.
Come on man...
Happy Birthday man.
Yes very lucky.
lucky for you they missed it.
We'll help with the police if you want to bother.
As far as money goes...
All I need is to get back...
just enough for that.
What did happen to you?
I'll get your car back.
We have to head out...
It would mean a lot to me...
if you and I could be friends.
If I could have you back in my life...
in some small way.
It would be important.
I want to tell you...
I'm starting to understand why you left me.
Of course you can have it if you need it.
Can I get you something to eat?
I know look at me well...
I have some things to try to take care of...
I need the car a little while.
I mean look at yourself...
Like this way...
It was a different floor then...
I never met anyone.
I'm sorry and all but...
They know you...
you worked for them.
You can get me in.
They own the whole building.
They just move from floor to floor.
How do I find them?
Nobody gets the big picture...
Look it was just a job.
Nothing personal ya know?
That's what I'm good at.
here you go...
It's never happened.
It's all down to this...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
You'll be out of here in no time.
An hour for those...
How long will these take?
You either love it or hate it.
It's different every time.
No I mean what is it FOR?
Oh here we go...
I'm not quite sure how this works.
They were my husband's.
My late husband...
You know these fit...
See you home.
Did you worry about him?
You're not like him at all.
I'm just like him.
Not much I think.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Your mother thought he was a good man.
He worked very hard.
It was easy to spend time in a room and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
He came to my mind recently that's all.
All the time I've known you you've never once asked about him.
What makes you ask?
There's been a break in.
you're alright?
I've finished for the evening.
send my love if you see him again.
The police took him.
Look where is he?!
It's a private matter for you...
What's the trouble?
I know who she is.
Let me think...
""  Is that what this is?
what I'm doing is none of your business...
I want you to know...
What about the house?
It's what they do.
Just what I told you.
You know you can.
How concerned should I be?
What's happened...
Not that you'll need it.
I've never been here.
I did okay.
The children he never had.
I think he's here.
You're not telling us something.
You get your money.
Do we still get paid for the week?
That could have been worse.
Where in the hell can she be.
Was sure she'd be in here.
-- how much is this car worth?
Will the two of you shut up!
You used the wrong test.
You want company?
So could you!
You could have.
He must have left.
Well this lot is full!
Nobody's talking to me but myself.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
Why are you working with her?
Are you working with her?
Just think what my research can do for education.
Nothing if you leave right now.
Then who called me?
But you told me to look in the paper!
You will come here now.
The children want me.
It's not real?
He's not real?
Someone starts it.
Then we all add a little more to it.
And her mother before that and so on.
What I do with this is up to me.
Someone is playing with you.
You'll never see it again.
Can I show you something you'd like to see?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Something moved you.
You saw something.
She had a look on her face.
It was very specific.
Who felt it first?
Ever since I was little.
That was my job.
I'm really happy to be here with you.
And I'm Jim.
There were no children.
How'd I know it was for you?
I could test it.
Now I have to write it up.
If he's lost somewhere in the house...
he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow until the night is over.
Let's go look for him again.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.
She needs help.
How could you do this to people?
we're all here...
Is there something about the house?
Why would that be?
I'm supposed to check in with Mrs.
No one could.
-- no one could.
In the night.
Why would we --
It's a job.
We live in town.
You must love working here.
They're so beautiful.
Then let's go get you one.
Just had to be sure.
Why are we waiting?
They're all in here.
They're just children!
We have to help them!
It all makes sense.
This is real I'm not making it up!
Then who is?
-- What do you think?
Living with me...
You want to move to New York you want to move in with me?
In the city what kind of place do you live in?
You said the Good Doctor was with you.
Maybe he did it...
Maybe you did it yourself.
No it's getting worse.
Maybe he never came in.
Maybe he's outside.
Maybe they're not even his.
Oh your hair!
It looks good.
The world has missed you.
I've missed it.
I love this house.
I really love this house.
If we could all live together...
they hate each other.
I'm between jobs right now.
My last job...
the person I was working for...
This is really you?
It's all I could afford.
That'd be seventy in New York.
What did it cost?
We think someone is here.
I sure hope so.
all my life I've never done this drive.
It must've been a time.
Not who food.
What kind of food?
You're not specific enough to be a person.
Well you're certainly not a person.
Am I a thing?
Not for you clearly.
Then what good is he?
He's been with me for years.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I used to hate it.
Now I like it.
But who gives a shit about you?
whatever-your-name is.
What shit is this.
I just do it.
When you find the guy you'll know.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
Well can we make it one more.
Not even your people should be involved.
It's too close now.
As it happens.
What did you tell them.
You should have let me do the talking.
looking for you.
Our black friends?
Been to the Boat Show.
Never been to one of these before.
You came to the right place sir.
Only we saw there was a show on thought I might pick something up for a price type of thing.
Keep one in my own home.
That's a high-end item.
The whole British bloody Post Office.
Could I get anybody interested?
What post office?
Call 'em that yeah.
Do you have any friends man?
What more do you want man?
That would be too easy.
One thing I need.
What are we standing on?
First in first out that's me.
No one else is even here yet.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house man.
They park cars.
He's having a party.
What's so fucking funny?
That was one of them?
Before she met him.
But that's not where she met me.
That's not where they met.
You believe that shit?
Private for who.
Well there you are.
Five years I think.
It's only insurance.
They were together how long?
Fucking out of order that.
for another month.
Not me man.
Go through a three-day waiting period?
That's not who I am now.
No matter what state you're in.
I already told you man.
Know what that is?
I thought someone should say something.
That was her best friend.
If he was into something if she was involved -- who can say.
Bad place man.
That's what I thought man.
I only asked.
I go to work try to keep my life together put all that shit behind me man.
I did my time okay?
Maybe they do.
No not my girl.
But that's it nothing more than that.
What more is there.
She had her life I had mine.
What's he got to say for himself?
No but between the lines eh?
That's not what I wrote to you.
Who done it then?
She never talked about any family.
Round about yeah.
I mean what has it been -- six months?
You're home then.
I'd rather be with him than without him.
Hard to miss.
No but I know what he means.
You even know what he's saying half the time?
I started writing.
Not much -- you?
Bloke told me.
Never thought of that.
But as time went on...
She never would have turned you in not in a million years.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.
Ten year old.
When I was planning some job.
I can see her the phone in her hand.
Still you could never...
do what she wanted.
Last time might as well've been the first.
Black market during the war.
What'd your father do?
Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Found this place all right.
You ever been to London?
Has to be said.
Or is all this just new to you?
What about just now?
Get seven years did you?
Not bloody likely.
I was away.
And how did you get it?
Probably sold her clothes.
Found it did you.
She'd never called me like that before.
But she never turned up.
I called the house but only got the answer machine.
When they found her...
Maybe she just wanted to drive.
She called me asked if she could come over.
There's the phone.
You want his number.
I'll bloody well ask him.
What makes you so certain.
Not the type.
What'd you want me to do.
Have you ever known me not to be.
So what's the deal.
Is that what this is about.
Ways and means.
Well not to say Mr.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
What line is he in.
Eight hours difference between here and London.
Would've been what ten in the morning my time.
Bloke come up to me he says Dave he says you've gone all white.
And I knew...
I already knew.
When was it supposed to have happened?
I like to think they're together again now.
On her own after her mum died.
I gave him yours.
I should really give him a call.
Well not to you.
I might've been away for the weekend.
When did you get in?
She was happy here.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.
How could I be.
Show up the old man you know.
Yeah well she started all that in London.
Not with that look.
She never told anyone else.
fourteen at the time?
Never did an honest day's work in my life dear.
What was that then?
Been busy have you.
Sort a few things out.
No why did you come here?
One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Of the deal man.
All of what?
Must've done.
I can well believe it.
I'm sure he has done son.
He's always been very forward-thinking.
You'd have to be more specific.
That's good that.
Turned that place completely around.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Could do yeah.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Nothing else for it.
Been away a lot.
You'll be looking forward to getting back then.
I can never decide what I like better.
While they're all fucking each other over...
Both if we're lucky.
Not week-to-week.
I happen to know more about Mr.
Something's on.
And I said so what.
SICK OLD MAN.
I got half.
Where is he then?
I know her all right.
So why would he want to see you.
What the hell are you doing here.
Who's looking for you?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
You've made it...
They're at college.
Why did you do it!
She could've had the deal!
I would have given her everything.
Start thinking they can get away with things.
I suppose that's good unless things were fine the way they were.
Really turned things around there.
After this happened things changed.
The government knows.
This was not your wife.
He never told anyone what they did outside of his report.
Of course he told *me*.
At night there were lights--we both saw them.
I came to tell you...
Will you come in?
I wanted to make you happy.
I know it would've made you happy.
You know what you are?
But more or less.
I talked to this guy.
He agreed to see you this Saturday.
I have to do it.
And he's the best.
I work pretty hard at school.
my point is you're young.
But it's not too soon to start thinking...
Sure it's his house.
But you're--
We've certainly missed you.
Oh in there?
I thought that was very good.
I was sorry to hear.
she can go up there.
Is not so hard to understand.
She seems like a very nice girl.
How'd she do?
You have a special interest in music?
You know who I am!
As per our discussion.
You bring a check?
Way out of line.
Was that a pass?
I'll have it in a week.
Fifty-fifty straight down the line.
I--tell me--
I can get it yeah.
There's money in it.
There's a future.
Say that's looking pretty good.
Thank you mother!
I'd understand if you'd walked in here.
What kind of man *are* you?
So you paid the guy?
Must've seen us.
how did he know that--
who *who* is?
How much to they want Dave?
I only work here!
And the lady's husband would know...
Well you know what that would do to me.
You know come across or everybody knows.
What is it Dave?
Say where do you get those things anyway?
How's business Dave?
That's quite a wife you got there.
My wife and I had not...
Hell I hope I've done the right thing.
But if *I* were the man I'd want to be told.
I knew we'd pay for it.
should I tell you why?
I did do that.
I know some of it.
Can I explain it.
Come on get ready.
What if I could get the money?
He told them to look at me--look at me close.
*You* explain it to me.
Will anyone say they saw you there?
On your way there?
On your was back?
Will anyone else say they knew?
A husband knows.
*I* was with her.
It was Big Dave's.
That's Opportunity.
I knew about it.
--one less thing to think about.
I'm seeing her tomorrow.
You should be there.
No talking out of school.
What's out of school?
Everything's out of school.
Yeah the best.
Might like that here.
So who should I--
He a good man?
Thanks for seeing me at home.
My wife does.
That was something.
That was quite something.
Did you make that up?
I mean how long has *this* place been here?
Just like you and me.
This is when ya come together!
And we cut it off.
And throw it away.
You ever wonder about it?
Yeah yeah--go home.
Which of these?
I mean if you're really serious.
He's the dead guy.
They sent us to tell ya.
No thanks I--
No he's family he's my brother-in- law.
Hey what's your problem friend?
Oh happy days!
I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business!
More power to ya brother!
Does he understand?
Does he understand that?
We're supposed to tell him.
His eyes are open.
Too late today.
You can see her tomorrow.
You want to see them?
It better be good.
I must have cut myself.
My office is on the third floor!
It's been over three hours --
I'll go down and speak to him.
I'm telling you something's wrong.
I think you should call it off.
I come here myself with my kids.
We're trying to work with you.
If the party goes forward and that's a big if...
Eight to the right!
To the left twice then five no...
I think it's fifteen...
it's been a while...
I made it outside.
Help is on the way.
Get back here!
Get behind me.
I've been down there.
It's right behind us!
I think I should come with you.
I've been on this case four months remember?
That's my case.
It's a piece of shit.
After hours of course.
Where's the head?
I think we may be working on the same case.
If so I could use your help.
Am I out?
May I see that?
It's some kind of letter.
I'd say we're in its home.
What's that doing here?
All right everybody hold up!
It's still back there!
You have to come!
She's found out something.
Got my hands full here.
Green has to see you!
May I see it please?
What are we talking about here?
Who could forget.
Come back and get me.
The people upstairs need us.
We have to help.
What if John was right.
I mean what if?
What a piece of work.
That's quite enough.
I'll garden.
I'm not giving up.
You have to stay out of it.
I can take care of everything.
That apparently is the problem.
I'm yesterday's news.
Leave her here with me.
Could we see them please?
No one's been down there in years.
It's from John.
Something tried to get into this room!
Happy to be useful.
Depends which house.
Not that big.
Big as a house.
We were just lost okay?
But I think it's bad.
This is a great short cut.
We're not supposed to go back there.
Jesus what is this?
Let's get back to the others.
Let's go get it now!
Shut them up!
Keep the light up.
They've got something.
Maybe we should head back.
Hard to read in this light.
take care of yourself!
This is what he or it...
But at what a price.
I'm in town on a case.
Do it quickly.
Just like John.
I should have seen it before!
It would have taken several months for the change to take place.
It's John!
The answer's right in front of us.
We have to try and draw it off!
it means it's full.
What is it doing?
Is there another way around?
How did it get here?
It makes no sense!
Like nothing I ever saw.
That would fit.
sort it out.
I have to get started.
This will take several hours.
Sometimes too much.
But I saw something.
Are you sure there are enough men in there?
If you're positive.
That's not what I saw.
Where did you see it?
It's okay I'm all right.
I remember now...
You were behind me?
Running after me?
You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Where would we find it?
It made no sense.
What was he looking for?
He was afraid of himself.
That was two years ago.
John was still in love with me.
You have time to talk?
I knew it would come back to John.
Is he really dead?
<i>A month.
For how many?
I'm sorry er...
I'm sorry to keep you.
Why would we--
It's just a matter of time.
He has to be on foot.
He gave it back to his father.
What happened down there?
What's to see?
No hold back...
Let's take another call.
--a dead one at that.
<i>You</i> were real.
That's what made you you so good to watch.
Nothing was real.
<i>A show.
</i>  Then who am I?
He's a kind boy maybe too kind.
Sure she would.
You think she'd go through with it?
How can they have a child?
Well what do you want to do?
Actually I'm free Sunday.
How about Friday?
It's not up to me.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
The thing that started all of this.
You were right about one thing.
Everybody seems to be in on it.
It's a lot of world for one man.
Stay where you are!
That's the ""Big Guy"".
I went all over but I never found a place like this.
Maybe I'm being set up for something.
Like your whole life has been building to something?
This is where it started.
I've got to show you something.
That's why we've got to get out of here.
Can you come with me?
How about them?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Sorry I'm way behind.
You coming for a drink?
I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.
Yeah what happened?
and I'll be gone.
Takes money planning.
Pick my moment.
Soon as I finish the...
See here this is us.
You said ""Do something.
""  Who were you talking to?
Who were you talking to?!
Stop this now.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?
Tell me what's happening?!
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Why do you want to have a child with me?
I'd better call your mother when we get there.
I think I'd like a little company.
You're not right in the head.
I've changed my mind again.
Or let's just see where the road takes us.
So why do you want to go?
Let's go now.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
I have to talk with you.
But not here.
Good night Mother.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
Your mother called.
I saw my father today.
This'll pass.
Everybody thinks like this now and then.
I want to get away.
See some of the world.
We'd be back to where we were five years ago.
I've been thinking--
Did something happen today?
Things always do--when you look back.
It looks so small.
Hold on a minute dear.
We ought to be getting you back Mother.
You know he was an only child like you.
Did Dad have a brother?
You'd better sit down.
You should really call before you come over dear.
Oh just so.
Well I made it through another night.
How are you Mother?
Tell her tell her...
I'll call her when I get there.
Well thank you for your help.
Is there any way around?
They had to shut her down.
You must listen.
Everybody knows about it.
They know everything you do.
Were you there--how do you know?
--How do you know about that?
I think you better tell us.
You're not supposed to talk about it?
Not supposed to talk about it.
What do I do.
They took her --
where would you like me to start?
I hope to.
Like the others.
Brought on by what?
You've got something to show me.
He's gone back there again.
A course has already been taken.
Who called this meeting?
We have a situation.
You looking for him for some other reason?
Looking for him for what?
I'm looking for him.
You got some kind of business with him?
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me?
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I've been using you?!
You've been using me --
You found something?
When it's too late.
They've been working on this for fifty years.
I'll know soon enough.
several years ago.
You know my work?
Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
And one little boy.
Those people were already dead.
But that's the thing...
What's the question nobody's asking?
Why that building?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that.
Heard you come here now and again.
Old friend of your father's.
I know the name.
Yeah, I did.
You follow me out here for a reason?
We've got to keep moving.
No -- it's --
Something's wrong...
To shut you down.
I've only held you back.
What are you not telling me here?
Yeah, well they may this one.
-- of what exactly?!
You think they went left?
One of them is wrong.
Very recently, I'd say.
And you've never seen anything like that?
Not without more information.
I need you there with me.
I'd been told as much.
And you're looking for?
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
I was until about an hour ago.
It's three AM.
Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Not after what I've seen and done.
They're doing this to me.
They were the ones that put us together.
I think you must have an idea.
Something's not right...
Move away from the door.
We're coming through it.
thirteen fifty six...
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
You're buying.
Had you big time.
That you wanted to go back.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
She was with me.
They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
My life is over.
Or it may not.
You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
That you would stop it.
Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
What do you mean, walked?
He's come and gone.
He's got too much light on him.
And who is the old.
In hope of what?
All our work...
if it's true, then they've been using us all along.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.
Is it cold in here?
I'm about to start.
If you want me to wait, or...
If you want to stop, say so.
He needs to be turned over.
Six or seven times I went in.
Remember what happened?
Why did we stop?
Leave the work here.
I'd be there for him.
I do it all the time!
I've heard this argument before.
We all believe that...
I think it does.
If you ever want to talk about it.
That last time.
He's mine?
Believe in them...
Well look at that.
Good for them.
Give her a minute.
That went well.
He wants us to follow.
The little boy...
Like hell ""wait.
Find out where she is.
What difference does it make...?
If you believe that.
Then what is he?
Not to him.
He never finished her.
he was able to make them his.
About what he did about himself.
I did yeah.
As soon as I met him you knew I'd say yes.
Why'd you bring him here?
He's this...
I suppose everyone does.
How hard could it be...?
I realize that...
Most likely that part is dead.
I'm sorry I really am.
They have so much they want to tell.
They need someone to understand why.
But these last three...
As far as I needed.
What if he was ""normal?
How far would you go?
He's beautiful...
Says I'm too serious.
I think that's the whole point.
What about the cat?
We know all see all...
Six weeks off does a body good.
You're looking well.
I have to ask you some things...
I have done this you know.
She's ""lost.
""  Someone has to go in.
And get her out.
I'll get her...
It's his dog.
Someone looking after her little girl?
Jesus Christ man you look like hell.
Next time tell me okay?
What else do we do?!
You sure you want to go through with this?
You know what time it is now...?!
There's still a lot to do.
Can you get a man close?
Tell him he's got company.
""  Wanted one just like it.
Thanks for asking.
They think you did it.
What good have we done him.
Why should he help me like that?
There's something wrong.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
I saw him today.
I shall be all right.
Here it will be cold on that train.
What is on your mind?
How did you know I would be here?
He's better dead.
I'd better not see you again.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Let's go away.
I thought you wanted...
It's just what he used to say.
Seemed like a good idea.
Oh it's very difficult.
Oh that was many years ago.
Once he tried...
what did you do?
Oh let me see.
It means she has to sit down.
Well you read this.
Can I hear you?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Might as well I suppose.
Are you busy?
Need we go through it all again?
Who are you looking for now?
Oh what was the name of that doctor?
Well if I do find out something can I look you up again?
I was told there were only two men there.
His own doctor?
He has a little dog.
Oh American thank you.
I like them.
No he never told me about his friends.
Would you like some tea?
But I could follow it fine.
It was a terrible thing.
You may as well help us.
That's what we want to find out.
It's true then?
Two weeks ago.
You can help us.
I'm in a position to help you.
I have never seen him.
There's nothing in them.
They are only love letters.
There are not many of them.
Must you take those letters?
Well I'll be saying good night.
Good night Miss.
Thank you you have been so kind.
You'll be all right here Miss.
Well I've got it when you want it miss.
They are - private - letters.
Must you take those?
How will I know you?
Just around the corner.
We are interested in this case.
Well there's not much time.
Wait a minute - let me out.
I'll do what I can if she'll let me.
I said you win.
Think it's pretty good.
What made you take up this sort of thing?
Been doing it for long?
Might interest you.
You all did.
Oh, there you are.
Which side of the road?
Where were you when you saw him first?
a week ago.
Do you see what that means?
The only important thing is that he's dead.
And there was a third man there.
Ever seen one?
Best thing that ever happened...
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
Once in a while.
See much of him before that?
When did you see him last?
Back in school.
Could you buy me one.
You could do with a drink.
Leave them for a while.
Shall I go over there sir?
This way miss.
I've read quite a few of your books.
Please be careful sir.
Up we come.
Well look is there a car here I can use?
I'll look it up for you.
Do you know his number?
Oh that is Mr.
Of course of course of course.
I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Good night old man.
Is that what you say to people after death?
No a major were you really?
Somebody hit me that's all.
Come upstairs a moment.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Very important in a place like this.
We do a little show each week.
I've read quite a few of his books.
I have never cut you out of anything yet.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
As long as they can use you?
I've got to be careful.
It's far better thing that I do...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You can get somebody else...
Well I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Did the police believe you?
I told the police.
exactly who did you tell about me?
Talk to me?...
Well well they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
What's the name of this girl?
the best way one can you know.
One has to work...
Will you give me...
She'd probably want to help.
Well there was only you and this friend of his.
you know and all that.
were of you.
We came out of his place like this and were walking this way.
A friend of his called to him from over there.
It was just about here.
Come let's sit down here.
What would you like.
Yes for a short time while they carried him across the road.
I can tell you very little.
He was run over by a car.
Coming to the point please.
I am not a bad man.
Well make it your business.
I have no evidence.
It's not my business.
Suppose I take...
She said you were up to no good.
You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Oh er - oh...
Not saw heard...
And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...
Yes happened right down there.
Yes yes I remember you.
Did you know Mr.
Why no Mr.
Should I make it all fact?
Not when I get interested.
He probably knows a lot more than that.
What else did he tell you?
That's all you meant?
Of course there was.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'll find a way to pay you back.
How would you like to know About somewhere special?
No one else knows about it.
I'm waiting on some money coming through.
It's just that at the moment you know I'm short.
Help you out?
She just went under the water.
She is gone!
I just thought you ought to know.
I think we're about half way.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Something goes wrong.
How far do you think it is?
There is one problem.
Of course but look; all these people.
It would be nice though if there was a place like that.
You know that no one could get to.
Yes he certainly did.
You're on holiday.
But he has been there off course.
I thought I was doing quite well.
Richard you know something -
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Have you told someone?
So from there to there?
Here take a look.
Always happened to someone else.
Where did you lose it?
Watch your language....
I do; I follow it.
He could never forget that.
He always was.
She's hot.
Yeah but not on the letters.
How come you know all this shit?
It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Where did you read this?
There were no six million.
Do we have to listen to this shit?
What do you like it here?
Bring your friends....
We're not his friends.
Who am I??
I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Yeah I read your piece.
And very wrong.
Anyway that was a different moment.
You write that?
She said you might come so I...
You eat first then you light.
Then we'll eat.
You have to eat.
But what if...
Did you talk to your mother today?
I just want to try it.
Do you know how many people I've brought into...
To see what it's like...
It's all you talk about.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
I told you I'm good at this.
That's your fucking God....
About doing things.
Or not believe.
Yeah it's stupid.
Put something on.
It would take years.
I want to learn to read it.
And he said.
It goes the other way.
What is this word?
This one here...
Do you know it like that?
They know the whole thing by heart.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
He's at a home out here.
I'm talking to you right now.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Bigger and better.
I'm with one right now.
Basically I am.
You're not like the others are you?...
What's he care about?
His parents are.
He's been there for ten years off and on.
Are they still together?
They're my father's.
My mother's family went there during the war.
That's where they met.
I just read it....
Where'd you read all that stuff?
You're not in school?
That's a much easier game.
He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
Did your mother know he was there?
Really which one?
Yeah I remember....
We met at that...
[meeting at your house.
Why are you taking that?
Let's go....
I'll go look....
I thought there were people here....
Do you really want to go down that road again?
It always has been.
it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us....
How am I supposed to --
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
A week or so.
There's something I want to do here first.
They left an hour ago.
You mind some personal advice?
How soon can you get back to the city?
I'm sure they are.
Only done right this time...
I'd say nothing.
They used to.
Today it's not an issue.
It's too late....
If I tell you will you pull the story?
Not write about me?
Yeah and what are you?
A <i>Times</i> man?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>.
Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Explain it so I can.
They would become as God.
Give me a reason not to.
Those people can say or do anything.
And they will.
Listen to me....
Who am I fucking with here?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
So you're saying it's not true.
How would I know him?
This is how they know themselves.
A normal man.
What's that go to do with...
Let me give you an example....
Let me ask where are your people from?
I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
So what's this about?
Is this about me?
Is it okay if I record this?
Think about your father.
I was just talking.
So are you...
But they'll believe you....
A forty-five.
There was more than one?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
I work in the DA's office.
Why did you come tonight?
To see me?
I always won.
I want you to do it on the outside too.
It's the only thing she asked from us....
How did you get the fucking number?
Who is this...?
We want to talk to you about something....
Take on something simple.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid.
But it's stupid right?
I've got to get back to the --
Do you know them?
They're not my people....
You know what it means?
To your people...
I asked him to come live with us.
I just came to get some stuff.
I'll be out in five minutes.
yeah it's true but...
how'd you get this number?...
No not here...
You have a lot of interesting ideas....
<i>New York Times</i>...?
So that's what?
Nineteen thirty minutes...
what time is it now...
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
When do you want it to go off?
No it has to be tomorrow.
I have an idea....
Why would she?
Who even knew?
Somebody must have talked.
Oh what is this shit?
Come on let's drive around....
It'll be enough if we use it right.
Okay the service'll go about another hour.
That's all we've got left.
Nobody knows where he went.
I'm always talking about it.
You know how it made me look...?
You look right through him.
He's there but there's something on the other side of him that you want.
It's all you want.
Then it's easy.
Get out of here....
Her place is down the road.
Which was his room?
Yeah hey how're you doing...
Not that kind of...
More a private...
I'm in a kind of...
I can tell....
But no one this important.
We have nothing to learn from these people.
They should learn from us.
What do you think you should have done?
SO HE WAS DEAD.
HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW.
HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Just a little...
He was funny.
Not like Mr.
Do I give a shit?
It's Friday....
Do you think I...
I was just trying to make a point.
Let's get him one....
Will you do that for us?
I mean I read but...
We think you'd be good at it.
We want you to help run it.
And let us say...
Who thinks about such things?
I'm waiting for the right moment.
Very much I think.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I think he's really nice...
He's a funny guy...
sometimes even very moving.
I'm so happy.
He seems to have won it.
I really went on my own business to see a man that I happen to be in love with...
and I think this is where you fire me?
the whole business.
What's happened??
Of course not definitely not...
well maybe a little.
This is good work...
Is that who you want to live with?
Is he alright?
And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish!
He can learn.
You see I was right in getting you out here.
Well good night then...
And the lights!
You go down.
You come up.
Listen to her!
""That's what he's here for""!
Second how old are you?
Well listen to him!
And just where are you from?
What was he like when he was little?
Have you known him long?
You'll be lovely but no thanks.
We'll live in the sun.
A new world record!
I might have known.
I think I'll have a coffee.
I wish but it's full.
All the way out here.
I tell you she's mine!
How many are down there?
and then the boat turned over...
in the current...
He's training.
This is not a ""that""...
Try speaking to me?
For others yes...
For you who knows?
And where did you say you were from?
It is much better down there.
It's a better place.
I was right about what?
Well that's very nice of you.
I was lucky...
Thank you thank you very much!
I've had many...
Anybody can have a bad day!
I give you this.
And he does that very well let me tell you.
It's really beautiful.
I knew it I just knew it!
When did you learn how to drive?
You're the only one who'll understand.
Everything about what?
Sometimes they are...
What exactly do you want to know?
Are they what's most important?
Today at lunch you asked me if I had any questions.
People say that?
That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Exactly I mean after all we're men!
You play the field like me.
for a week.
How do you make a living?
Well what are they?
Lots of questions.
So after all these years you must have lots of questions to ask.
I'll go somewhere else.
What did I just hear?
What room have you got?
That's too easy!
He's supposed to be very good!
I'll see you there...
All you need is to want to be the best.
Looking good no?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Does anybody live to make a second?
You are the father.
that's wonderful.
It's wonderful for you.
I saw how it has to be.
You've got to tell me what happened?
with that machine...
What does it feel like?
You go back I'll walk.
You'll try again tomorrow?
It's me again.
Only then do they start coming out.
Do you know how it is?
Then tell me a story.
It's hard you know.
Well then talk to me some more.
That's funny...
But it's not true I feel good with you...
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
You're afraid I want to hold onto you and I do but you're not ready...
Yes of course!
She's not like the others.
Yes of course!!
I'd better get back now.
I want to show you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
Maybe on earth there is one...
just to do it.
Expect for you.
It's beautiful here.
I thought it was a nice place.
It looks great!
I work for an insurance company.
So I decided to take a few days off.
We saw each other a little while ago.
That's different!
That way I'll see more of you...
When I was in New York oh boy!
I have no use for a woman!
I'm always the one asking the question!
and see a doctor will ya?
I was supposed to be in love...
I was in love!
It was too good to be true.
I'm a terrible person...
You look it too.
Way past it.
Who'd you meet?
Of course that's what they're for.
If there was a problem they could do something right?
I'll go see how he's doing.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
You'll have it by the end of the week how's that?
His mother's an American.
Coffee might be nice.
For one thing it's his job...
as for the rest of it I wish I knew.
Why is he doing this?
He should come up soon.
Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
How long can he stay down?
Listen to his heart.
I know sir.
I love her sir.
So why the long face?
Thank god you're here.
You take care of yourself.
Well then I've got good news for you.
I'll check in with you when I know more.
What's your first move?
I did what I had to do.
He works too much.
Take his mind off his work.
he's very nice.
Please you have to help me.
You two know each other?
I was just playing along...
What else did she have to say?
Oh she said that did she?
Your mother was right.
You do work too hard.
I'm better with men.
I said yeah about once a week!
I said do you come here often!?
What was that!?
Want to get a drink?
He was a good friend but my days...
Such a good boy you are!
It is good enough...
And when my face is all over the television.
I do good things for this community.
I help people.
You're my mother.
Do you love your mother?
And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
I just thought that you might want to know.
Okay what's the information?
Watch him for me.
Well that's good news for us.
This should be easy.
But wait there's more.
Man that's far out!
What's it do?
But please stop with the pressure.
You got any information for me?
Oh most definitely.
I'm too strong for it.
Do I know you friend?
Take a look around you.
Do you even know who I am?
Why'd he stop?
Oh did I tell you.
You were right it is good.
So how was I?
That's some cold shit.
You get your money from your husband.
Why do you ask so many questions?
Is he in love with you?
Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want.
How much money has he?
My soninlaw.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
You could do anything in that time.
Where did you find it?
What do you want to see him for?
I'm serious about this.
Where's that man?
I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons.
See you tomorrow -
The death card - -
Let me see it 
Something black - something on its way to you 
What are you doing that for?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Watch and see A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
I look for them with money.
You're not telling me anything.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
I suppose it will be different for us too  when everyone knows.
Then we will be just like other people.
Love is different for different people.
He will be there at four.
He will be waiting...
Hey  I'm over here.
I wish he'd front page for me.
She's a local.
Oh that's so interesting!
I saw it day and night.
You've thought of all this before.
He'd act normally when he was with other people.
How would he act?
What would he do?
Like other men.
All right -- the dead then.
You know a lot.
Yes but what sort of a man?
It was a man!
I went back and I tried again.
There are all sorts of men.
It could be a man.
That's one reason I wanted to see you.
I'll take you about.
Got some nice things.
Come to look around?
We're old friends.
Let him go on.
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
That's right of course.
I'm quite sure.
Well I'd best be off.
No - really I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
I thought they came right past here 
I'm sorry -
Well I'm next.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks.
He as good as said so 
I'm sure of it!
Ask any woman.
Let me get one thing clear.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Yes there is something wrong.
Go on foot.
That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Now we've got to do it ourselves.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
All I know is I want to do something about all this.
You already know the answer to that.
Why do you want to stay around here?
They only missed each other by a few minutes.
That was nice of Mr.
I can use them.
As long as my feet held out.
Well does everybody love us now?
We all had to look at the body.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
Who was the other man?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Now look what you've done.
My black one.
Then I'll be just like him.
No  not yet.
You're too good to me.
On his back I suppose.
Makes no difference.
Get him out.
No - not yet.
Get him out!
What about that road back there though?
Must be good for business.
Would you like a drink while you wait?
I work here sir.
Do you wish...
When will they be back?
Will you please come with me?
The dead can wait.
What are we...
Get to the point will you...
I called my parents told them everything...
They found his body yesterday.
MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!
Call my parents.
Perhaps I did...
We he said.
He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything...
We all have to like what we become.
What was the idea?
Five years of it.
Is there anything to understand?
Think what you like.
My husband did not tell me...
You sure were right.
If-if my car is there I could be the one who...
How did he do it eh?
When did you...
I believe you know your way out.
Or is it the other way round?
He just might show up.
Have you found him yet?
Anything that makes money really.
Well I found a little more than that.
Let me put it this way:...
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
You lost my money?
Tonight my social life.
We have two minutes.
Come in and close the door will you?
And take your sick tape with you...
I told you I had bad news...
The boy you said my brother bought!
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Can it be that easy?
And that is the last time any...
Three weeks ago.
A call box?
Are you sure you have the right number?
Let me check it for you sir.
You must be from Europe.
Could you try that again?
Then find another way.
Have you found your man?
But not before you hear?
You told me you knew where to find him remember?
I have no...
You need help we need information.
Jane wants you to call her back.
I might come back I might not.
I know where to look.
Just the kind who might help me...
It will take a few days for the things I need to get here.
You want money right?
If you could get to the point...
Got anything to say?
So what are you looking for?
From three to twelve months.
What sort have you got?
This is a bad line.
May I have your phone number?
Have we done business before?
At the front...
They run the place.
What about the staff?
How many of them?
Down the road.
He took your money.
I need a doctor...
We all work for the company.
Where are the other five?
Ever seen him before?
He left this fucking bloody morning...
On the bed!
I certainly did sir...
As a matter of fact he called this morning sir.
Thank you Jane.
And how are you eh?
I mean not this but...
Who are you eh?
Come on I need you.
I told you on the phone.
I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.
Do you know where it is?
Bye bye Jane.
Another boy you know?
All I meet is boys.
I mean is it true?
You must know him?
I mean just as a name right?
Must be your lucky day then.
How are you Jane?
As far as you know when and where was your son last seen?
But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
It all looked normal.
So as you see I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks.
You might as well know that...
You may not.
What if it is?
Good afternoon Mrs...?
Is that too hard for you?
The sick ones are out there friend.
You people are sick.
This one came back and was never seen again.
Six weeks ago.
He bought a boy of yours.
Am I supposed to know him?
Is my money in there?
The boy is yours you understand?
You can do anything you like.
Ask for Peter.
At what time will you be available?
Is it just you or...
Not much to go on is it?
Your lady friend did.
Should I come back in five minutes?
Five to three.
I really need to see him before I leave.
I just come from his place and there was no one there.
Table for one?
What about before he turned up with the boy?
Three thousand pounds.
They used to be close...
It was something else.
You just took his word for it?
She just moved.
My number if anything happens.
Is she on the phone?
Who else knows about the boy?
Came here before the war.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
I mean people who sell children...
Things to come to terms with.
He just said he had good reasons.
Take him away?
You thought wrong.
Well I obviously do.
But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
How do you know me?
Can I get up now?
Now can you stand up?
She was with him when we met.
One and the same man one and the same.
Maybe you should think yourself lucky.
I know his work better than I know him.
But maybe you know someone who does.
How many can there be?
How much would it cost me?
What are you eh?
Shut up and walk...
I can only tell you what he told us...
Anyway you get the picture.
They lost their son.
Can I go on now?
or his hands?
it's not so easy...
That's fine...
I place her in your care.
Of course I am it's just that...
My lord I'm not sure that...
if she can find me?
-- That's a brilliant idea!
Bring her up!
Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
I have a new horse now a white one just like yours...
One day you will.
I'm already free...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I am ready now...
what's the point?
It would not be the same without you.
If God wants me to win he will find a way.
if he wants me back...
then that's fine too.
But it is what I want.
you've done so much for God as it is...
I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once?
if they come back one day.
He said that...
That's not what I asked...
If you really want to help me there's one thing you can do.
I believe in you...
more than anyone...
And why let this war go on for a hundred years?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
Well of course they're me!
If you listen hard enough even you can hear him.
Everyone can hear him.
what am I supposed to do now?
Yes I'm fine...
We won just as you said!
Come with me...
it's nothing it's...
we're almost there...
they will think about it.
Who do they think I am?!
Who do you want to write to?
This I can do.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Better today than tomorrow.
Do you think I could have some water?
well yes it was my idea but...
We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!
But that was her order!
I held it up to...
too strong perhaps...?
No of course not...
And so I...
And why was that?
Did it have some particular value or power?
I leave the answer to God.
That is not what is written in the evidence...
look for yourself!
I tried to.
why not ask Him yourself?
Go onto the next question.
Thirty years ago?
And when was that?
it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Oh yes my lady.
Well find some other way!
Sounds good to me...
You also must realize that many of my colleagues are...
Well what are you waiting for?
you've seen how it is.
This girl has a way with people...
I have the right to do anything I like.
Ah yes of course...
I wonder how much they'll pay...
I'll be right here...
No no I'm fine really...
I ask only one thing...
It's not my body I want to save.
it was the only way to save you from the fire!
why did you do it?
Take her away...!
may I have it back...
I'm trying to save you!
Is that what you want??
that is to say us.
Is it here?
In this room?
Did it give you advice?
What did it tell you?
A day a week -- when?
Not long ago...
I would like to have it back.
I will hear you...
but not now not here.
Oh thank you Lord!
Will you hear me now?
shall we say...
Thanks be to God.
You really think she's been sent...
ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
So how would you put it?
All I needed was another few hundred men...
Get them out of here!
You look wonderful...
nothing is ready...
Take some rest.
what did he say?
You did well...
To help my country?
But how could I do that?
so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be soon.
Let them come!
The other half.
I can see her if I want to.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
We know nothing about her...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
You will answer the question...
Go on to the next question.
or a man...
By what he said?
I'm more interested in what he says not what he looks like.
Does he have hair?
Part of it...
or all of it?
Go and ask him yourself.
I will give you his answer tomorrow.
That's not a lot.
We need another ten minutes...
you've got it back to front...
Ah so that's it.
To you I'm just a girl.
is that the only advice you can ever come up with??
Fine -- go now if you want but not with me!
What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Can you bring me to him?
Where is the food?
And it's not the first one!
I have wonderful news!
This is no good!
It was a Sunday...
God's day off.
We have nothing to do here...
none of us...
He never sent them...
Of course I do?
Bring them up!
we're not enough...
Do we let them go too?
let him do it.
For weeks you've been asking for this...
well now you have it!
not like this...
I leave that to God.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.
The clothes are not important...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
I know but that's not the way things happened...
That's now what I meant...
That's different...
I'll stay standing...
that's the price of his life?
You call this...
Such a small word will never do!
Not for long...
God knows but it was a bad idea!
Did you both meet already?
Hey my friend!
Yes I was given a few but I never had time to wear them...
As much as for a Lord?
How many did he give you?
Who gave you that horse?
You think you are ready now?
Do you think you are ready?
Are you sent by God?
do you think they will ever come back?
What are you doing on the wall?
all of them...
Why are you doing this to me??
No I do not think so.
No no you did fine.
I'd even say well done.
""Let all who love me follow me""...
Where does God get mentioned?
In His name??
lots of things!
God asked you to do something?
and I've done everything he asked me...
I want to see that.
Do you mind if I stay...
on the side?
Are you waiting for someone else?
I told you already...
I'm here to set you free...
You know what He'd say to you if He was here?
If you were true to yourself...
I might ask you the same question.
tell me I'm dead...
He needs me...
Are you God?
I am that I am.
who are you...?
I want to be at one with Him now.
I want to be with him always...
Then what will?
And what will bring her back?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I heard about your sister and I...
he says I must be good...
and help everyone...
and take care of myself.
And what does he say to you?
He never says his name.
Who is this ""he""?
And it's where I can talk to him.
why are you here so often?
Oh yes I play with them...
And what about your other friends...
Oh yes my sister's just...
And your sister...
Oh yes she's...
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Well no but...
Mine were too small.
I knew them well.
Someone you know?
It's like this...
all of them.
Why are you here Mr.
Who wants me to stop?
He's still a doctor.
This is my husband.
This is not a good time to have children.
Just over a year.
He'll be here soon.
I need somewhere to stay.
He's my husband.
I'll see you...
Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
What do they think they're doing?
Where will we get them?
Let me see this.
Will I still be able to play?
Where do you want me to go?
I'm on the run!
Get your things together you have to leave!
Yes but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
wish I knew you better.
Funny time to say this.
Oh my God it's terrible you've got to do something oh my God!
What I'm working what?
People I know.
They said you're an important man.
Then there's nothing I can do.
I've no money.
Oh you need me now yes now you need me!
Believe me they've picked him up.
You've got no work...
Yes I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here.
Your whole family can have a better life.
Look at my father look at us I mean...
I've come here as a friend.
What's the matter with you all?
Okay then I'll tell you something funny.
Sit down have tea I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
And suppose they take the table away?
Yes that's why I brought it.
That's also my business.
It's me they wanted not you.
They were taking you away.
I can look after myself!
With what could I pay him?
What did you pay him?
Well you know what's funny?
That's better than yesterday.
You sell anything?
Three hundred and sixty thousand so it'll be easy.
it's too small...
A good place for what?
But look--  This is a good place for something.
We leave the money and the watch on the table.
And we cover it like this.
In full view.
We use what?
You know what we do?
That makes a change.
Listen I've been thinking --
It certainly was.
And you know something else?
Yes but what good did it do?
Who'd have thought?
should never have come out.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Can you do something for him?
I've no money...
I have to say you look terrible.
You're too...
But I want to help I want to.
You do enough.
So what's the news?
They bring me news and food.
Today's news from the other side.
Fine we're fine thank you and you?
Takes one to know one!
Be ready to leave in two days' time.
Same place as last night.
I tried your friends.
I saw someone I knew.
I've written their names down.
If they're still there.
Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I want to get out of here.
If you need help...
We know what it means.
We sent someone out.
We're sixty thousand left.
Out of half a million.
Since last night.
I was pleased to see you.
It's a little cut nothing.
It's been over two weeks.
You've nothing to worry about.
I saw you almost every day.
I'll listen out for you.
I've got another one.
What will you do when it's all over?
That's what we have to believe.
We're getting out.
All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
What's your work?
Oh yes dear too - TERRIBLE!
Watch his hand
Watch his hand.
Watch your feet!
Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
That is good yes.
He's getting on all right?
No it was a table.
No I love her we will be a family.
I worry for you.
Your wife where she?
No but her words are in my head.
No the words I heard were her words.
No not words.
You have never heard words?
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
I have given it back.
Nothing just yet
I'll have to come and hear you play.
what do you play.
Yes why not.
Yes I suppose you would.
Yes I thought that.
What are you about?
They want more money.
They are trying to make two days out of it?
I'm sure we did.
Someone died here.
What's he say?
What did she tell him?
I just want to listen.
Everyone has to practice.
I'd rather not play.
I want to listen and learn that way.
She wants to see what you can do.
What will I play?
He's given it to us.
She never gives him a turn.
I know why Mr.
and you will be able to play on it...
I am very pleased....
Yes and so do I but there are too few of us here to carry it.
She wants it to come.
It must come.
Right through there.
I think I'll keep that to myself.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Line on Single Action...
Hell with it that's no good.
Hell no I just cut into him.
I'll give you the whole hundred!
No wonder you got hit.
He's got all the money.
Never saw him before.
Let's see who's in town.
I got twenty or so in here tonight.
When did you get back in town?
You know everything I know.
We can do anything we want now.
I think it's the best...
You think my play is bad?
How much did ya lose?
They'll get him next time.
I need somebody careful.
He does this every year.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.
Nothing serious it just put us a little behind for the day.
Everybody else is in.
He never gets anything first...
You could buy yourself some things.
Clothes or a nice car...
After three years.
What do ya want the others to get?
I'll cut it in on his deal.
Who's got the contract?
They're still looking for him.
Get some local people to take care of the other two.
know how to use this thing?
I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Looks all right.
It's big enough and off the street.
But it's close.
We had it down to a business.
Believe me I've seen enough to know.
Christ they'll probably miss you and hit me.
I can stay clear that long.
I told ya everything there is.
I thought I'd lost him.
You think he'll show?
Did he hold you up on anything?
What do ya mean?
Everything go all right?
How'd ya do?
If we ever get to it.
Let him wait.
Then you'll do it?
And no matter how much you take from his he'll get more.
We'll get by without 'em.
I'll take him anyway.
You know anything about him?
I picked something up on the way.
I already know how to drink.
We'll give him the shut-out.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
I got you one of each.
I'm not sure I know it.
If ya win it could make ya too.
We lose a bet that big it could break us.
You come to a game like this you bring your money.
Five and call.
My end was only one.
You need a friend.
All right I'll give ya a break.
Go on in there and wait at the window.
I'll take this...
in the back and run it through right away.
We'll get 'em!
Give us a chance.
But what about all these other people?
You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
But I got a train to make.
I'm just like you...
And you expect me to come over just like that.
Looks like he missed ya.
What does this guy want?
What's wrong with the front?
You got a back door to this place?
What time you get off work here?
Depends what train I get on.
Where's June today?
What the hell's the matter with you.
He wants to see you a second.
And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
All right when?
He wants to see ya.
They're just the only ones we know of.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
I feel lucky tonight.
It's all over now.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow.
And make sure I can get to that window this time.
A week's a long time friend.
All of it bad.
She got me with her ring.
You want your money back?
Try and get it in a court of law.
That's my money.
Not yet but...
I could do it every day.
You're a lucky man all right.
Well what did I tell ya?
Give 'em a little time.
This is just a test.
The big one comes later.
Be careful with that though it's all I got.
Get on with it then.
If I'm not there by quarter of I'm not coming.
Maybe a couple million.
I want you to help me break him.
He'll have to take a check.
How does he do it?
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
I mean completely played.
You want a drink or something?
I said place.
Everything's all right.
The hell with ya.
We'll keep the deal we got.
Anybody can get lucky once.
But who says you will.
He took it hard.
We missed him.
Never heard of the place.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
How much a week?
For fifteen years.
I think he will.
He'll never do it.
Well we do.
Sit down and shut up will ya.
We'll see you before you go.
Is that what it means?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
You know how they are...
He's just around the corner.
I've tried everything.
I thought you might know.
What could happen to him darling?
I know something's happened to him.
Darling your father's all right.
He'll turn up in time.
What's the matter darling...
You better take a drink.
Do you suppose.....
That is if it's all right with you.
It's the same one.
Another young man.
You're high enough.
listen to me.
keep it all in the family.
That's what Father should have done.
right now and --
Do you think I care
You've got to get your mind off this.
Now do you believe me!
It's your father's.
I'll tell them.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
You hand that over to the police.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
But we've got to have money.
That's gone long ago.
I've got to see him.
He made a big settlement on you.
It was about your father.
Do you know where he's living?
Has he found him?
Oh here she is.
How are you?....
Oh I'm Mrs.
Is it about her father?
He's waiting for you.
Is your father still in there?
Get under this.
He's been dead for three months.
not back from it.
in the heart.
Where did you hit her?
She kept me from seeing my father.
I went down there to ask her where he was.
That you did it?
tried him once -
He worked on a case for father.
Were they true?
How did you ever remember me?
Of course we do!
We've been friends for years.
You know we know each other.
Better get home before it is.
Only in bad weather.
Poor Dad does that still bother you?
Like all the rest of us.
has he seen the whole family?
I know -- I know --
You know how it is Dad.
I'd like to see him.
How's your brother?
I ought to be starting.
Oh I'll be back before Christmas.
I've got an important idea to work on.
If you think it'll be all right.
He can stay home.
all of us there...
What would your mother say to that?
Yes she would.
Dad this is what I really wanted to ask you....
You see how much we have to say.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Take a good look at him Dad.
Now please try to remember him...
It's been the same one for three months.
Must have been in the war.
I'm very interested in that body.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
You can take that out to the car.
But I saw him -
I saw him too...
Children will you go into the next room?
She could tell you where father is.
He said that father's in town.
You mean that body-----?
I'll take care of him.
Could this be him?
""  That case you worked on...
what what was his name?
This is enough for me.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
She's ready to talk.
I want to see where he goes.
Well what'd you think?
Let's go and see.
Oh he's all right.
We know all about him.
I'll check on that.
we had to let him go.
This is the way we figure it.
So he goes away.
You've been there?
I thought it might be.
Anything you want to know?
Man to man I'm not.
Man to man Mr.
Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
There's plenty of time.
I'll have to try to remember.
Who's is it?
Keep on asking.
What'd he think it was to you?
What's that to you?
What's he want of you?
I never saw him before.
Then we seen him...
And pretty lucky for you.
We'll call you when we need you again.
Oh then you did hear from him?
Let him have his say out.
That's nothing.
I saw him myself.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Oh there are two more to come.
I think we may as well sit down.
But he's interested!
Just give me a minute....
that's the afternoon I was....
wait I'll show you...!
Maybe I was here.
She'd remember.
Let me bring her back.
I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I'll do anything!
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.
Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her but that's all I knew her.
Why you said...
Just what I said I'd do.
I said all right!
You've said that for weeks.
I'll get some.
How can I help but mind?
Then someone was in with you.
-- Who was it?
I'll answer that --  Hello...
I never had it.
What did you do with the rest?
I'll give it back to you....
all I've got....
twenty-five thousand...
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
with your record.
I want that money right now or I'll hand you over to the police.
And I've given my whole life for you.
Who has a better right --?
What if I did take them?
You took them.
What did you do with them?
I'd never tell you to sell those.
Why you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I just came back for a second.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
He's not anybody.
Who's that man?
We're just having a little drink.
Oh he's sitting up.
She'll get it from you.
But what if you need more money?
What'll I do if something comes up?
You might do that.
Well let me do that for you.
But suppose some business comes up...
I'm not telling anyone.
Did you get my money?
I have no right to answer that.
He called when you were out.
When is the next train?
Right - I'll get that.
I thought if you got on the case you'd be able to clear him.
I was sure that....
Oh well well...
it's no use thinking of it now.
oh just a minute.
I've done that already.
What did you say?....
He's back in town....
He's waiting for me now.
I must be off.
I give it to her and she gives it to him.
No word at all?
You know as much about it as I do.
And I'm looking after them.
She usually is.
Does she have to be up to something?
Nothing thank you.
But then you'd do anything for money.
I did see him!
he's sitting at this table.
So I did.
Why you said yourself you saw him last night.
Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Oh did he?
All right then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
They'll want more than your word for that.
That's not for you to decide.
Is this a picture of him?
But he has nothing to do with it!
Is he here too?
But he knows you.
but that I've got to see him.
I have something very important to tell him.
He thinks I just want money.
No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
want to talk to you about something very important.
He went to find the man.
That man was....
This is your party.
I am on the level.
If I knew anything I'd....
The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.
Now I come to you on the level.
Be on the level.
I'd tell you if I knew.
But I'm not in this.
Ask the police.
He'd like to see you.
What's the law doing to me?
I've got nothing to do with it.
She was always on the up and up with me.
I've never heard about you.
I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight.
to the police.
I hope you're well.
It's the only way it makes sense.
Why are you saying it?
the first day that you came to see me...
where was I?
I wish you'd tell me who.
Tell me do you think one of them did it?
Oh they'll come.
Want to see me take him?
She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Nobody but you.
Couple of months anyway.
How long has he been dead?
So I looked for it and I found it.
What things made you so sure?
Oh and coffee.
That's what they think...
He was down in the shop.
I did find him!
Say it as if you meant it.
Sure I will.
Not with all your money!
Go on - go on - see if I care.
I know but this is different.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I've got to find out.
He went away.
Looks like a hold-up!
He's just been for a walk.
I wish they'd stop that.
He must be in New York....
And I wanted you to find out who did it.
All right hard guy.
Oh take it!
Please take it!
Where's it from?
Did I give it to you?
Is that another Christmas present?
send him up.
Finished with these?
I never saw that before.
I'm in it...
They think I did it!
He's got more sense than you have.
You're a fine watch dog.
I wish that doctor'd come.
Well quick -- get into bed.
There's one coming.
Someone get a doctor.
what's on your mind?
Now stay there.
There's someone to she you
You'll have to keep them anyway.
But it's Christmas now.
I think I would like that drink.
I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
She thinks you can.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
I'd like to see you work.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Maybe a drink would help you.
They might believe her.
She brought it in.
Trying to make me believe she did it.
Sounds like a good case.
No one knows who did it.
Room service please -
I'd better order some food.
That sounds like an interesting case.
What hit me?
Much better thanks.
By the way how is your father's side?
We were all like that on my father's side.
Only you darling...
If you like 'em like that.
What I've gone through --
You might have mentioned me first.
I had him out this morning.
So it's you he was after!
You can save that and tell it to the police.
They'll be here in a minute.
Trying to put it off on her?
That time you sent me up last...
Well that's a hot one.
You worked here?
I worked here...
Come on out now.
You his wife?
Oh yes -- yes -- that's right --
Maybe she has.
I know I left them there.
Thought I'd better do it now before I forget it.
That's funny....
You're through!
Get your things and get out!
I just wanted to tell you...
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Turn the car around.
If I give it to you will you let us go?
So you can give us away?
I have to answer him.
That's just what things came to.
And now you let me down.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
You left me for dead.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
We been down this road.
I told you how it is.
Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
In the service you do but we're not particularly in the service right now.
That's all the authority I need.
We are not at war!
We have no authority--
We're at war.
It's light enough.
he could have been watching us.
Says he wanted food.
Get off him!
Get off him.
Then get up and do something about it.
You got no reason to hit me.
You got no reason to do that!
Maybe I can do better on my own.
Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Now leave it.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.
So we wait.
There's a lot of space up here.
They could be just about--
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
What do you figure it to be?
Not much of a pass.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
You just go when I say go.
Break it out.
What kind of mine?
He's not so--
Not much chance of that.
But if we do it we do it right.
Low on gas.
Oh Jesus they've stopped.
No please not again.
I believe it is.
I'm thinking about when this war is over.
Why you figure I'm here?
So I say if maybe there's something out there what the hell that's what I say.
What the hell are you thinking?
Can you eat it?
You know so much about the Middle East you know where we can get something to eat.
Not up to us.
Lot of land not many people.
I've never been anywhere.
Where should I go?
I'm no better than anybody else.
But I'd say you've been very fair.
This whole time you've kept your head.
You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.
And you've been fair too.
I mean even after I...
I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Yeah but why me?
It's always been like that.
Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
We go this way.
Which way do we go!?
No but I figure now's a real good time to start.
I never said--
You come up with a better plan let me know.
Against how many?
What do you make of them?
Get all the water you can carry and we'll head out on foot.
I just said I would.
What do you figure it is?
Time for a new deal.
I just want to look at it.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Just let me rest for a second.
Then we go this way.
I pick that way.
You sure you want me too?
We've got to start moving so pick.
We've got enough water for that.
I never was anybody.
When I was in high school I used to--
Really I'm not.
That's all it was was talk.
I talk a good game but I'm not like that.
Well me too.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Not when we're so close.
And you; you've got it all together.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We got to go back.
We'll find our way!
We'll find our way.
It should or it will?
What the hell took so long.
Yeah that'll work.
Why do I have to stay down here?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?
All he has to do is cut the line...
Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
It's giving.
I feel air.
That's where the light comes from.
If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
So where do we start?
A whole lot of nothing.
If they land we can take them.
If they land--
Just stay down.
Where the hell is it!?
Where'd it go?
I hope it means something otherwise...
Thanks for playing.
Shut up and listen!
Yeah I understand.
We're in this together understand?
You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
We'll get you off of there.
I got that...
We leave it.
And you missed this?
LOOK AT IT!
But I'm saying if they knew.
I'm just thinking you know if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.
I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Yeah she's fine.
We can see them they can see us.
We've got to do something.
We've got to turn around.
Both of you shut the hell up!
A little goes a long way.
Now this is war.
It's that easy.
It's all all right.
But we all got to be in for this.
We all go or we do nothing.
People get lost all the time in war cut off--
And you know what that area is?
Maybe you've read about it.
You know this stuff.
Just listen to me!
I read about this man.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.
Everybody's got a job to do.
Same place we've been since we got here.
Yeah that's exactly what I think.
I got the box open.
There might be.
There might be something in there.
What are you supposed to be doing?
At-at-at-at-at.
At-at- at-at--
They're all good ones.
Some good ones.
want to be ready when we do.
See how I mean?
That's why they wear them.
You want to say some words?
Maybe we ought to...
Say some words over him.
So we'll take him with us.
I think he wants something to drink.
All last night he could have been--
Maybe we should give him some water.
He lived through that?
I think we found something.
Yeah we're down.
It's got a bottom.
Think we can make it?
Is there anything you do know?
What the hell did he do that for?
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
You have to go with us.
We're not that far.
We can make it.
You know what happened?
We have to go back.
Yeah well we're not.
I thought we were dead.
Right by us.
They went right by.
They're not...
They're not supposed to be here.
A car is not just a car where I come from.
You know what I'm doing with my half?
How the hell should I know how much?
What kind you figure it is?
Hell we'll just buy our way out.
You know it's real.
You know it's real and you know it's there.
I'm telling you it's real.
It's not a hundred miles.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.
How long do you think it would take us to--
You're not saying what I think you're saying.
we could go home with something else.
Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
It's happening but it's not.
You ever think about it?
You ever worry?
I almost had this thing open.
You have a point?
We stand at full ready starting--
Like I said; so?
That's in two days.
He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You get it yet?
Yeah you're funny.
He says it's a box.
Now you need me.
How do you say ""Come here baby.
""  I can use that now.
I thought it would be good to know.
That's exactly it.
Could you stop please.
It's wrong; so wrong what we've done....
I'm not afraid...
It's the end.
They've been watching us.
I'll never make it the way I am now.
You see it every day.
Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I though  I'm afraid.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.
you're so beautiful.
once I started.
I almost let you go on so many times.
It will be worth it together.
now I'm sorry...
I was happy.
Why get me involved?
Looks like food.
That's not food.
I've never been under the table before.
You asked me about the card.
Eat your dinner.
You've seen enough.
Why did you change it?
Do you know what your trouble is?
We need action.
) We have come to a time when we must....
You can work with us.
You want to leave.
You're not like them.
You must have left something or someone.
I thought you were through with it!
We can leave.
We must wait until...
Ask him about the air.
I wonder how far he went.
He's coming back for the rest of us.
How far did you go?
Was it cold?
I'll report you.
I can clear myself for any area.....
We'll be happy.
She was here..
It will be good for both of us.
Why are you so concerned?
I thought of something.....
Just look at all those people.
I'm only trying to help you.
no you're wrong.
She's not there
This one has eyes.
Why did they leave your eyes?
Could you ever....
Would you like part of this?
It's not much.
What have you done Cut your hand?
What was that....
You have to!....
What kind of answer is that?
I need her!
I need her.
She needs me.
I've got to get to her.
He'll never find us.
and you're not lost now?
I was lost.
You should know better than that!
What is she doing to...
What am I to her or she to me?
I feel as if something odd were happening to me.
I did not accept any.
How could I be so wrong.
Hey that's the guy-
There out on a call perhaps I can help you-
Which one's which?
Yeah another round thing.
Stay to your left.
Tell me everything you feel.
Okay let's go in.
Good now the other side.
Cut him off.
Here do what I tell you.
He kept me straight.
Played the part too well.
So cut both.
it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
What not bad.
Just how easy is it to build a...
Top of my class at West Point thank you very much.
You tell me?
So what were they doing here?
Then let's go see what they missed.
She's not talking.
But she could be.
Anything else I should know?
Now wait just a fucking-
We've got one hour.
Alright let's check it out.
Exactly my thinking.
Call upstairs see what you can find out.
I was wrong...
Hey I'm next.
Then why tell me?
He's my brother...
We're moving' on.
Maybe she knows your old man.
I want to work this.
Nothing so far.
No thanks I'm fine.
Look it's important.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Take your time...
What was it this time?
When that happens you'll wish you had family.
that's a fish out of water.
So what'll you do?
You will one day at a time.
Next week we work the park.
Look who's talking old man.
So what're we looking for?
what're you doing?
You mean you just--?
You keep a record of...
It's about this.
We're five minutes-
Fire me later.
They had no business-
But I had to try.
What made you think you could get her to talk?
Report on the case so far.
I thought I told you--
Well have you found it?
I may lose it again?
She'll be down in a minute.
In a moment.
We'll continue later.
So I said to myself ""All right if he wants to look at them let him look at them.
"" And then he said ""Say ah.
"" And then I said ""Ah.
"" And that's all I remember...
That's just what I tried to tell him.
So we talked for about ten minutes.
I said ""Come in.
"" And there he was.
He said ""Good evening.
I'm the doctor.
"" I said ""Doctor?
"" He said ""Yes the doctor.
You see--  No no!
No I'm afraid...
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Now see here my good man.
You're looking fine Major.
Nice day Major.
I want to see--
How would you start?
Well that's not so easy.
You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.
Otherwise I'll call the police
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Two weeks and three days.
Three weeks I believe.
For more than forty years.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Now just a minute Major--
Good day Major.
Just as you say Doctor.
Well--  she's worth it!
I know you love me.
Come on--be brilliant.
This is real!
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three eight...
That's what I'm here for--to get out!
Sixty-five ninety-four--
You've to get out of here at once!
She may come back any minute.
Well you're three weeks too late!
How long will it take you?
Well we'll have to take what's here.
At twelve twenty.
We have to clear out.
Five seven and nine--
Oh no darling.
It's only ten days...
Let's open it--right now!
Let's get away from here!
And what of it?
But it's not enough!
Seven and nine!
Two fifty-three five--
And the day after tomorrow--
Now tell me--tell me all about yourself.
The whole thing is new to me.
And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
You know when I first saw you I thought you were an American.
You'd better not.
I would like to.
But you came.
He saw me.
Well shall I call the police?
But I expect the police to believe it.
And you expect me to believe that?
And you know who did it?
Seventy-six eighty--
No--thirty-five!
On the night table.
Then why do you want to go?
Any minute I want!
So you think you can get me?
Yes I would!
About me--about us?
The same thing.
First you lose your bag--
You think that's too much?
She must have been very happy here.
This used to be my secretary's room.
I should say around--seventeen thirty.
As you like.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
Do you know my first name?
Do you realize I have light eyes?
I tried it once--
That's what you need!
Not the major.
Shall we continue?
But you see it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
That's where I found it.
Then you go to the left.
Yes that's it!
Well the evening is still young.
Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
You see I wanted her to do something.
He is my secretary!
Where does he come from?
I was a school friend of your husband's...
You've got your money--
Let me give you a little advice.
Oh no no no no my dear child!
It'll be nice for your little brother too.
For all the really important things--
And he would have a little more time for--
Now if you could take over some of his work--
You see I have to get up very early.
My little brother goes to school--  You see Mother is dead.
Yes I saw it--but--
But you saw it here.
Yes my bag!
Then why did you do it?
An hour two at most.
but minutes only.
But not five.
from one to the next...
back and back.
And to you Mr.
Bottom left right.
I'll do this with or without your help sir.
You have to get to a boat right away!
And get to a boat quickly.
In an hour or so...
And I see it in your eyes.
About half actually.
But it was thought...
think about this a second.
So let me get this right.
A hundred and one next month.
If she'd've lived she'd be over a hundred now.
Who's the best?
Stay off the floor.
I'm in the sitting room.
She's out here for her own reasons God knows what they are.
I came down here to tell you to back off.
Look I'm running out of time.
Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
What can I do for you Mrs...?
What could possible be funny?
Stay with this one...
He seems to be quite...
Then that's our play.
There's no need for language Mr.
What do I tell your mother?
your mother and I have been looking for you --
Yes I lived.
Not the better half.
Oh Mother shut up!
not enough by half.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
But I was with him the whole time.
Now that one is back...
I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.
Something serious has happened.
Is it a --
what to do?
What did you think you were doing?!
What's his name again...?
I felt like black.
You told me to change.
One way or another.
Almost as good as you.
Good of you to come.
Never did like it much.
I'll miss you!
You know somebody?
Full house boys!
You lose my money??
look at that would ya.
It's your men back there!
We got plenty a' room for more.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
We got room for lots more.
I say we go back.
I'll show ya how it's done.
No but we're making excellent time.
I'll never let go.
Never let go.
that you will never give up...
no matter what happens...
Not this night.
Just a few more minutes.
Will this work?
You have to go for help.
Now it's worse.
I'm sure we're okay.
Where to Miss?
Will this light do?
I have to get back they'll miss me.
Only you can do that.
You're making this very hard.
Let me try to get this out.
But I'm involved now.
That was a long one.
You're not one of them.
Just move with me.
May I cut in miss?
Here it's easy.
I think I would.
even if we only ever just talk about it.
Yeah; it was great money...
But only in summer.
So then what Mr.
I see you.
You see people.
Just with her hands.
She had beautiful hands.
You used her several times.
Really they are.
It is that simple.
If only it were that simple.
Worse I'm afraid.
He is them.
It was them it was their whole world.
I just had to get away...
just run and run and run...
Not enough to get away from them.
They'll be sorry!
That's not what I was thinking.
What I was thinking was...
Look I know what you must be thinking!
I want to thank you for what you did.
Not just for...
So you got a name by the way?
Could I speak to you in private?
like that right down there...
To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
I'm involved now.
You would have done it already.
Now come on take my hand.
I'll let go.
Take my hand.
I'll pull you back in.
You think she was really there?
Can you give us something go on here.
And that makes you my new best friend.
Well that's the general idea my dear.
I can still feel its weight.
If you could have felt it not just seen it...
Just tell us what you can --
See the date?
Would you like anything?
There that's nice.
She takes care of me.
We're women.
And that name is the only card we have to play.
Of course I know it's gone.
You know the money's gone!
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Oh--a hundred times--
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
You mind your own business!
I can explain--
I'll join you later.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Shall I see you tomorrow?
for the rest of your life.
Here's to Europe!
I never want to go back....
I'm here with you...
How'd you ever get away with it?
It would be a nice change from you.
--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
We'll save you a place at our table.
That's a date.
See you again I hope.
About seven-thirty?
Yes yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.
I've heard of you back in New York.
Would you care to finish the game?
Will you pardon me?
I'm making it to you.
Could I see you a minute?
How about a little game later?
You're coming back--
And me coming in with two pair--
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Well I'm off to a pretty good start.
I'll see you all later.
Well I'll be--!!!
Make it five.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
What do you know about them?
--I won a little--
How much did you lose?
How well do you know her?
Yes--I remember--
Oh that's Mrs.
I think we ought to walk.
We'll let it go at that--
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
How about a little action?
--I know what I'm talking about.
Will you take some advice?
That's funny--so was I.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Anything I can do?
I'm sorry I'm late but something happened.
I'll be there--Good-by.
At seven-thirty?
Very--your mother?
--Good for you!
What a horrible death!
Nothing to speak of.
In fact--I think you're lovely.
Never eat before the show.
I'll be able to watch your act every night.
I could stand some more--
I'll say she is!
Yes--are you?
I thought you were one of my friends.
Want to take it back?
Say--wait a minute!
You keep it--
About sixteen hundred.
Oh is she?
You'll pardon me?
I'll take one.
Here's your twenty-five hundred Mr.
Here get this changed.
Quick let me have that money.

That goes two ways.
Much better--thank you--
Take the money Mr.
Here's your fifty.
Not a hundred though--just fifty.
Sure I'll go.
I'll go with you--
No--not quite.
I think I've met you before Mr.
At last you're making yourself useful.
I should say not.
She ought to be here any minute.
I thought you might know where she is--
Never mind--I'll pay for it now.
It'll save time.
That's my wife's name.
Next month is June.
Now we get it down to two words--""next month.
Back is in New York.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.
""Back in four weeks.
""Will--be--back--in--four--weeks.
"" Just say ""Back in four weeks.
I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
In New York.
That'll be seven twenty but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Here you are sir.
Well you got the first down--there's one more to go.
Come on we're ready to start right now.
She's in New York.
This is a fine time to be asking that.
Well did you find me?

Yes--Me--in person!
That's me!

Oh there you are--
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show Mr.
Well I've seen him here and there.
By the way--what do you know about him?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!
I'll never love anybody else.
Am I a member of this club?
Well that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
No--He's probably one of the ""Here's How.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What!
Somebody's got to do it--
Come on--I want to talk to you.
Will you let me have it?
--So that's it.
Does she know he's on board?
I went for four.
About twelve hundred.
Not a chance--I'm through.
I know he is.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
--you'd go with him!
Thanks to me.
All right--but what is there to face?
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
Say ""Thanks very much!
It all depends on what you're used to.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
There you are sir.
I'll explain later--
It seems too good to be true.
Then why did you run away?

I know that cut.
All right run 'em off.
Well in that case I saw your Horse.
They got Me good.
Our own brother.
You want to go fine.
I know I was wrong.
Who ever heard of That?
Get down boy.
I almost wish...
And nobody can make him.
Listen to me both of you.
This Is no good.
Do this and you throw it All away.
What about hell?
No Come on really do you?
Both of you!
Well how do we look?
That a fact?
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
We should get moving.
Talked it over.
That all right?
And I never even saw a horse like that.
They're nothing.
They're nobody.
Cold out there.
Look at 'em all.
How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Right over the head.
You'll never make that stick.
Here they are again.
Just the Same though...
Now there's six Of 'em.
You sure are.
Not If there's money in it.
Nothing to do with me?
Talk to him will you?
Or hit him.
That's the real money.
Here's Where I leave you.
So to speak.
Well we're off and running.
Just like any other hard cases.
Well that's your problem.
Well here we are a family again.
You're So lovely.
Just at your feet.
Too bad nice place.
It's too late -
Take the girl.
Now both of you.
And what's that my dear?
Look at the time!
Words to live by?
Perhaps I should buy it for a book!
And still not a thing to watch.
Said I'd never amount to anything but...
I turned it into this
So why did you leave?
Still I do miss her.
I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
We live in the information age!
A piece of advice Mr.
I want you to meet my wife.
You might say I've always been one of Mr.
He is a she -  at the bar.
Actually I've never known you to do either...
Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch...
Enjoy your meeting?
We've got to stop meeting like this.
They may be on to us.
I'm sure she is James.
And do try to keep all four of them on the road.
Your new car.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means?
I know what I saw -
I've heard all about you sir.
Get them out of here.
I'll see you in twenty minutes.
Just - say it.
Say it just once.
I'm so sorry James.
It's on the boat.
Do you feel better now?
I know you still love -
I've missed you -
Is that any way to say hello?
In fact I was never here.
What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Not from forty feet.
It must do something.
I know better than that -
I'm not certain...
Wait a minute -  I've got it.
How could they get this far off course?
I won five hundred -  What happened?
I have to get these to London.
We do what we can.
Where did you get the boat?
Let's take a look at the body.
Hey - the world is my office.
Depends what number you write.
Does this do anything?
Interesting video tape.
And when might that be?
And number two?
Before we go any further here Mr.
Did I miss something???
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Sometimes you just have to -
We have time for that?
Sit up on it.
What the hell does that do?
Not a lot of difference.
My father left me the business.
He was my father's best friend!
I left mine in the car.
- You're not.
If I were you -
And what do you call this?
Do I have to do everything around here?
Nice to run into you again.
I see my date is here.
And exactly what business are you in Mr.
Actually I'm here on business.
You might say it was a...
Bring him whatever he wants.
I'm waiting for my dinner date.
And another for you?
I have an excellent teacher.
Actually you're just in time.
Sorry I'm late -
I hate to ask but...
You know the Minister?
We've already done the interesting part.
Do you forget?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
And what do you call these?
Indeed they are.
I got here first.
Aye-aye sir.
A dead head.
Seems to be back to normal sir.
How is it now?
Check it again.
The back-up does the same thing.
It's doing it again.
- I told you!
He was there!
I see you two have met.
What is HE doing here?
You come with me -  You stay here.
Take the men.
You have to leave -
In fact Mr.
Get somebody up there!
Get more men up there!
This is not true!!
Will it go off?
What's in the box General?
What's in the box???
Who is that?!?
What's in the box??
They're too big.
Oh here we go with that.
He is supposed to spend some time with you.
No it's that when do you have time to be parents to him?
Spend some time trying to be parents.
You ought to let him get to know nature.
We got the same thing.
What did your wife get her?
I pay my own way.
It's after one.
We will take her.
You all stay here and watch Dad.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
You call me boy in front of my wife.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
This is what it is all about trying to keep from being out on the street.
We see him from time to time.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
You always got something to say.
Do you think you won?
You were in hell?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Go back to your friends.
If you really care about me just tell me how I can make money.
He is just being like all parents concerned about the ones they love.
Why does he always pick on me?
But if there is a way...
Will you still get the money from your father?
What would I talk about?
Coffee is bad for anybody especially for a child.
The world is not black and white.
Well you look better than you did yesterday.
He will be alright.
It gets cold at night.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Come with us boy.
Maybe something is wrong.
Look at this card.
Boy that is the real South.
The lights went out.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Now how far would further out be?
Well you just have to move further out.
What choice do people like us have.
But these are white people anybody.
"" He asked ""What's you'll doing?
What did you put on it?
Since this morning.
When was I sick?
You better come sit down.
You are still sick.
What are you having another party?
How is the garden doing?
You must have been really sick.
It's good to be able to hear that.
I will see to them.
Just stay in bed and rest.
Son you make me wish I was dead.
No I'm too hot now.
It's cold out here.
It would be nice.
You're always taking his side.
Your feet are cold.
Everyone is gone.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died.
I was always boy to him.
You still call him boy.
but at the end you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.
You worked your whole life for what?
Oh I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you.
That used to be my trade from time to time.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Man act like this is your home.
Stay until you feel better?
I would like to hear all the news.
I had to get off and take a rest.
Only if you are a good man a friend.
Are you a friend?
I have to know who is in my house.
If you are made to feel half a man what do you think the other half is?
You must have done something to her.
Good afternoon to you.
How is he doing?
Let me get you a cup?
You just run along.
He will be all right.
He is usually up and at it the next day.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
How is everybody?
Could all of you go in the other room?
You got to know everything do everything and be everything.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Everything is in what you call it not in what it is.
Where we come from you had to know how to act right.
You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir.
You had to know your place.
One can tell you are from back home.
You should go back and rest.
Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Now who are we talking about?
There is something that I always wanted to know.
Hey you have to think of yourself.
There are too many bad people out there.
Well you and your husband are special.
I already have my dear.
Now I was trying to be nice to make conversation since we go back some.
You know the saying ""your heart is in your left hand.
I'm in church now.
That is not too much to ask.
That's why I do not eat over there now.
Did you have your child at home?
In some things.
This is family business and we have to pull together.
I want to hear what happened.
You know the man next door is near death.
Which one can I open first?
Now what did I tell you?
Right where you left them.
In the car!
Oh great you found them.
Where were they?
Everybody say ""Bye house.
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.
Where was the last place you left him?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
I'll even let you drive.
You'll find him.
I know I left him right there.
Well sure we can leave it up.
What are you doing over there?
Well sure look at him.
Oh hey - it was nothing.
No no no no...
We've got to get out of here...
Now let's get you out of this thing.
I thought you were --
You must not be thinking clearly.
What's the difference.
Come on this way!
Out the window...
I am Mrs.
I think you've had enough tea for today.
How are you doing that?
It should be good for hours --
Oh great great.
I just saw it!
No one will see us there.
And when we get there we'll be able to find a way to transport you...
Then we've no time to lose!!
Just down there.
We've got trouble!
I could have stopped him.
You mean that happy child?
I'd better take a look anyway.
Oh no no no...
"" Oh all this time I thought it was an act!
He's mine and no one is taking him away from me.
All right then I will.
Stand back everyone!
Okay then Mr.
You're clear to come up.
Well let's see we've got double A's --
So you see?
Oh let me!
Turn 'em around turn 'em around!
I hate to break up the staff meeting but THEY'RE HERE!
That's what we're made for.
Hey watch it!
Whatever she says it's not true!
Give her back now!
I'm telling!
No she's NOT --
She's sick!
Here I come here I come --
Now we'll never know what it is!
No no no wait!
What are you trying to pull?!
He's with me!
And now you want to let him back over here?
I got a better idea!
Who is it this time?
Well obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.
Where'd ya go?
This is serious!!
What's taking them so long?!
A mean one?
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
It's too short!
Who's up there with you?
There's a nice little one over there!
They're getting bigger.
Back to your places.
So did I tell ya?
Well done men.
It's a big one...
Okay we're on the last present now...
Ah ha ha ha...
Ha ha oh I love you too.
In a couple of days everything will be just the way it was.
They'll see...
they'll see.
I've got some bad news.
well alright you can be red if you want.
I'm red this time.
Nothing is left but us.
Everything is gone now.
So had I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I already lost everything once.
How long has -
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Surely she is older?
Did you now.
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
I've got a present for you...
I finished it off.
You <i>are</i> cold.
Ah come on now!
Can I come into bed with you for a little while I feel terrible.
Living with him put years on me.
You're not so old yourself!
You're only a young thing.
Night comes on.
What about school?
She'll have to learn.
Home is where the heart is.
It's a lot to take in all at once.
He made that.
In his off hours.
She got away.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I carried you up to your bed.
I did like the music.
There's not.
You'll put your clothes here.
In the play.
Well not <i>that</i> much older.
I'm not too young.
We're too young.
They should have taken us.
Well nearly sixteen.
You're well built; how old are you?
I mean did you ask her?
He's lucky he lived.
Consider it gone away.
I want to believe you.
What is he planning on telling them?
Why does he need money?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
He never came home last night.
Was he with you?
What happened to what they gave you?
It's the same stuff?
I know I made things worse.
Something only you can help me with.
This is out of your hands.
Stay out of things.
Let us try to win the case.
And I will continue to try.
That was a stupid thing you did.
I've always had a man in my life.
Church and State.
How much do I pay him?
How do I get through this?
I am on the board of my son's school.
Now go home and be with your children.
Continue your life as if nothing has happened.
That is very important.
Why are you talking like that?
You move into my house.
I was just waiting for the right time.
I'm coming right now --
Why does this happen to someone?
How does it happen?
About the other night I'm sorry.
Should we bring the police into this?
Oh it is?
She asked me not to.
I talked with her.
How long have you known?
Space for what?
I'm not part of that group.
I mean what would you have done if you had been us?
Is this bad for him?
Did you tell Dad?
Sorry but I mean come on.
Did you meet the President?
I want our life back.
Do you have any idea what is happening out here?
Nobody will help us.
Nobody will take us in.
Nobody wants anything to do with us.
I'll make it up to you --
Or if you're coming back.
How's David?
I got that.
Just watching you.
Oh yes I can.
You're getting help somewhere.
Okay young lady that's it.
How long's the job?
Has anybody talked about that?
What else you do?
I get A's.
All A's.
I'm third in my class.
One day a week for two hours.
Do you work?
Parents still together?
Live with your parents?
I've only got maybe an hour.
Open it talk about your kids.
What do you think she wants?
I love my job.
Are you getting this on tape?
We got you on tape making the deal.
We got you.
Nothing to read.
Depends on the state.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.
Depends who it's from.
We're playing!
I'll put this in the back.
Get out of the car and do it.
This is your chance.
There's always a way.
There may not be a way.
A few people get high who are getting high anyway.
That thought makes me feel awful.
Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.
Some get stopped.
Enough get through.
It's not difficult.
So it's worth the wait right?
Bring this man a change of good clothes.
And we have a deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
Take this back with you.
I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test.
It should be...
That's nothing new.
Perhaps I remember something.
My husband had been working on something he called The Project for the Children.
Are you aware of this?
That is not true Mrs.
Why do you say that Mr.
No this is not possible.
No but a lot of other people.
You should come out with us.
I was just with everybody we work with.
Your new friends.
Everything's back to normal.
If you want her to stay out of it then stop telling her everything.
What's he doing up here?
You should feel good about this.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
It's important that we work together.
Then we get them and they too will give us names.
You watch and learn.
Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
He'll do what I say.
A small thing.
What is it you want me to do?
That's your past.
I want to talk about your future.
How did you find about this?
It could mean that yes.
Maybe it's already happening.
I mean how would we know?
So we have a better idea who we're looking for.
Any way we can do it better?
Now it's almost double.
What do you look for?
Any idea how much?
Just tell me where she is.
I want your money I'll take your money.
I have money --
This is a business.
She comes here.
To this place.
What's that shit?
You want to help?
Hey man I'm sorry.
The West End.
Two people really similar we can talk about anything but for me it's like a weekend thing then I get my shit together and for her it's different --
Can you tell me anything?
Do you have any ideas?
She's not at that place you sent her?
Yes I hope so as well.
If we're moving the press conference we need to do it now.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
I just want to be clear about one thing.
I used to work for him but now I work for you.
It's important that they like you.
It's not important that they like me.
It's three a.
I'm not supposed to be here.
What kind of research?
He's a research doctor.
You're dad's a doctor too --
Your dad's a doctor.
We need a doctor.
Right see when I come back --
I'll be right after you.
Well I've not brought them.
On you go.
You were in my way.
I want the money Mark that's all.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
The guy's sorry.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
That's what -- Ten years' worth?
Two thousand one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Yes you fucking do.
I've seen your statement.
Let's face it it could have been wonderful.
Five pounds to win.
Can you not go yourself.
Too right it is.
So what's he like?
Sixteen next month.
And what age are you?
So why have you told me about it?
It's so simple.
I put up two.
I come away with six.
The point is you've got to find something new.
I mean the guy's dead anyway.
Too young for what?
In that case you can do it.
You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
think I left something back at the -
Well what's wrong boy?
It's where I live.
I thought to myself: she's special.
Did I tell you about my birthday?
You can imagine what happened.
It'll be here somewhere.
I'm an old boy myself you know?
But obviously I am.
Here that is.
I hope I'm not talking too much.
There's no need for you to get you ""foot in the door"" as you put it.
Only to get my foot in the door.
Like which school?
Could be six could be one but that's not important.
What's important is that I am right?
That I am.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No problem for me either.
There's no need.
I'll take them home and bring them back.
Sorry about last night -
You take the test?
Are you getting out much?
Would not say no would not say no.
And you might get the fucking job.
But try too hard --
If they think you're not trying you're in trouble.
We're two thousand short.
What was your price?
Wants rid of this.
Get you a good price.
It was my fucking television.
I got a good price for it.
I'm getting on with life.
It's easy money for me.
You're all hear.
Bad news big deal.
Have you been to see him yet?
God you're sick.
Did he -- you know?
Say something Mark say something --
Sick Boy's?
So who else?
No it's not bad but it's not great either is it?
Well at one time you've got it and then you lose it and it's gone for ever.
But you're looking better it has to be said.
You can look it up.
He never wrote any of them.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
You Only Live Twice?
After all we're not fucking stupid.
And the reasons?
There are no reasons.
And see when I get out of here.
No fucking problem.
you'll need one more hit.
Yeah well it surely worked for him.
Does that answer your question?
There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
This had better be good.
We go for a walk.
That's fair enough.
Let's put it behind us.
Where did she come up with that?
How long is it?
For me it's the best or nothing at all.
Seems to me like it's gone pretty well.
No no it's not possible.
Why have you done this to my friend?
You are the first to find me.
It was not.
It is I.
The sun's come out!
You'll never live it down.
You have no authority.
All right we're lost.
But we're making good time.
We're lost.
No but you can bet they will.
There are more of us than you know.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
The power was within you.
Where did you get this power?
I might be able to take two of you.
I gave you three.
I lost a brother once.
I got him back.
I've lost a brother.
Maybe he's right here...
The only problem is it's up there.
We're down here.
end of word.
I'm a little out of practice.
Until then you're either with me or you're not.
That he's found it.
Is what possible?
This er person...
There's got to be a way out of this place.
He's sorry See he's sorry.
that makes everything all right.
He's sorry everything's...
For that I'm sorry.
I have a half brother.
I do not have a brother.
You mean he's your brother brother?
You made that up!
You do not understand.
You stay out of this!
If you think it would help.
Let me do something.
Be one with the horse.
I do not often think of the past.
Perhaps I have.
You can call me Jim.
Doctor if you please.
I've always known...
No special conditions?
Given to me by God.
Now learn something about yourself.
I've done nothing.
This is who they are.
What have you done to my friends?
I free them.
I'm afraid of nothing.
Are you afraid to hear me out?
We must change our course at once.
You're back with us.
So I brought us dinner.
This is my doing.
Since that time I have found myself and my place.
I know you better than that.
In fact, I'm just getting started.
Something very big.
Oh, that is beautiful.
I know, I met him.
is the evidence.
We now take you to three months later.
You did break in.
I'm certainly not.
I mean not that often -
I mean I want both of us to go.
You call that getting over it?
I want to go to his place.
Oh I wish you'd forget about that.
It was all so long ago.
I'm not interested in talking about him.
They'll start to soon enough.
Well we should have you running again in a couple of days I hope.
No no I'm sure but -- you understand.
It should only be a couple of days.
What's the thing you're working on?
great piece of work.
What's our next move?
Right on the money!
only yes and no...
That all you can say?
So do as I tell you.
If you think -
Now wait a minute -- I wrote you.
End of line.
I would if I could find it.
out of my range.
Oh I know all that.
They may be...
may I pass?
Not us I hope.
I mean in here.
How about over there...
What just the three of us?
Where did you hear that name?
Let's get some power here.
It's too far!
What's wrong with that area?
Boy the view from up here...
That's normal when they transport you.
It'll come back to you.
You're doing real well in training.
Yeah yeah -- that's great.
worked at a big insurance company.
what were you...
you know before?
You're getting out of the business?
Not much chance of that now.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that.
He must know what you're up to.
Which I've got every reason as you well know...
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
You never were much for small talk.
She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
We'll get them sir...
Then pull yourself together.
I need that...
I'm worth a couple million of their man-years!
in the other world.
So I brought him down here...
let him hope for a while...
that interest you?
that comes first.
Do you know what he's talking about?
You think we can make it there?
They'd better be...
you really think they're still there?
As long as it gets us out of here
I had to...
Why is everything...
everybody looks so dead...
I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
I should never have told you about him.
Just an hour?
Can you cover me for an hour?
I have a book report.
Where are you off to young lady?
Tell your father I may be late.
It is true!
He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.
But it's not fine.
Nothing's fine.
Dad how come you know the words?
You know you can always talk to me.
You seem fine now.
I was there!
You have six minutes.
Do we know where she is?
here's what we got.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
Any minute now.
I thought this look like your work.
It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
We're dead right?
You must work for us.
There is only one more question.
You know about that?
You tell on me I tell on you.
But be a man here--
Where's page ten?
Give me the page.
He could be working her to get to you.
Yeah and we do it twenty times a day.
Her office line and the line at my house.
We have that.
You'll get used to it after a --
Same thing happened to me with wife two.
What kind of person would think of that?
I'll just hang then shall I?
Just hang a minute.
You want me to just hang--?
Can we go to the office now Mr.
He's all over the place.
Stay on him.
There's another guy still in the car.
Want me to lose them?
She says she's got something for me.
I own a--
It's all set up...
You better watch it.
Three four nine nine one.
I moved back in.
I thought you moved out.
Twenty here fifty there...
She's only fourteen.
She's only -- how old is she?
* of where we were at the same age.
Here check these out.
What a team.
See you at eight.
Okay pick me up at eight.
The dad thing.
Where are you!
You're on the air.
And I have to get home to my family.
My husband is a good man.
So it was your first time.
Is this a common thing for you?
I wanted to see what would happen.
I should have gone to the police I suppose.
Say that now.
When I see something I want I have to have it.
Is that why you got into this business?
I love this place.
It's certainly...
They want something...
Well what's the point of waiting?
Call me if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Do you like the period?
But we'll find him.
If you have to use this use it.
As much as you used to?
Do you still love me?
But I wanted to.
Have you had to...
Is it working yet?
What did he give you?
Then where did I get this?
He's got nothing to do with this.
It's me you want right?
I can do it!
No one must know!
Of course yes!
What's involved?
Can I go home please?
Do you still love your husband?
Answer the question--
Let me out of her!
I wanted to do something...
it felt good to be needed.
To be special.
What did you need?
And you agreed?
You're in a lot of trouble Mrs.
What kind of questions are these?
I suppose he is.
Well maybe a little.
He needed my help.
Why did you continue to see him?
Three days later he called me.
What did happen?
or whatever his name is...
a couple of weeks ago.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Did is work out okay?
They said you had to run out.
They must've just missed me.
I was in the area and I thought you might like to have lunch.
I'll just be a second.
So what happened tonight at the office?
Thank you for the party.
Baby I said I'd be there.
It's not okay.
You should have seen it.
How'd it go at the trade show?
You got the wrong guy.
Look just let me go.
Hold it a day for me?
You and this car were meant for each other.
she's pretty good in bed then?
But with you she gets to be hot right?
You working on someone right now?
* business I'd be out of business know what I mean?
Use 'em and lose 'em.
I like change.
Well think of it as playing a role.
Okay just ask yourself.
What do women really want?
Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.
I can be honest.
And you've got one.
But it's not enough.
What're we talking about here?
well okay then.
I'll run out right now.
I said SIT DOWN.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Who's your little friend?
I have to think...
Can you get away?
Just for two days.
What is it you need me to do?
You'll call me then?
For your safety.
Right of course.
See you're very good.
That was you?!
The same place.
Remember I need you.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
He wants to speak with you.
Did you get the letter?
We'll be there some time tomorrow.
He said you were his best friend.
It is what I want.
It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be.
It's got a nice ring to it.
I think what you did...
I think what you did was...
But to be honest I put myself in that position.
Was it him or you?
Not when it comes to shit like this.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
No no no no no no no no no...
Are there others Mr.
Oh by the by Mr.
Will you be my wife?
And again and again and again.
At the bus station.
But I've only been there about four days.
Is he nice?
He thinks he is.
Is he black?
In fact it's stupid not to ever see you again.
Yeah that one.
I'm a call girl.
There's a difference ya know.
Maybe there's not.
You check up on the box office girls.
I was paid to be there.
Did I do something?
So she said no.
"" So she did and he asked her and she said yes.
What would make you think that?
You know when you sat behind me?
How old were you then?
He was just born remember?
This is the first one.
Well I thought about that even before I heard him say it.
Well we sell other things too.
Shit like that.
How much is that worth?
Do you get paid a lot?
It's easy work.
Almost four years.
How long have you worked here?
So that was no help.
So I told him to stop and I got out.
I'm not sure yet.
Ask me again later.
Girl group stuff.
But off the top of my head I'd say black.
But I'm not sure yet.
Where are you from.
Ask me them again.
One by one.
Where're ya from?
It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
I'll walk you to it.
That's my real name really.
Is that your real name?
Pleased to meet ya.
They take him into the police station.
Does a number on him.
Oh look what happened.
Oh god I'm so sorry.
And here we are.
And so there you go.
Now hang up.
And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow all of your money problems are over.
Tell him I love him.
And tell him as of tomorrow all his money problems are over.
Tell him to look through it.
Ya looked through it?
Has he looked through it yet?
The letter he sent.
The letter I sent.
Tell him not to eat anything.
Hope to see you again real soon.
Nothing's open.
Now what would you do.
He like it too.
Take that shit somewhere else.
I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
If I thought I could get away with it -
You'd really do that?
Live with what?
Can you live with it?
Want some dinner?
I'm her husband.
This is our last chance to play ""what if"".
Well I mean this is our last chance to think about it.
Do you really mean it?
I know that Richard.
You got yours?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
He could use it.
He could afford it.
I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
How difficult can that be?
Yeah they do.
But most of the people I know are like me.
I certainly hope so.
It'll get ya high.
For the very first time in my life.
Do you know what that's like?
Every word of it.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
That comes later.
I did real well.
What are women like out here?
Ask him if he got the letter.
I'm not quite sure how I did it.
I'd hate to have to do it again.
But I did it.
Well there's a story behind all that.
I'll tell you when I see you.
It's great to hear from you.
What's waiting for us up there.
They'll be along.
Where's everybody else?
He wants everybody there.
He'll talk to you.
Yeah he's good.
He wants to talk ya.
Have a ball it's his money.
What else would I be talking about?
The police department?
No really where does it come from?
Like look at her.
Man I was ever wrong.
I'd like to use the little boy's room.
He just saw his chance and he took it.
But I'm not in that position.
I need to know if we're in bed together or not.
I love you son.
I got some money I can give you -
Thanks a lot Daddy.
You really came through for me.
Name mean anything to you?
They have nothing.
Everybody else did.
You're not really very good at it.
But I know you love me.
What makes you think I would do that?
What makes you think I could do that?
You can tell I'm in love with her.
It's written all over it.
Ya know what?
She seems very nice.
I'm really not very -
That's about all I ever eat.
Oh probably not.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
It's written.
That is a fact.
You know I read a lot.
Especially things that have to do with history.
I got one.
I have a son of my own.
About you boy's age.
Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself.
Shit are you behind.
Is he a nice guy?
You think he'll help me out?
Where'd he come from?
Could we try it now?
If we decided on making him a New York type could you do that?
That was very good.
And what you're trying to do is get him off.
I'm me...
I mean that's me.
We talked him into it.
He just told you so himself.
He knows something's up.
You do more than try.
To front for him.
We got it man.
And it's all ours.
You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here.
She's done it before.
He must of thought it was white boy day.
"" Now what do you say?
It's so funny oh it's so funny.
Please they'll be here any minute.
You must be high.
I fucking knew it!
But I heard him say.
I heard he was in town.
Yeah I live here.
Do you know where we can find him?
There'd be no point.
whatever you call it...
I just want to do my part.
To get us back on top...
And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
I WANT TO BE WELL!
Women will want to get to know you...
You saw that man?
We want you to tell us about last night.
This is it, James...
what you've been working for.
We're very close!
You're still a little...
For a man in your position...
We've had some...
Have it taken away?
I got into trouble.
I think it was...
I think you were here too.
looked just like you look now.
They may be looking for us James.
Maybe it's...
I know this place!
That's what they were up to!
I feel I've known you before.
I feel I've always known you.
Well you look pretty different too.
But maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe you're wrong.
Funny it's like what's happening to us like the past.
They played it for me.
No people from the future.
do you remember...
six years ago...
you had a phone number!
You tried to call and...
I want to be here.
In this time.
I want to become...
become a whole person.
I want this to be the present.
How did it get there?
What does this mean to you?
Where a boy...
The boy in the well.
One minute you were there the next minute you were gone.
it's in my mind.
I thought I was in...
No I want to turn myself in.
I want to get well...
I can live here.
I lost it
If I'm wrong about everything...
the world will be okay.
I need help all right.
They're coming after me.
I would love to believe that.
It was my idea?
What made you think that?
See -- you can drive after all!
You have to give yourself up you know.
That has your name on it.
It was some kind of...
Turn off here.
I said I was too young to drive.
You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
All I see are dead people.
What's three more?
I've got one now.
Oh Jesus James!
He's from the present.
But you need help James.
None of this is what you think it is.
Hey turn left here.
Thinking about that little boy in the well?
What will you do...
when you find this...
I've told you about them.
No I think it was always you.
what's happening.
And I was in it?
before everything happened.
And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.
Your hair was different but I'm sure it was you.
Can we hear that one?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?
Something so bad...?
Is that all the music?
""If something really happens""...
like what James?
My father told me that.
something really happens.
In this city...
You used to call me ""James"".
Does it play music?
You told me you'd help me.
I can read remember?
Have you been...
Six years for you.
I have to do this James.
It's not the right number yet.
I have the...
a long time ago perhaps.
Were you ever...?
Was it around here?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
It was some lady.
That's the future James.
Do you think you're living in the future?
What year do you think it is?
Do you know what year it is?
What's wonderful about the air James?
I love this air.
This is wonderful air.
Do you know why you're here James.
I need to go.
No not possible.
Listen I have to get out of here.
I'm supposed to be getting information.
but I do want to help you.
Can you do that James?
May I call you ""James""?
I need to go now.
Send you to the future?
I'm supposed to report in to them.
They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Who would you call Mr.
Does this bother you Mr.
You're fucking with my head!
This is your old plan right?
The police are looking for me.
I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
For the future!
I am a new person!
I just want some information...
County Hospital right?
Why thank you -- you look wonderful too.
Twelve of them.
You do know me.
Listen up -- try and get it together.
I did my part.
What're you writing?
You know -- your plan.
That's a great idea!
LIKE A PERSON!
I'm all taken care of see?
I've sent out word.
Of course not I never thought you were.
Get you out?
Along comes this doctor...
What is this guy...
A telephone call?
But that's not why you're here.
It's all right there.
What are we for then?
That's a fact!
I need to make a telephone call.
What'd they give you?
They gave you a pardon man.
Hey five minutes ago thirty years ago!
Yes that phone call.
I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that...
Here take it man!
The call I just made?
Five minutes ago?
The phone call man.
You're the one!
They gave you a pardon!
But you know what's real now?
You sent me to the wrong year!
Did you make that call?
Right now we want to know everything that you saw.
You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
What else do you want me to say?
That woman is...
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
just in case.
That's everything we got.
You want me to go in with you?
You said he gave a name...
You want to go in?
Were you listening?
We got two officers in the hospital.
Still on his feet.
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.
All they got was his name.
You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Same back at you.
Afraid of it?
We all got through it all right.
Think you'll live that long?
What do you want for free?
I think I've heard that before.
Or maybe you just think you do.
I can see just fine.
He's only just dead.
What was I supposed to do with him?
And nobody wants to take him for me.
He looks sick.
All right old man.
You want my change?
You got change?
Yeah I want something.
You want something old man?
That's my morning's pay.
It's got no day or date.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
I'll take a piece of that bet.
You got two years on me.
What's that make me?
Hundred and eight already.
I'll give you the money!
I'll give you two-fifty.
Just a little short.
I just wanted to get out that's all.
That was two- fifty.
Twenty-seven fifty.
That's where I have to go.
But in particular?
I run an honest business.
I want my car.
oh it's you.
Come back when the sun comes up.
It is morning.
Come back in the morning.
Yeah you better remember that.
I'm taking my car and I'm taking it now!
As soon as I get my money.
You think bad and bad is what you get.
Now that's too bad.
She's all yours.
Look I just want to pick up my car.
You got to be more careful.
what the hell happened to you.
Just a car.
And be careful with her will you?
I remember one time--
I remember one time.
Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Twenty-after-ten.
How you planning on getting it there?
What did I just tell you?
Never seen it so hot.
You want to take a look at my car?
Will he be back soon?
He's up at the Look Out.
Yeah I'll try.
Now look at what you done!
Let me get your change.
Now she died.
There you go Mrs.
Just put it in there.
What do you think boy?
Now how much did you get?
Same thing you want.
But that takes money.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?
He made me come with him.
Is that the way you want it boy?
I know I've had my fill of this town.
Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.
I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
That yours Mrs.
If it is someone they'll go away.
Or call the police.
There's someone in the house.
What the hell you looking at girl?
They look nice.
You never said anything.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.
Who the hell is this!?
I thought you would be at work dear.
Do you hear me John!?
Yeah they'll find you.
Someone will find me.
Walk to where?
Walk away and leave you here.
But it's nice to know you care.
But I want to say with you
If we can even make that.
And it's a big difference.
But you said we could be together.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?
He was to take the fucking money.
It's our money.
He had no right to take it.
Thirty-thousand that's all.
We would have been free and clear.
He was there and he let it happen.
That's all talk.
He's got nothing on us.
A little more.
You wanted him dead.
I wanted no part of it.
If that's not good enough for you then I'd be happy to open it.
Might buy us some time.
Put some clothes on him.
It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
To get my car.
Get it and put the money in it.
Never needed one.
Let him watch.
Let's do it here.
Let's go in the bedroom.
I knew it was there.
I know it's here!
This is real good.
It's got to be here.
There's nothing under here but more floor.
That's fucking brilliant!
I'm not sure where it is.
I just heard him talk about it.
But I've had nothing but time to think about it.
But we've got to get the money baby.
We get the money I get the car then we get the hell out.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.
Before I even knew about the money.
About me I mean?
There's only one way to do that.
Is that what changed your mind?
I'm getting out of here and I want to take you with me.
I've thought about you every second since I left.
There is no us remember?
I wanted to talk.
Is there something you wanted?
Listen to yourself!
It's not like he's a young man.
He's had time to live.
Is it so bad?
It would be quick.
I mean all the time.
Just something he said.
One-hundred-thousand!?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
How much money has he got?
You live pretty good.
He's got money.
We take it.
I know where we could get the money.
I just want to get out of here.
Is it pretty?
Whatever it takes.
I mean I would.
do things for him.
Do you hate me for it?
But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
You just walk away.
You could just leave him.
All this nothing?
Depends on what you call love.
He's not much; he's older than me different than me but he's got more money than half this town put together.
I wanted him.
I wanted what he could give me and I would've done anything to get him.
Is that love?
Did you ever?
Yeah but I like the sun.
That's about the only way.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
You never did answer my question.
But you already know that.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.
Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
And what game did you want to play?
I have ideas.
Now what should we do?
I was sick of looking at this room.
I think they add a little life.
You can let go of me now.
How do they look.
The same thing you do.
My face tell you all that?
You must be good.
Those are white words not ours.
From my father.
Where'd you learn to do that?
A little of this a little of that.
What do you do anyway?
Did you like it; me watching you?
I saw you watching me.
I'd just pick up do whatever I had to do and get out.
I've never been anywhere else.
Went to the state fair.
What happens if you lose?
Business to finish.
I might be able to pick up some work there.
You've been around.
Where you coming from?
Maybe they never would have found you.
Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Thank you John.
You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Had them long as I can remember.
It's down a ways.
I could drive up.
No trouble at all really.
It's very nice of you to help me.
You should be more careful.
No I've got it.
Do you have to call me that?
See how easy it is for us to get to know each other beautiful?
That's right on my way.
Can I give you a hand beautiful?
How do you think I got in here?
How did the evening end?
It's not me you have to worry about.
She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Not from where I stand.
What man would?
What are you.
You're not talking sense.
Then maybe this afternoon.
Now you make straight for it.
Give me two- hundred.
But I need the money.
I've got to have the money.
That's a lot of talk.
A whole lot of talk.
Not for money for a girl.
Not twice in one day.
You came to take my wife from me?
There's another reason?
That's not the reason I'm here.
Or maybe two-thousand.
Or twenty-thousand.
Who's to stop you?
Just listen to me--
And where'd you plan on getting the money from?
He did more work on the car.
You could say.
Trouble with the car again?
Yeah well me too.
You're an honest man.
All I have in the world.
You think that's a lot of money?
Had you done it.
I hate the kind of her person she is.
But I love her too much to do otherwise.
You love her but you hate her?
I know all right.
From that you'd just turn and walk away.
Is the job done?
I went to your place.
We talked just like you told me.
And tell her what?
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
It should be.
You want to do this yourself?
I got no choice but to do business with you.
It's thirteen or it's nothing.
I need thirteen.
And that's a maybe.
How much could you get?
Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Just to get out of here?
Let's say I do want her dead.
And what does that make you?
You meant it.
You're the one who brought it up.
In your car.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.
About what you said this morning.
About your wife.
Now what can I do for you?
I do all right.
Nice office you've got.
I had a problem getting my car back.
You've really got to be more careful.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Would I what?
She does at that.
A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?
What are you to do eh?
That'd be the life.
I know a man who's got a boat.
You've got to be--
Is this what it's all about?
But if you're not I think I'll be on my way.
I have half a mind to--
A lot that means.
I met her in town.
Now who the hell are you and it better be good or God help me I'll break you in half.
I said come on!
I want to stay.
We got man's business to take care of.
What were you doing with my girl?
We was just talking.
Will you shut up!
What's your name anyway?
What I want is for.
I saw your car over at the gas station.
Not yet that is.
I just wanted to thank you.
You're too quick for me.
How about I pick one out for you?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You got a quarter?
This means something to you?
You never have to see me again.
Now what's this?
Would you please tell him?
You better be afraid.
I was making time with your girl.
That's not the way it looked to me.
Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
A hundred and.
A hundred-forty-five really.
I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
The old lady?
And that's not the half of it.
I know Mr.
I was on my way to you it's just.
what a day I've had.
And you're taking?
And hell you did all the work.
What'd you think boy?
How much did you get?
It's a wonder the Mrs.
You picked the wrong people.
Like I said; I been watching you.
Especially you boy.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
No problems up the road.
Oh yes I heard all about that.
Nice night for a drive.
Stay as long as you like son.
Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Not as bad as it looks.
You're not from around here.
He is at that.
Wait until I'm gone.
Be seeing you old man.
You got to ask yourself: is it worth it?
Then you better know what it is you're doing.
Now it's a woman?
It's all the same to me.
Everybody's got a mother.
I was there when I lost them.
I lost them in the war.
Be careful boy.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Up at the mine.
Took my eyes.
Well he's right.
And everything is nothing too.
And everything is everything.
Just another small town.
You go big town.
I'll see ya later unless I come across something worse.
Now can you go away?
Then maybe you should've.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Give me two-hundred.
But I need the the money.
You have a lot of talk in you whole lot of talk.
Next time you'll do just fine.
Tell her you had to see her.
Maybe the only thing she does love.
I got to figure this thing.
Well looks like we got ourselves a contract.
I'm not your boy.
I hate the kind of person she is.
But she's family.
She's my little girl.
How much you want?
You're the one brought it up.
Say what happened to your hand?
It's a funny thing women.
Too hot to be walking...
What I want is for...
When I work on a car I work on a car.
I'll get you your money.
What am I suppose to do?
got no day got no date.
No sir I'll stick with this.
Actually it's been about three hours.
Had to put a new one in.
What the hell happened to my car?
Hands is important.
Course half hour from now might be seventy-two.
And love's a funny thing.
Go get it throw it down.
Can you make it back up?
But we all need that too.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Please I really want to be with you.
When you're finished with me I'm next!
I been there baby.
If we can make that.
After that you're on your own.
Your mother your father what story are you on now?
I believe in this moment that's all.
I think nothing happens.
Was I fucking my own Daddy?
Let it go baby.
It's the past.
I got a past...
Ask you what?
Those two they were the same.
He would've done what you wanted you could've made a deal and...
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
I've read all about it.
Where should we go?
But I thought --
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I'm not coming back.
Buy us some time...
I know a back road we can take.
You get it!
The money's right here!
It was your idea remember?
I'm doing this for you.
Are you sure?...
It'd be quick.
In the floor.
you could get me money.
I'll get you out of here.
It's far it's another world.
You're sick too...
I wanted to go all the way.
The first time he finished with me he said I was a woman now.
wanted me to hold him.
She was like me.
in the mine.
but the thing was...
You'd never understand.
I mean I would...
But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
You could leave him.
Is that why you're with him?
There's no hope there...
How do you know he's still not here?
You read my mind remember?
How do they look?
What happens when you lose?
I might be able to pick up some action there.
Day like today you'd be dead in no time.
I like that about me beautiful.
Shit I'm sorry!...
What'd you say to me!
A hundred and...
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Yeah if you could send it care of...
But which I can get.
And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
And that's not the half of it Mr.
Keep your change.
Bus three-twenty-three.
Twenty more will get you back.
Sure I'll try.
You try to have a nice day now would you?
Go back to your family.
I want you to be my wife....
No baby you got it wrong.
Nice meeting you son.
Well it's about time.
Like you did me.
Yes yes hit me...
You call yourself a police...
I am looking town.
I not even moving.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
I had to put him down.
I read about you in the paper.
I'll keep it in my office room.
No no no no no...
You need to go now.
Once again please?
I think that was the first time.
What about the game?
We're supposed to be honest.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Not often but it is possible.
Anyway I decided not to wait.
I was thinking it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Is this David?
I've come to a decision.
No that's it.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?...
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Or a cold...
What do you think that means?
Not a specific day.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Just not this second.
And I have been sick.
Normal people do.
My wife is right.
Was there anyone else involved?
One last question.
Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
That guy in green.
Then they drink too much.
You could have been one of ten thousand things...
You made that decision...
and I find that very very interesting.
I've come to understand that...
It's for last week's game.
At the church...
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
What is over?
Was it serious?
Your answer to my question.
Seventy-five percent?
That's not nearly good enough for me.
You've never been sick?
He's been through a lot in his life.
They were bad...
But he made it.
He's doing well today.
They want you to come down to his school.
I'm not walking all the way over there.
He's got the most beautiful eyes...
The hell kind of question is that?
Says he knows you.
That was me they were talking about.
That man was right.
There's no more left?
How many did you put on that time?
What do you do if something happens?
Two hundred and seventy.
How much did you take off?
You put too much.
That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
There's nothing to do.
I have to do some things.
I told them you were great.
They say he can run the fifty--
How about your room then?
That's what I said to my son.
You like football?
It's my field.
Against a window.
Where were you sitting on the train?
I've seen way too much of it in my job...
And it always does with that game.
It's not a thing many people would understand.
How did you get together?
Well go get it then.
Do you want it or not?
I got a present for you.
This was the last time.
No more sitting in this room.
I've let it go on long enough.
For what they done?
But what they done they...
That's all they get?
After what they done?
All she done was...
he's just a...
And that other one Bill being true to his wife...
Down the street and across.
Whereas a president...
We never seen him up against any...
like these ones...
Asked what they looked like that's all.
Have you seen that thing?
He give 'em names?
He tell you where them others is?
I've seen a lot of...
You're a beautiful woman an'...
a free one.
I thought I was gone.
How long I been here?
or hear them?
Little Bill I thought you were dead.
Find out where them other two went.
a little maybe.
How do you like her?
building a house.
I have done that...
Like I said I...
an' like me.
But he was called...
ah market place.
About where you an' him  was...
an' where you was from...
an' what your names was...
The questions Little Bill asked him...
what sort of questions was they?
It says ""This here is what happens to...
Good example of what I'd like to know?
He was making him...
he said he was sorry an' all...
thought you know that.
He went South yesterday.
The rest is yours...
You could have it.
You better get on back Miss.
How he's...
On account of...
First one what?
the first one.
I was even...
Is it him?
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yeah he's in there.
You still think he's in there?
After a ways.
You missed him?
What happened did you hit him?
not without we go down there.
Better get him.
He got the boy's horse.
did that really happen?
I mean how they say it happened?
Now hold on boys hold on.
Better there's three of us...
Well we was.
Like you said I changed my mind an'...
Been gone near three years now.
Five hundred a piece.
I could of...
Who was next?
Or was it...?
I was lucky in the order.
What do you write...
letters an' such?
think I'm...
Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
or maybe tomorrow morning.
Then we could head back all three of us with the money.
I seen her...
Easy Bill easy.
Take a drink will you?
He's dead Bill.
I seen him.
you said that last night.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
He hit you?
A man like me...
an' get yourself a woman?
Sure I got to.
ever go into town...
none of the boys.
You was a...
I just need the money...
for a new start...
She knew me back then...
Got used to my bed.
Cut up a woman.
if they done you wrong...
All that money...
What is it son?
I done it before.
Well suppose he does?
We done that stuff.
Depends what he told you.
About Bill you mean?
The two of us could do it.
That was your idea I wanted to...
Plenty of times.
You done this before?
Hell I seen them.
What was the money for?
There was ninety-one million -
You can stop looking.
county with a guy they
You said something earlier about it.
He says he knows his face.
I've seen his face.
I see it when I close my eyes.
They were there to buy something.
They'll never stop.
Time to look into me a little more that's what.
They just said they wanted time.
Just forget about it.
Can you believe that?
New York police - Jesus.
first thing in the morning.
You've come far.
Now remember this is another kind of business.
So what is it you do Mr.
I hope so too Mr.
He said he did jobs for him.
Always five times more money than the job was worth.
This is not right.
So who did it?
How many times have you been in a line- up?
I was trying to make a point.
They fucking know everything.
Everybody I ever worked with did time with.
We all go.
Then who goes?
I'm trying to make a point.
You do some time they never let you go.
What do you care what he says?
What's that all  about?
I can run.
People say I talk too much.
Just do what I tell you.
What if I
Tell her what happened - Everything.
She knows people.
What-are they speaking?
Send her a card - something.
Not if we do it my way.
They'll do anything.
I said no way.
You say it's the real thing?
I need this.
What do you care whether I come or not?
You have to come.
They're coming out for one job - Thursday.
If you'll just let me -
I'm sorry but I have other things -
You were waiting for a line-up then too.
What happened with that?
We've met once or twice.
Last time was in...
Did you ever think to ask me?
I've been
This I had to see myself.
Let's say for example -
He does not change it.
We know you can get to us and now you know we can get to you.
Do join us.
It seems Mr.
You set up the line-up.
We all know what this is.
Now let's cut the shit.
One day's work.
Tell him we'll meet.
He wants to meet you.
He called last night and asked me to set it up.
What do I tell him'
We want to meet him.
He's a middle-man for somebody.
Call if you're interested.
A little of both.
Business or personal?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Something I - forget it.
He'll have to know how close we came.
Which is shit.
They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Not exactly but there's a lot more to his story.
If somebody wants to get you you know They'll get you out there.
unless you turn state's.
I post today.
You think he's..?
Not good like you.
I mean a stand up guy.
I believe he's dead.
He would never -
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead.
Or did you?
He used all of you to get him on that boat.
NO NO NO NO NO.
It was his will.
Why did he want you to live?
He wanted me to live.
But how - wait.
It was a hit.
She knew who he was and what he knew.
I said I never heard of him.
I WAS AFRAID OKAY?
YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME.
GIVE IT TO ME.
I KNOW EVERYTHING.
YES YOU DO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT.
You know what I'm getting at.
It's always simple.
I thought we could make it.
That night we got the call.
They knew me better than I did.
They knew all of us.
Oh but it's not.
If he comes up for anything it will be to get rid of me.
So why play into his hands?
Where do you think the pressure's coming from?
Turn state's evidence.
Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
I told it like it happened on the boat.
So what if I left out how I got there?
So you got what you wanted out of me.
NOT FROM ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
You tell me he's dead so be it.
I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
You got him wrong.
For a woman?
He was using her.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up I'm telling you.
I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
I just want to hear your story.
I know he was good.
I know you're not telling us everything.
He said I'd never work again....
Is  that correct?
I'll meet you here.
Well well when can we meet again.
) I'm sorry...?
If I can only call him..
'  Can you get out tomorrow?
You -- Listen:  you said to me `if not now when...
and they called him  up and said to come out.
Her husband left her and he took her kids....
'  `That's correct.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
It is hard to say.
Perhaps a year.
It depends to a certain extent on him.
No there's nothing you have to say to me.
And I'll probably never come back.
If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
He had no right to say that.
It was my responsibility.
Her mother told me most of then before she died.
She is not my wife.
And when she goes to those places...
and goes into that other world...
is someone else again.
But you knew about this.
You're good at your job.
She looks so lovely and normal...
Which is easier?
How can I see her to know her?
It's not my line.
walking in a different way...
Sat there a long time not moving...
and I had to leave to got to the office.
That evening when I came home I asked what she'd done all day.
More and more in the past few weeks.
How often does this happen?
and she is somewhere else away from me...
Do you think I'm making it up?
Then you're of no use to me.
And have him check you both.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife what would you say?
Not what you think.
Would you like a drink now?
I'd like to have lived here then.
Like all this.
And you like it.
How long have you been back?
My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest.
No she's all right.
She's still here.
But I'll get her home soon.
You love me now!
I was a set-up.
Why did he pick on me?!!
Did he train you?
Just as I've done.
Not just the hair and the clothes!
And she was the one who died.
The real wife.
Who was at the top when you got there?
With his wife?
It's my second chance.
I'll follow.
Take me away...
God knows I tried.
""  But I did.
So am I But it has to be done.
Then when it's done we'll both be free.
I want to stay here.
I have to go back into the past.
Would you rather go somewhere else?
I've got my face on.
That's what I had in mind.
Is that the best you can do?
Well after all it's ""our place.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Then I'll do it.
I just want you to love me.
The trouble is I'm gone now.
I want you to love me.
If I let you change me will that do it?
If I do what you tell me will you love me?
Something in you.
The one that's dead.
And not even that very much.
I want to go away.
Will it fit?
It's a horrible idea!
Is that what I'm here for?
To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
They're none of them right.
And this one --  -- is beautiful.
No it's not right.
I want to!
Nothing but the best.
There's a good one.
Stay in the chair!
And nothing would...
We'd just see a lot of each other as friends and you'd ""take care of me""?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Oh I understand all right.
Oh Well thank very much.
But no thanks.
And what will I live on?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Thank you again.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Matter of fact to be honest I've been picked up before.
and what else?
Then will you for me?
Will you have dinner with me?
I live here!
I want to know who you are.
Listen what is this?
Where did you live before!?!
No a year ago!
Where did you live a year ago!!?
It's a place to live that's all.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
Who you are --
Let me come in.
So you'd better go.
You're not far wrong.
I've heard that one before too.
Just let me talk to you.
I Just want to talk to you!
A pick-up!
No I happened to see you come in and I thought --
No there are just a few things I want to ask you and --
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
You believe that I love you?
Let me go!!
It had to.
It's not fair it's too late.
To the church I must go there.
There are things I have to tell you about how we met and why we are together.
But they can wait.
there's something I must do...
we're together...
I love you too...
And it's a all real.
I've never been there!
Now think hard darling.
You've been there before.
You've seen it!
You've seen it.
so very clear...
for the first time...
all of it...
Can you tell me?
Only this far.
but I wanted to see you...
be with you...
stay with me...
I'm so afraid...
I'm here I've got you...
And so explain it away?
But there is a way to explain it you see.
find the beginning put it together...
Would you know her if you saw her?
Would you know the room?
There is so little I know.
and yet not me...
someone else in other clothes of another time doing things I have never done...
but still me...
But I've never come to the and; I've always come back before then.
Again and again?
And I have to know.
somewhere in the light.
Take me away from here?
Tell me what it is.
Where do you go?
What takes you away?
Somewhere in here I was born...
and here I died and it was only a moment for you...
Would you like a drink of water?
Do you hear anything?
Of all the people who have been born...
and have died...
some two thousand years or more.
If I've been there?
That's silly!
I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
anywhere in particular?
I hope we will too.
-- talking to you...
What a terrible thing to do...
and you were so kind...
I wanted to drive you home.
this is the first time for me too.
No never before.
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?
And live here...
There that's done.
And what do you do John?
Or even John.
I shall call you Mr.
That's a good strong name.
Do your friends call you John?
Yes I knew which one it was.
It's out there now.
You could have looked in my car.
I've been terrible bother to you.
You like it too.
Please drink your coffee.
Where had you been?
Where had you been before?
thank you for the fire.
Of course I remember!
I often go there!
Oh of course I remember that!
Her car is gone.
In her room?
Well yes of course if you ask.
But it does seem silly...
Would you please go and look?
I would have seen her you know.
I saw her come in five minutes.
she only comes to sit.
Two or three times a week.
And I never ask questions you know.
Oh it must be two weeks.
How long has she had the room?
Yes that's it.
Has she done something wrong?
And I do believe it's against the law!
Would you tell me who has the room on the second floor in the corner that corner?
Is there something I can do for you?
As a matter of fact I thought I might give it to you.
What is it a still life?
Well it's a living.
Oh I'm having a wonderful time!
I've gone back to my first love...
What I've been doing?
this and that.
What'll we talk about at dinner?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone.
Where do you go these days?
Is she pretty?
I'm not telling you what I think!
I'm telling you what he thinks!
Who's the guy who's the wife?
I've told you enough.
Come on tell!
And she died...
The poor thing....
All right come on.
Do you know him well?
Not that kind of history.
The small stuff!
About people you never heard of!
Come on you know everybody.
None of this ""hello you look wonderful"" stuff.
Just a good straight ""who do you know"" --"
I look up I look down.
I look up --
Here I'll show you what I mean.
We'll start with this.
I asked my doctor.
Sorry old man.
I got a call from him today.
You'd think I'd would.
I'm still available.
Three whole weeks.
I've never run across one like that.
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.
From that music.
I'm having one now.
Nothing for a while.
what'll you do?
Well you've got it.
And what a moment to find out I had it.
No it's your life.
And what happens after tomorrow?
More than you think.
And this thing goes out the window.
I shall be a free man.
By her own hand.
the name I do not remember.
She came from somewhere small to the south of the city...
young yes; very young.
and there was a child.
This was it.
It was built for her.
Well if it's absolutely necessary...
Can we have it by tonight?
We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
She'll be out in a moment.
Nothing like it.
"" She's a person!
She's fucking hot!
Well that's what I said.
You go home!
About anybody but yourself.
You never have.
They're not on to us.
They're on to us.
What are you fucking talking about?
I have plenty of friends.
That's why you never had any friends.
We were playing...
she hit her head.
I was just playing...
we were playing just playing around.
No first of all.
First of all...
If you want to come get your numbers in order by then.
Let's all go back in.
I got children.
I've got a life.
They figure this shit out.
They always figure it out.
It has worked.
It will not work.
They're on me.
At the seven-eleven.
Oh I did?
This is war.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing.
It's not a good thing.
We did what had to be done.
That is absolutely not true.
So that's what we're doing.
We've already done this.
What are we left with?
I see that line.
I can take care of this.
Have you ever done this before?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Nobody knows she's here.
Have you completely lost your mind?
So you get her out of here.
We can do this.
We can get her out of here.
What were we doing officer?
are we sure she's dead?
Just wait a second.
Wait one second.
What do you think you are doing?
You want to hear me out?
Four hours and fifteen minutes.
Have you thought about what I said?
We go to the police.
Before they find out.
We save ourselves.
You and I have done nothing.
I want you to hear me out.
It has to be done.
That's the real point here.
What's left?
If anything ever happens to me...
I tell mine that they're little men.
I tell them they're strong.
I let 'em know.
So they really know that I need them just as much.
Just as much man.
I'll help the little guy.
I'll put him in the car and take him out there.
She's all your's.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
My father said first of all I'm your father not your friend.
I'm your father.
It's what my father said to me.
He said it and he meant it...
He told me and I heard him...
They've all been real times.
That's one idea.
I know you'll be.
So where's that leave us?
And a house.
Do you have something to tell me?
She's still working?
she's still working.
All day every day.
Give me two more.
He just had two.
I'm not talking to you?
What's your fucking point?
The past is the past.
Here's his head.
and put her in the ground.
Where do you look?
And when they do they do big.
Do you get me?
I want my fucking money!
In no way have you mentioned that money.
I'm the serious one here.
I'm the one making the play.
And I want my money.
I'm talking about some bad bad very bad things.
Those are bad fucking things!
Only deal is...
Here's the deal and it's a good one.
She's the mother of those kids!
Take care of business.
And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
You want to know what you are doing here?!
You are walking the walk.
You love this woman.
Love is second to nothing.
We will do what it takes.
What you just said.
Now that is the question!
That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves.
I said what have we done?
What is the question you asked me?
What did you ask me?
I got a best friend in there in pieces.
He's having a problem here.
However it goes the point is nobody says anything to anyone ever.
This is real time.
Personal power has nothing to do with any of this.
Is there anyone who does not understand that?
All right people.
Somebody must know she's here.
Well we can definitely call the police.
That's an easy call.
If we call the police...
They ask us...
We say ah...
got a little out of control...
they were making love...
call the police.
She's all your's Fish.
Who's up for making some real money?
Yeah I'll hold.
What did you tell her?
The need to know is clear.
You said nobody would miss her.
Oh that's just nothing.
Not really, no.
They got plenty of room down there, number one.
There's my point exactly.
Look what's all around you.
People who wish bad bad things for you and your people.
They have a president.
Then what do they have?
What do I see?
You hate women.
Your ideas never work out.
The hell I did!
Are we supposed to?
It's great...
DO YOU LOVE ME?!
all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy.
I just love you so much...
He could have told someone.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
You stop right here.
it's all...
She was dead.
There was nothing else to do.
What kind of stupid question is that?
It's okay baby.
Talk what out?
Can we just talk this out?
We'll all be right in.
Then you'd better work on it in the car.
I'll see you in about four hours.
Just like an hour or so.
We're on our way home.
we're running a little late.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Not too much.
Well the night is young.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Will you please call the chair people?
Come send me off.
I'll call them from the road.
Go down where?
You go down there.
We've got problems here.
With all my heart.
You will not be common!!!
I am not common.
Is that to much to ask?
Is that to much to ask!?!
I've seen it on television.
You expect more what?
And I expect more from you.
That's responsibility.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...
I have nothing to do with it.
You know how important this is to my mother.
I'm not playing around.
What do you mean you think so?
he says thanks for the ball come on let's play.
My boy is just like me.
You never walked away dad.
You could have walked away.
I could have done it better.
You did all right dad.
You know just to be with you father and son before you run off and do your own husband daddy thing.
Well if you do think about names...
It's done me all right.
If I was to think...
If I were to think...
And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...
I am all that.
I do but...
And what if I already had it?
What if it's gone?
And I never saw it?
That's a fucking beautiful thing.
Just a beautiful thing.
That's my point!
You see Man...
You get me?
It would only last a second but that second was it.
It was it.
That's what dad had us looking for...
Out back we'd light 'em up.
And dad would be all...
""watch for it""...
Have another drink.
He's your brother.
It just gets worse.
I just want her to be happy.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
That's what I'm thinking.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
I want a black one.
A little black brother.
That's a big problem it seems to me.
That's a big one.
I want to join that Big Brother thing.
"" Fifteen months of my dad's life right there.
My father never got over it.
"" I've seen that play.
A lot of times...
and I have to say this...
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
You can tell when people believe you.
Did she believe you?
The first day.
I got to agree with that.
How do you know she's dead.
That ought to be about the end of that.
You know,  Darling you...
you send me...
Oh I know that.
How does it go...
You Send Me.
What will that be?
I kind of like ""till death do us part.
That's our plan.
Think big picture take your time.
You sure got room for them.
I just love love love love it.
You see where I am here?
You see for me it's over.
Fish I'm really sorry.
It's a present from my parents.
Stop this stop this.
And I've got news for you too.
I'll come to you tonight.
Take me there.
Tell me the answer to this!
We'll all fit.
even if what you say is true.
Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
You must listen to me before you go.
Let me pass!
You must be out of your mind.
Thank you my child!
I should like you to do something for me.
If you like I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
His mother wanted to keep him.
She came from a poor family.
And what do you know about life?
Oh some years ago I heard my mother talking about it.
But is it true?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
Was that difficult to get?
I'm well...
It's only that...
It's all very odd sir.
But what can I say to her sir?
She'll only look at me that way again...
Perhaps she'll listen to you.
Speak to her again.
But sir what can I say to her?
Women are good at that sort of thing.
Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.
Speak to her.
Just say the word sir and I'll do anything.
Yes yes but there's no need to bring that up.
Sit down woman sit down.
Leave me now.
You can go to bed.
They made me...
They told us you'd be back tomorrow...
What will the lady say?
Tonight but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
Okay let's get a move on!
That's good land.
That's fifteen by seven?
He was asking for it.
My God what have you done to him!
Come on miss.
What can we do if that's the way it happens?
You see how much you like her?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
You should have enough to do in this house...
Come here and listen to this.
What I do every day but I want to do it earlier.
Let her do what she wants.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
There's plenty of money in this house.
It can still be used.
I'm not like him am I?
He was very good.
Better than some people would think.
Is she coming back?
She's left.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want.
The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Do they worry you that much then?
Those times are over!
I'm not like you you have your wife.
Do what you think's best.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
If I wait until tomorrow it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days.
What's he called?
I'll leave it to you.
How much do you want for him?
And let him get run over by somebody else?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
It's for people!
You heard what the doctor said.
If it had been seen to in time...
This'll take time.
But with the help of God we'll pull through.
Things seem to be getting better.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow.
And you look after him as if he were a sick brother.
Is anything the matter Mr.
Yes -- very very big!
It's a very big one.
In you go!
They shut all right now.
All I know is that I've changed.
But you should have told me.
I had so many things to think about!
You can leave tomorrow morning.
But why does he want to see me?
I'm afraid that his health is not good.
You will certainly never see him again.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I saw him only once some years ago.
All right Mother.
I'll talk the way I want to.
I've had enough of this.
Good then let's go!
When you are miss.
Give the little girl to me.
Right let's go.
That will soon pass.
Yes yes I saw you!
Today a good girl.
How are we today?
I'm sorry I thought you were somebody else.
) I've had one sitting around for years.
Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
There was no way to see it until it was too late.
I wish we could hear them.
Yes or no Mr.
How would you like your old job back?
Fine  you want to stay here?
There might be something in it you can use.
I'm getting by.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
you pull me out?
I need your help--
I think we both know who did.
I should have told him.
And there is nobody who knows him better than you.
That's also where Mr.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
It's already been called off.
This is a full pardon.
Not from in here.
Think you can do it?
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him.
How does he know who I am?
I'M WHAT?!
Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
I hate to say it but it is.
As far as the public is concerned it is.
I never give my best stuff away.
This is supposed to be years away.
It's better than real.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Do I get to see it or not?
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Talk so I can understand.
Turn it down!
I wonder how that...
I told you this would work..
He still thinks he's in the real world.
Help me get out of here.
What do you expect me to do thank him?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
I had something a little different in mind.
It was me what?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
And what I'm not.
You're free to go  right now.
Find out anything?
That or living through him...
Part of him is.
I should have told you.
He's back!
He's come back!!!
Start of what?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
I'm doing the best I can!
You know I am.
What did you do to those people?
I know what you meant.
All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well but then I...
You better like coffee.
You're awful at it.
I told you it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
She's beautiful you know?
How did you get your hand out?
As a matter of fact it is.
I am War I am death.
I'm still working on it.
I know who would know.
You say that like you're close personal friends.
Never felt better in my life.
Every time I said it it was.
And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
You have to make me understand.
A little less than yesterday.
Now is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Let me put it to you this way...
whether I'm here...
or whether I'm not...
YOU HEAR ME?
Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
You and me have nothing in common.
You know we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
Where's John?

Give it a chance.
I met them before you were born.

That's great Dad.
And I was right.
Your brother never...
Not in here Dad...
Dad it takes time.

They're all on.
Stay here I'll see what I can do.
You better go buy him a present.
First of all Mr.
And what makes you think it's his birthday?
I brought a birthday present for Mr.
Then call him back.
And call me back.
What if they call him?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
It's ready to take off.
Up a quarter...
or maybe we can just drive around for a while.
You're just the President of the company what do you know?
He never told me...
let's do it.
Too much to do...
but I'll walk you out.
Who's listening?
""What are you thinking?
that was it.
I hear you're moving up in the world.
It's the free market.
You're one of us now...
How much is enough?
I gave 'em my word.
I took another look and I changed my mind.
You used me.
What's worth doing is worth doing for money.
Now wait a minute Dad...
I want him to look at it.
tell me more...
What makes you think you can?
Close to two million.
The lights coming up over the water.
I had to sell.
The break up value is higher.
I just wish I could've got more.
You work hard.
And where'd it get you?...
You had what it takes to let through my door.
Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
What about hard work?
It's not what I do.
Something big's about to go down.
see that building?
I bought into it ten years ago.
Now it's a day's pay...
I remember that deal.
You were involved?
Know the name?
How do you know about my father?
not bad for a City College boy.
Nice club Mr.
put the rest of it in a money market account for now.
Buy any for yourself?
Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
So how's business today.
Nice to see you again Mr.
My home number's on the back...
The last to know?
Yeah and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
I just want to let you know Mr.
Oh no no...
Why am I listening to you?
Like these how'd you get these?
I think we could've made a good team...
but that's how it goes...
You really mean that?
To take you public?
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
I've been doing that all my life.
And you're doing fine.
Why are you doing this!
You've worked hard to get where you are.
I told my father and those people...
I was afraid something like this could happen.
Your dad took care of you.
but my father lost all his money...
You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
but you me the world.
make love to me...
Do you think you're ready?
Is that alright?
let's not even eat.
Let's just watch it and think about it.
You're not trouble by any chance.
Well why stop at that?
the best of everything...
I like that in a man.
The conference oh yeah.
If I could have anything...
this would almost do.
I once bet a horse.
He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
Only if I want something bad enough.
See you Friday.
I'm moving to the East Side soon.
but that's just conversation...
what about real things?
The two of us.
It absolutely makes the room.
I'd give anything to have this in my house even for a week.
As in: never have so few done so little for so much.
So what do you see in this?
Oh yes I remember you.
Where you been the last two days?
Maybe it does.
I want you to go back to him.
Help keep his head straight.
Now tell me why would I want to do that?
Do you understand?...
You told him about us?
You look like Black Thursday.
They were over a long time ago.
You got a card?
Well Christmas is over and business is business.
No not interested.
And we're on our way!
This time I'm in for the long term.
If you mean what you say I think we're in the ball park.
I'll take it to my people.
I mean we're talking major body
Yes I'm sure.
You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
I missed you so much.
I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.
Us is over.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Anybody want another drink?
Too late for that sir.
Can I get you some help?
We're all here and ready sir!
Have a nice day  sir
Well it all started when a friend and I
this is Mr.
Who's is all this?
I met this man.
We've got to get back.
No no James it's not like that.
I'm looking for something else.
MARK Why not?
Then why do you still like her?
Must be what we came for.
Anyone else not coming?
Safety in numbers man.
Can this be stopped?
I think  that our Mr.
most of these books will tell you how!
Six six and six
Well it's a long story.
I love them
No thank you sir we're fine.
Now run along darling.
When - you're a big boy.
I mean you know it's bad for you
Now drink your milk you're late for college
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell why not.
Then we both are.
But once I heard...
I started seeing things.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
is the choice.
I made to be your mother.
Can we please not do that?
I wanted to tell you.
But it never felt right.
I'll come back all the time.
It's only two hours away.
Okay look I see what you're doing here and that's I'm sorry but that's not it.
Let's deal with that.
see me or you know that I'm...
that's something's wrong...
Nothing serious this...
But the car looked bad.
It could have been bad.
She said ""You know.
""  That I know.
I just know that when all this was happening I felt some part of me felt...
Like somebody needed me.
Your friend saw them.
And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
You think that'll help?
I'd rather not say...
Do you have any idea who she is?
I saw her in the water.
How do you know it's a she?
sometimes I forget things...
Why is this so hard?
Then why did you?
Who's idea was it?
At the party.
There was just...
I remember being concerned.
I'm just not sure what you mean.
What can be?
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
It's good to see you two doing so well.
It's a lovely party.
Give me that shit.
when will she be back?
Well maybe your wife...
From next door.
I'm running late here.
Perhaps we could be friends.
I tried to leave him.
What were you so afraid of?
Your house is so beautiful.
When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Please forget that I...
it's so...
And I'm sorry.
I've never even met you.
How can you help me?
That I'll just...
that one day I'll just...
Oh god I'm so afraid of...
it's too much...
From the window.
It's Mrs...
She wanted to be a doctor.
What was her major?
She wanted to stay close.
He left when she was twelve.
She never mentioned her father.
Sounds about right.
we met at a party.
She never mentioned you.
She got it.
Turned it down.
She's making this up.
My best stuff.
You should have heard her play.
I came in from my room...
just so she could cut them off.
We know each other.
You hear something...
change the subject.
You find something...
If you want to put this back together...
just let it go.
You've got a beautiful life.
You should too.
What if he was?
Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Did he say that?
But I mean I'm just making this up...
There's got to be a way that you can close it.
That could take days.
I need to do something now.
She wants us dead.
Now that I do...
I'm a terrible friend.
I got there first.
I had just been left by Richard.
I started to walk over...
She was young.
I should have said something right away.
You have to listen to me.
This is not something that I can do right now.
Whatever it was it's gone.
I need it to be gone now.
And he's the real thing.
Something was there.
You saw it.
I met her.
I think so
Nothing's happening.
Sit down here.
In the window.
Someone's there.
Know what I think?
But what else could it all be?
I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out say Thursday morning?
Lose a husband get a car.
You bought it.
So you'll have some later.
Thanks but I'm fine.
I brought you this.
IT'S TRUE.
you have to believe me!
There was nothing I could do for her.
She's doing this!
This is exactly what she wants you to think!
I did NOT!
On my life!
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Little village down seven.
We should take a drive before they're gone.
She was there and then she was gone.
I felt it.
She did it.
How did she know where it was?
I tried to break it off!
would do anything just to be around me.
Leave her out of this!
THAT'S NOT TRUE!
so you gave it all to her.
What did you think I would do?
I gave up my life and my music...
Just get away from me.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...
in my house.
I'm positive this time...
I thought it was Mrs.
This is the woman who I've seen.
I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
We were moving.
It was a hard time.
I took you home.
In the living room...
You told me that I was...
We walked all night...
I felt you...
looking through me...
You were lost in the music...
You sat in front...
I saw you there...
Call ya later.
Do I have everything?
Really big bed.
I'll see you for dinner.
I will NOT.
I believe in what's happening.
This is something that's happening to me.
It's not to get even...
But then you've been so much better...
But I know what I saw and what I heard...
Let them know we're running late.
Okay okay I'm sure that I just...
like it never even happened...
And why is she here?
I'll bet there's...
She could be out.
She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Where is she then?
It's her!
From the sun.
It's not from here believe me I...
All right look at this.
She's in the picture.
I went over to look and she's gone.
The table was set for one.
He'll see.
That's just mean.
for my father.
And he says...
You'll never believe...
You know what that does to me.
You are so brilliant.
I'm sure I'm just...
I've got the conference next week.
Can you drive me home?
I'll bring you back in the morning.
Unless you need me to come home...
I just wish you could have heard her.
It's what I've been working for.
The conference is in less than two weeks.
But what if something happens?
To make sure she's all right.
We were never like this.
I want to go over there.
After dinner we can--
Remember how we were?
Of him I think.
I'm finished at three.
Maybe we should just...
It's just us now.
You did a great job.
To get my life back.
To have some time for myself.
Some time for us.
I am really.
It's okay if you're not.
I'm just about...
If you have to work...
It's today?
When's she out of here?
What's their name?
I think three...
Christ that's twice in...
When did they move in?
:Oh I wish.
:What do you mean ""They"" are?
:Well they are.
:Would you stop it!
But why would they do that...?
With his hands!
There are two.
He's not to know.
But you've not told Michael.
I have seen him again.
You could work again!
You could make it ours.
Then what is he...?
Many times over the past thirty years.
What are you talk---
Every day  twice.
I'll probably be back in a week...
you'll check on her - every day...?
well - I'm already out of her life.
Yes - and you have.
Do you see...?
and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
""Go back Michael.
Do what you can...
she is not to hear about this.
There is a lot to read
Lots of times...
But no one else did.
A few hours.
With her family.
It's over a month.
The police say it happens all the time.
They'll find him somewhere.
Then you wear it.
He made that quite clear yes.
I want to see my mother.
I'm not saying I believe it...
A lost little girl in a world too full at things
I'm NOT like you!
I'm NOT!
Did you like it...?
But I had to use my hands.
Your mind is sick!
that is what we are.
Why are you doing this...?
Better than most I suppose.
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
All yours now.
There are things I have to know!
you cut me off from every -
You NEVER let me know her.
Who gave you that right...?!
I'm coming down there!!
I've been up all night - and I would.
What's the matter with you...?!
What kind of person are you...?!
I had you sent away.
ALL THIS TIME...?
All the same
But my mother...
The door Michael.
Go back MICHAEL...
He just went out like & light-
- and he seemed okay.
My time has come.
Your time is gone.
All one in the same...
They want to come back.
And on  it has gone - father to mother...
sister to brother...
see what I am my love.
With all your power - see me and know what I am.
There was no thought.
There was no act.
That is not what I am.
I do not understand...
What is wrong...?
I love Michael...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning...
But have I...?
She called to me!
No my love.
I want nothing more of the dead.
I only wanted to see as others do...
feel as others do...
I LOVE MICHAEL.
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE him!
But I could understand.
I want to understand!
What you can learn.
What I can give you.
So much more than Michael can.
It's too soon to know.
And you will have a child...
If that were true I would not be here.
There is no one here but the dead.
Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.
Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.
what do you think of yourself now my love...?
And you will feel that.
Do you understand...?
If I could feel like you feel...
Things to be felt yes --- but not nine to feel...
To love you must be able to feel.
It is from love.
I am with you my love.
Like no other can ever be.
There are things you will not tell him.
you are my son -
I am your son.
I could not - ever.
'  You are my mother.
You are here for me now.
Michael is gone!
Let me go...
How is your heart Father...?
Put - him - down!
His - his heart...
He's gone Michael...
Where --- where is ---
Michael - I'm sorry...
Just give me -
Michael - please -  just.
But I'm on the outside now...
you put me there!
Nothing is wrong with me.
I know something's in there - and so do you.
Something's wrong with you.
What were you talking about...?
Finish up my section will ya...?
- we made a fire.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Talking to me dear...?
I've spent time there myself.
Michael - look at me.
Did you see the old man on the ---
You look a little green.
That's GREAT!
Either do I.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
It's us - our love.
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Michael - think what I could do with the money!
What about your work back home...?
I want to stay here - with you.
Do you love me Michael...?
And so are you.
Think of what's in that book.
Think of last night!
Stop looking at me like that!
Everything that was taken from me is here Michael.
All these years she was there without me.
I should have been here.
God Michael --- what am I...?
Michael - I saw him!
She - she said I - I was a ---
It's not possible --- but I know.
I'll call you there.
What about you coming down here...?
What's wrong..?
Jesus  I've been trying -
for each other.
We're quite a pair you and I.
I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Michael do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
He said he'd see you.
You - you're brilliant...
Seems more like a year than a month.
You stop it.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Christ Michael - what the hell are we doing...?
All I meant was -
Far from it Michael...
so she brought me here...
the day after I was born.
Your family there...?
The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Who was the man on the kitchen floor.
What else did you see- Michael...?
you're very --- different.
The one time I want it to work...
What do you see...?
Then call it in.
I'm in the life business - remember..?
call it-  people come right to the house.
They like you ------- kids.
I'm getting --- left behind.
If you like that type.
He says I can learn to control them.
How are the hands...?
Let me in!
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them.
Is that what you were doing...?
He can stay.
He's got great hands.
You really love this guy...?
but yes we can look into that.
They must be...
Sounds good - thank you
Come to that what the hell have you got that for?
I thought you were someone else
I heard something like that
The one on the left - definitely...
Yes - I have had it for years.
No - not all the time - I mean
All the time?
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
When could I look round?
No - I'll have you after
It's what you would do to me
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
what have I done wrong?
Why did you let him in?
First finish your tea...
Yes - I suppose so...
We've got nothing to talk about
Out - I may be some time
But for how long - what will set you off again?
You want me to wear white for you?
All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...
Nothing could be better...
Telling you all of this writing the book...
Yet I know it was.
Then make it stop...
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
And we did...
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Please - it would help me
Tell me how it happened...
My husband was sick -
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to.
One day I came
Tell me about your wife...
I have something I have to show you...
How long have you been watching me?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
my car  I stopped working from my car.
She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too.
- I said You know what I want.
Yes one and a half please.
I think I will pass...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Yes two please.
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I want you out now
You heard me - keep away from him
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I think you had better leave
So where were you?
And that means you...
So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
It's been what three years?
Yes - of course.
Yes that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
That's good
Yes come on in...
I thought it was you - how are you?
Her husband left her
Just put it in my room
Yes sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Yes - one please.
It'll only take a moment.
I'll be sure to...
Can I have a word?
You got everything you ever wanted.
Get them together.
No leave one.
Hell yes all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
You'll never believe who's in there.
Give me those!
Imagine how you'd feel.
All of this is YOURS.
And this place.
I get it now.
I better go Dad.
So far away?
Maybe not yet.
Cut it out before you break something!
This is the life baby.
Well Dad said...
Who the hell was your father?
Were you always this sick?
God I love being dead.
But hey if you think there's a market for it.
These are real live women?
God you are so hot.
Maybe on the outside.
You expect me to think at a time like this?
Now I'm taking off my clothes...
all by myself.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs.
I mean yeah I do.
So that's a maybe?
So you'll think about it?
We're JUST FRIENDS.
Of course I will...
Let someone else run it.
We miss our family.
We miss our son.
But we can get past all that.
Something real and honest.
It's much too expensive.
You need me?
We have to make them come true.
Just say it Dad.
They did do one great thing.
They gave us our boy.
There was no place for a baby.
Why should I care...
I'm getting so good at this.
It's my private business!
Hang in there I'll think of something.
Of course we were.
maybe we could go away together?
I always knew there was more.
Who exactly ARE you?
I should tell my friend.
It's your car.
These are all your cars.
It's a very expensive car.
You just have to get on and try again.
You do know how to drive?
So here we are.
But we never want you to want for anything.
That is we want you to have everything.
Can you believe that was me?
But we did want you.
Or not being.
Maybe we know now.
It meant the world to them.
You mean they knew who I was?
They knew they did the right thing.
Next month we'll be back to normal.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill.
No problem, consider it done.
You think that would be a problem?
Funny you should say that.
I miss them too.
Are they okay?
You want it in writing?
You can have it then.
They seem to think you're coming home.
This is bigger than our whole house.
It's really late...
do your parents know where you are?
James what are you doing here?
Five years from now.
I need to go to college learn a few things you know.
I was afraid you left.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
It's like being a doctor.
But absolutely true.
I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls.
But none of them make me feel like you do.
I saw that one coming.
You live and learn.
Not many people know that.
He's on the move?
That's probably my office.
He shut down your paper!
That's two words.
If we were a team we could do anything.
I mean anything.
But you never do.
Eventually you'll let go.
It takes a real man to be a dad.
I mean my father.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him?
""  It's two different things.
He had it built.
A girl has to fit in.
What do you think of her?
Write what you want.
You never know around here.
Could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew?
Then I'll write about YOU.
I'm trying to be fair.
I'm still better than you.
I'm trying to help.
In what sense?
Get it over with.
That's just one example.
We missed you so much.
Now's your chance.
You're free.
You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Only the best for my mother.
Oh, good lord.
What is all this?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.
Are they taking good care of you?
Then you break the law.
I answer to a higher power.
But he has no right to stop others.
What kind of sick question is that?
I'll be watching you young man.
Your money and power mean nothing here.
That's a good start yes.
A very good start.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks?
I know you can take it.
A son he never knew.
And I think we all know what that is--
I should work, too.
I wish he never gave you up.
Without your help I'd be lost.
I'm doing all right?
The world is a big beautiful place.
What kind of ideas?
I never finished school myself.
You ARE home.
You can take that to the bank.
I was like a different person tonight.
I told you you could do it.
Why look who's here.
that's the thing...
I've never even actually...
All those people out there.
It's a lot of pressure.
They said that?
Oh your parents.
You ready for your big coming out party?
I think she's doing fine on her own.
As it were.
I mean a whole lot?
Of course I like girls.
You own it now.
I'm seventeen.
I know it like the back of my hand.
You've got the wrong guy.
I'm terrible at this.
It's about your parents.
I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
People pay good money for that?
They built the school...
Apparently I'm the last to know...
Hey I've got it I may as well spend it right?
You look pretty.
Hey come on.
Eat a power bar.
Could be a lot of other people's too...
How soon can we get something?
And the child...
That came with her.
Not after that night.
All I know is the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy...
She still work there?
He used to come around here.
I know one thing he said.
It was when...
when he took himself out and was standing up.
He said ""No little girl can ever make me come.
And that now he'd be able to help me...
It's hard to remember exactly.
He kept saying ""Let it happen let it happen.
""  Then he just stopped.
I remember my hands were cold.
He was large?
like he was built...
But I have to ask you something here.
I said stop.
They were in me.
The next thing...
you know from behind.
I just want to get it over with.
I just want to forget it.
Would you like to take a break for a minute?
You could tell me where you were last night.
Maybe she used another name.
Maybe I should have called.
Did you call her house to see if she got home?
You'll give this up?
What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Just check out the car.
If you want company...
She could be anywhere...
I did that once.
We all have...
She bought the same story we did...
Where'd you come up with this stuff anyway?
And I'll tell you something else.
It was after the war.
So what about the girls?
Surely her father...
The job looks okay to us.
But look at it from his point of view.
But for him...
I thought of that.
You saw the news today?
She wants to talk.
You know what you get?
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Same with the kids.
They saw her running down the street but that's it.
Her word against his.
Same as him.
They saw her come.
They saw her go.
They saw him follow.
You know that as well as I do.
He did say something.
He stopped by himself.
Did he come in with you?
About a year ago.
No one will see it but us.
Now when was this that Mr.
Yeah maybe a little.
You heard that girl's statement.
Get me a case.
Maybe a year ago...
Where's this coming from?
This girl's had some problems.
I thought I would just go with her stand at the door...
I think I looked away.
There was this coffee table between us and the wall.
I told her I was coming with her.
Just tell us what happened.
I lost control of the situation the one thing they train you for...
God what did I do?
And you saw the girls...
And what do they say?
We've got three.
Not that stuff about her running away him trying to find her.
He was my friend at first.
I said he did.
Now can I go home?
Shit what difference does it make...
And then what...
Hey you're working for it.
You know I want to thank you for getting me into this class...
But I mean...
just the idea that Mr.
I say something funny?
Lots of the kids hang out here.
With we it's different...
Police -- God -- get a life.
Is there some reason why you're here?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Well I do too sometimes...
I miss Dad.
Okay what's the matter?
I'm running away.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Now give me the line.
That's not your line.
But what if they find out...
I want to see you...
I think it was something else...
She's not that way.
I think he did something...
I'm really serious.
There was no way.
I'm sorry it had to happen like this.
I want you to hear this too.
Do it tonight.
We'll figure something out...
You know what it takes.
I mean do whatever you have to whatever it takes...
We have to stick with the plan.
Do it to ourselves?
Jesus Christ what are you doing?
I know what you've been through...
We're running kind of late.
I'll have to look for it.
So where you off to now?
We can set up.
But you might want to wait a minute.
You know I just looked out front.
You suppose you could give me one?
Okay try me on Sunday.
I lost the house.
Let's go make a statement.
I just want my life back...
They're walking a fine line here.
There's nothing for them to get.
Now tell me I'm right.
I know you think you are but you're not.
Let me tell you why.
Not in here.
I'm in some trouble.
But check this...
Stay out of my way.
Now will you tell me what this is about?
Get him in the water.
should never have left it up to him...
That was his name.
I have other friends...
You have friends?
I have friends now...
Is this supposed to mean something to me?
Somebody's got to go.
Well you're half right.
Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Yeah they're bad for your health.
Come off it man...
You mean this thing?
This thing worked out just like you said only better.
What the hell happened anyway?
I told her we would talk on Monday in the office.
I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she wanted to talk.
I hear a car.
I look out the window.
The one you bought at school.
What do you think Mr.
What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
He'll like it.
Go make yourself a new friend.
Yeah real funny.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.
Funny you never met.
But then you knew what he was like all along...
You knew that.
We'll go through it all again tonight.
Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Have you talked to her?
You ought to try it some time.
We'll take the boat out...
A whole new train?
In the next two minutes?
All right all right...
Do you mind?!
The machine was stopped!
Oh I see an easy plan!
Well hell maybe we do have a chance.
It was in your book.
There's only seventy-eight.
We've got to stop him right here now!
When we find him he is mine.
Nothing's ever good enough for you is it?
I spent three years on the stage you know.
We're there before we left!
Got to be somewhere that's hot.
It's a town!
It's not a guy...
Sounds like a train.
Looks like a train.
No record of him.
It's better than nothing.
Tell us something!
Can you fill me in here?
You might have mentioned you had that.
And ever since my policy is: Act first and worry later.
how long ago was this?
Never got it back.
Nothing much to it really.
I saw them coming.
And it cost me...
What way is that?
They got away.
Jim are you all right?
We just follow it.
Hey I tried the board.
they just might do it.
Then the President was right.
What was all that back there?
Now what was that?
it's the only one I have.
That might be useful.
All right if it'll make you happy I'll try that.
Good Lord man.
You need that real often?
Now I know where I've heard of you.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Funny I was just thinking you should do the same.
Listen friend you're obviously lost.
I'll see it through!
He's not giving up?
Well let's help them with that.
I could get used to this looking down on people.
A new friend?
Fine I'll stop.
You bring the best out in a man.
I've had some practice.
Oh I would hope not.
Just a little insurance...
But life can be hard for a man too.
Have you taken a wrong turn Mr.
You most certainly do.
Yes in a way.
I'm the Doctor's social secretary.
I would Mr.
Are you game?
Would you be thinking...
That having been said sir you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!
That would be correct.
Your private train sir.
Why surely Mr.
Well yes sir.
well of course you can.
And now the job's yours.
That'll be all boys.
President good to see you again sir.
Sorry about all that.
Call it what you like.
My own country!
That would be...
Now get up.
We're walking out of here.
You're not that big.
About who you are and all that?
Very good sir!
This is something.
I'm of no use to him now.
That's who it was!
I only met him once but that was enough.
Said I could have the run of the place.
So few men do.
We'll explain on the way.
What do they want with me?
In an hour they're gone!
Figure an hour?
When are they coming?
Thank you friend.
Then come with us.
They're not after me.
They want the baby.
What did you do this time?
I'll win your war for you.
Find a woman to take care of it.
But I can give you these...
Have you really looked at me?
I'm short!
I'm nobody.
The way has been lost in time.
You're strong enough.
I have no family.
Now put her back.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
You're not a woman.
I mean yes.
Are you the mother of that child?
Who is that girl anyway?
But I need help!
Then you get us out of here.
this may be a bad time to ask this question but...
I'm used to her.
I think you're in love.
She's in love.
Well what did she say?
She said lots of thing.
You were in her ten all night.
Did she say anything?
Did she ask about me?
I'll help you...!
She had a hold on my heart.
I thought you had her!
Where's the baby??
Time to leave.
Give me that baby!
She's in good hands.
I could take care of that baby.
I'll look after her like she was me own.
You hear trouble.
I hear something!
As if you care.
I have to give this baby to some- body.
I wish I could take you with me.
Now change me.
I just wanted to test it first.
Now use it.
You will find a way.
I'm all finished.
But what's this got to do with it?
How much more do I have to do of this?
What do I need for that?
That's all I ever wanted!
What do you want!
Who are you!
Right between the eyes.
Somebody has to do it.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
She needs to be changed again.
I changed her already!
She needs to be changed.
We'd better go.
How do these work I wonder?
Hey careful there!
I'm getting her out of there!
Not used to hard work.
Eat up Book.
Not one this big.
Good you start tomorrow.
Sure I'm sorry.
Mine's dead...
And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Where'd you think?
How could you do this to me tonight?
I told you I had company
Everything is all right John.
Try the house.
Book is it?
Are you really ever coming back?
You just do as I say.
And stay there!
Is it them?
I want to say a thing.
The man on the floor?
Who'd you see?
It's all over Paul.
I've already got something worked out.
Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
That's what I called to tell you.
People from outside the department.
But they do now.
But he's part of it.
That's all I can give you.
You know the sort of thing.
It's getting political.
You know who?
So one of them got to him.
Oh he's good.
I want you to take this...
to remember by.
That's God's way!
That's your way not mine.
That's what I know and that's what I do!
There is always a way!
But you are such a...
You'd rather go back to that city!
I'm not so sure of anything as you are John Book.
You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.
Just as I could live yours!
You're so sure of that?
Even thinking about living this life.
Won him over just like that.
A few days.
You may not be well enough.
What else can you do?
Best in the district.
He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
I know what he said.
I'd want a public phone.
It's good that someone can have the use of them.
Your husband's?
You can wear these.
What you stand for.
You tell him.
When you're able.
Listen thank you.
But I've got to go.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Can I have something to drink?
They decided to come and see you for themselves.
He came the first day.
they'll find me.
No no doctor...
Where are you taking us now?
And you're the only one who can do anything.
I would not be too sure.
I heard the other police talking last night.
And I also want to leave this city.
Now what's the problem?
He wants to know who you are.
I meet a lot of people like that.
You have no right to keep us here.
We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
There'll be another train.
It's my job to find out who did it.
I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
I'm a police officer.
Where are you at anyway?
So stay put...
I'm coming in to take care of business.
How hot am I?
Take care of that woman's name for me.
Maybe at the top of it.
I'll call you when I can.
What's happening.
I got there late John.
Can you tell me what he looked like?
Anybody know about this?
What I know Paul is...
Tell me what you know...
He's got my number.
You know where he is.
You've got his car you were the last to see him 
Did you find him?
Children like to help...
Yeah that sounds like John.
you were kind to take us in last night.
Anyway I needed something to do.
Yes thank you very much.
I have to help him!
And so will I...
I am not a child.
They can do it...
then I can not sit at table with you.
I can not take a thing from your hand.
I can not go with you to meeting!
Talk about you not him.
About having you...
And you call this nothing?
How can you do such a thing?
But if he does then we'll find a way so no one knows!
That has no place in this house.
His name is John Book.
John lost control of himself.
He's from...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
All right where is he?
He's not in this building.
But I'm working on him.
She say where he is?
My son is out there!
Get back in there.
I'll watch these two.
You have no right here!
Lady I'm here to help you.
And I tried to get back for days and days.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Oh -- all right.
Fifty-seven fifty-eight --
Oh I hope we got them in time.
From now on you'll be history
We've done what you told us.
have you come back?
Oh come on - come on!
Please come back!
that's exactly so.
No I'm afraid it's true.
Now what happened?
Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country?
Now look here's something that really has a heart.
Can I still have my dog?
That's a good little girl.
I knew you'd see reason.
Oh please give me back my dog!
All in good time my little pretty -- all in good time.
Give him back to me!
There's no place like home.
And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home.
Yes I'm ready now.
Are you ready now?
Oh dear -- that's too wonderful to be true!
I love you all too.
Oh will you help me?
Well then you'll have to walk.
No -- that's true.
And she's worse than the other one was.
I thought you said she was dead.
It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her.
It's all right now - you may all come out.
And there's the house and here you are and that's all...
Oh no no I have to get to her right....
But -- what's this?
Oh -- Oh I've got to go home right away!
Oh no -- no!
Eh -- she's -- What's this?
What's she doing now?
Do you know any?
Oh no I wanted to go along with you.
Now why are you running away?
No I'm wrong.
You're -- running away.
I've got an order!
Let me have...
Oh no no!
You go away you....!
Now you're seeing reason.
You've had plenty of time already!
Oh but I want to go home now.
I knew you would!
Why only --  Oh --
Still I wish I could remember.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh there's one on me!
They're - they're gone now.
Oh but he will!
We've come such a long way already.
Oh dear -- That was wonderful!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh are you all right?
And I've been that way ever since.
How did you ever get like this?
I think I'll miss you most of all.
We all love you.
Oh now I'll never get home!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
They're coming back!
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!
Oh -- Oh come on.
Oh well then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh but -- but please.
Who's her?
Oh-oh quick!
Yes -- let's run!
Just like I knew it would be.
No but you tried to.
What -- what did you do that for?
No -- No -- No -- No!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Oh come on now - everybody --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Oh -- and I was so happy!
I thought I was on my way home!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Dear whatever shall we do?
Why have you been --
Oh -- here quick -- oh!
It does help.
Oh no -- please.
I have to rest for just a minute.
To get him a heart.
Oh you're the best friends anybody ever had!
And it's funny but I feel as if I've known you all the time.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
The other side....
Oh -- oh here it is!
Why it's a man!
Oh I'll try!
Really I will.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
But maybe you'd better not.
Yes -- that's true.
That's where I live.
My it's good to be....
Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Oh well here -- let me help you.
No you see I'm -- Well -- I'm --
You have no power here.
What have you done with them?
Give them back to me or I'll ---
So it was you was it?
Where -- where do we go now?
Oh - I was only trying to help.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
He's got a plan
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Put me together!
Here --   Come on.
Oh you did it yourself!
I better wait for you outside.
We may never see her again.
This is the left one.
Hold still - hold still --
Take it away - take it away - Take it away!
No her dog!
I want to see you and your wife right away....
of the West.
Oh - upstairs quickly!
Oh I hate to think of her in there.
We've got to get her out.
But how can we find her?
We'll get you together!
Oh dear dear.
Who do you suppose they were?
And where did they take her?
A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Well that's you all over.
Oh - look out.
Oh did - did you see that?
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Nobody will hear you!
Oh -- now look at him!
Look -- you can see it here.
Come on -- come on --
How can I ever thank you enough?
I'll - I'll do anything you say only...
Stop that dog!
But I still want one.
And she thinks she got away with it.
What the hell were you doing?
Perhaps after this...
open to that.
resources at first.
If you have a point get to it.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Your last chance.
Give me the name.
Take the money.
I am just a middle man.
Who did you get it from?
So is she.
You will never get near her.
You on the other hand you have something to live for no?
You should have seen her before.
He was my father.
You knew him well?
Just like you...
only you were even easier.
I could have given you the world.
Are you saying...
We had a run-in he and I.
It gave me control.
You knew when you first saw me.
You knew it would be like this.
Not at that price.
You had your chance James.
Looking for a woman a little more your type?
I have to go to work.
you should rest.
You are wrong Mr.
In fact I am the only person who can do it.
Are you trying to break my heart?
Or is it just your way with women?
How long has he been with you?
talk to my father.
Mother of God.
Just you me and my people.
This is a family matter!
Now get me out!
This is too big for even you.
A special job.
where were we?
She was paying you off.
I thought you were the one in her business.
How high up does this...
This is not possible.
I run my little business I stay out of trouble...
You of course.
Someone will come.
You and my father.
could you come?
It is the beginning.
The world will never be the same.
He was a...
Why are you like this?
Any word from him?
Cost three million plus.
This so-called.
What about our end?
They want in.
He would -- You might as well know.
No idea who's behind this?
That man then he was the first.
The first you --
In your mind.
He was a bad dog.
Shit once a day.
There's no right or wrong.
I want to know all about you.
What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Space and time.
I see it all now.
What -- am I --
That's not the way it happens.
You have the power to do it.
I want you to do it.
do something about it!
Ever since the day I died.
-- And you've always known.
Not you not the others.
Just be being with me.
I left the earth when I lost you.
Did you love me once?
Does it -- keep time?
I've already seen it.
I could stay and go.
Would you like me to stay?
Not yet there's plenty of time.
Is it time?
I heard this morning.
We'd better hope so.
-- It's almost time.
as if the world was any better for it.
I've seen them!
I've seen them in there.
Stand back from the field.
It's not on tape.
It's live.
We're watching it happen.
How'd you get it on tape?
Twenty-four years ago.
See I've been working on a little project.
I just wanted you to --
Not at this late date.
He thinks someone's.
We'll tell them what's happened.
Everything's changed --
What year is this??
He changed the past.
Trying to change the past.
He said it was the only way to save the world --
You're full of yourself.
The world's about to end.
I feel like I could save it.
Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Just want to keep 'em interested.
What the hell --?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Would you want to sit out a war?
I mean -- what would be left.
Where exactly are we?
If you're with me --
-- What is it.
One more down.
I could use some dinner.
I'd never seen his face.
Pick a record.
Here you pick one.
I like the way you look.
I'm thirty-eight years old!
You use that stuff?
I'm not his.
I'll be right down the hall if you want me.
What you were saying before it's absolutely right.
-- I'd love to have you stay.
You'll find something.
-- I should go.
You and me seeing each other someone might put two and two together.
No place to live.
Whatever happened to him?
What was his name.
You made your choice.
It was work for the government or do time.
He's been the one all along.
Okay let's just.
You've always been a good friend.
We've got no place to go.
What new information?
Did anybody follow you?
See you come here?
I'll put it back together for you.
Better than ever.
Do you have the --
We should get back --  What?
Now get out of my way!
But it's a wonderful product.
I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?
In fact I think I'll have one now.
You mean he's --
Let's move it.
Am I free to go?
Six to eight months.
What does it --
They have something else in common as well.
Their real names please.
Maybe I'll do that.
-- Try one of mine.
Darling you need to get out of the house.
He's changed the world.
You got it all wrong.
Two things I hate.
I got nothing to do with --
-- How'd you find me?
You're making a big --
Before you do that you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Now if you boys care to join me we'll go save the world.
You're making us all look bad.
Bigger than I thought.
Too important for telephone.
Ever see one of these before?
All for show.
I'm pretty happy to see me too.
So are you done with me yet?
So now that you know you understand why it's important that we get it back.
They're on to me now remember?
You're sure about that?
What the hell am I after?
Just remember I'll be watching.
Is all that clear?
I've got some news for you Mr.
What do I get out of it?
Your kind of people.
I plan on getting a lot older.
I've already got a job.
Good thing you were there to save the day.
Come walk with me.
You're a cold piece of work.
You know what I hate?
You've got this wrong.
Are we done now?
You've got nothing on me.
Your government needs you.
Who else would have this kind of budget?
It's your lucky day.
Let me tell you what the problem is.
I can deal with that.
Alright do what you want.
That could be either good or bad.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
That's exactly why we need them.
I've seen enough.
You've done that before.
I'll go in with a team.
One of their own.
Let me take care of it.
He was the best there was.
Whatever it is it cost him his life.
I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
What do you get if you finish?
Just about anything I want it looks like.
There's no way to save this game.
What game is that?
By then it's too late!
No it's like a safety.
I'm sick of that guy.
Let's stop playing nice.
Go to the water it's that way!
They'll believe me.
We'll have to go after them.
No now it's about us.
Hey hold on!
We're getting out of this place.
We've done enough.
Come on right now.
I could tell where you were in the room.
I'm not much help anyway remember?
Get your head back in the game.
So I stay and I wait like I was told.
What the hell have you been doing?
We've got to find out what it is.
No something worse.
I want you to go out the back.
That's alright I'll figure something out.
Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
It's a long story but yeah more or less.
They made you.
Tell me if it's true.
So there you have it.
That I'd like to see.
We could work together.
Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here.
What can you do about it?
I know where he's coming from.
That's how you eat?
You're not like them I can see it in your eyes.
Maybe we should start again yes?
I know exactly what you're doing.
You'll put a guy right off you.
Your business is finished you should go home.
That's it right?
Mind your business.
Is she for real?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
He had two days.
I think I'll hang on to these.
Right away sir anything you say sir.
Alright here's the story.
That's would be me.
I'm looking for what's his name.
You're wrong about that.
I thought this is what you wanted.
Of course I'm serious.
You never plan for anything.
Alright so I'll get more.
Do you know how expensive it is down there?
But hey if this is about money...
They came and found me.
These things happen.
You got played so what?
You're new at this.
Is this what you're looking for?
They're all over the place!
It's like you said every man for himself.
Help me with this guy.
What's this thing on my back?
You both could have been a part of it.
You used to stand for something.
What happened to you man?
I thought you'd get it.
Sure if that's what you want.
Pretty soon everyone's involved.
You think I'm after money?
I told you my friend.
Not bad man not bad.
You put things together quick.
Did you miss us that much?
Just pick a girl.
Did you join the service as well?
It's been good to me.
You really know how to live.
You got it man.
It's stupid but it's true.
That's when you know you're living man.
It's everybody does what he wants.
That's what I'm talking about man!
Had to do what I had to do.
He must be with you.
From me to you.
Ten to start.
We seen all your shit!
So you want cars?
We get whatever cars you need.
Thanks but I'm here on business.
I'm looking for some cars expensive ones.
A lot of them.
Whatever you want the rest of the night consider it on the house.
No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out.
How did you pick him out?
Never seen him before.
I wish I could go.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.
I'm not strong enough.
It's too far.
I'm taking her down.
You saw what happened tonight.
You know you --
Yeah I'll bet you have.
Are you interested in me?
Were you now?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He's busy right now.
Anything else I can get you?
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
We are not what you think.
Not all of us.
I was afraid if I went to a hospital they would...
Whatever you do to me...
no matter what you'll make me right.
Who are you...
We are the future...
You think I care about her?
I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
You have a home here now if you want it.
They're all asking how you're doing.
We were friends once...
But that was a long time ago.
That's me talking.
It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
What if it never happens?
The point of what?
Forty-eight hours old man.
I'm not sure why but until we find out I must ask you to stay.
What did she do to me?
Enough for a test.
Only a piece.
Is that what you're looking for?
Take you all away?
I just needed...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
But you leave me no choice.
What do you mean to do?
If I could make you understand.
If you could just be made to see it the way I do.
Leave him to me.
What is it like these days?
What do you want with him?
You should do the same.
Yes my dear he is.
What say you to that?
How say you?
And who might you be?
You have the wrong house.
It will never happen again.
But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
From your office sir.
and by God it shall be done!
Yes sir he was.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Did you see?...
Is it that music?
seven's always been my lucky number.
What in God's name are you doing?
That's my good boy.
Is it worth taking a chance?
stay here with you.
Is your room just down the hall?
Now come along like a good boy.
Come to bed darling.
I just meant...
I mean it's been a long day.
Does that mean you love me?
but it still comes to three thousand.
Whatever makes you happy.
Oh darling -- so will I.
Call me from New York before you leave??
you will be careful!?
we'll see.
There seem to be quite a few books.
May I have it please?
I'll leave it on the table here.
Saturday night yes sir.
Saturday night then!
Well thank you very much for all your trouble.
One week -- I'll see to it sir.
One week at the most!?
I'll have to think it over.
It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Ten days at most.
How long will this whole thing take?
Do you have a hundred thousand of them sir?
Dead is Dead!
There's only one thing I am interested in...
My dear young man...
How old are you young man?
Yes but sir...
My father was a sick man.
A piece of what?
Are there any more questions before we leave?
That's true!
But I hope you know what you're doing.
Are you sure you want to go through with it?
How do we get him here?
The only hope now is to get him back here.
That's what we're paid for.
for all your help.
if you get here on time.
Can you play it?
All right -- where is she?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
That whole thing!
I'm not trying to be funny.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
It's trying to talk.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Oh do you like it?
Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I'm not that sort you know.
You've been a great help to me and I've let you down.
Cold and dead!
But there must be a reason.
More do you hear me?
This guy means business.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him.
What if he's not there?
Was he any good???
Was he any good?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
You know what to do!
Could be worse!
Taking the book along?
Must be the music room.
Did you see anyone else down here?
It seems that way.
Just putting up some tea.
But what you were doing?
I wonder what's got into them?
I thought you wanted to.
Yes just the two.
Are you putting me on?
It's -- moving!
It's -- standing!
Oh just a little.
Is this really you???
Are you ready for me?
Three times a day -- anything!
perhaps for a few minutes.
yes you have yours.
Yes I have mine.
But after all you have yours.
I know that I have mine.
or to me.
There can never...
You know that dear.
Oh a little.
as I have you.
What's wrong Doctor?
Terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible!
how wonderful for you.
Good night Doctor.
Are you serious??
All right -- give it to him!
Yes -- quickly dear!
I think I'll...
What do you think we should do?
I thought it was wonderful.
you're not only a great doctor you're a great...
you're almost a...
And look at this Doctor!
Perhaps we'd better leave.
But who was playing it?
Let me come with you Doctor please!
Whatever it is it's coming from down there.
What could it be at this hour?
Is something wrong Doctor?
Yes you may...
I suppose it would be all right for just a little while.
That's quite all right.
What is it dear?
Nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not sure I...
Oh must be around ten...
Three minutes to go!
How long is it so far?
How do you know they're done?
Look how far we've come.
There must have been someone else down here then.
Now just one moment.
Yes sir name please?
They might just be waiting there for us to show up...
Will you hear ""Last Post"" Sir?
I think we'll eat here.
Tell what you see.
Write it well Sir and make sure you get it right
Do you understand me clearly?
But will they make good use of them?
It'll take a little while.
Well that one.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
