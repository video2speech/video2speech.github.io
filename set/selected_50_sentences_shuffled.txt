So I think there is exposure for it
But the case is not on trial now
It is about the exposure in this case
But they did not confirm it
That is what we do for you
We do not know if it is the case
The judge did not get your point in the trial
I think there is exposure in this litigation
We have to confirm the signature for the client
Yes I will confirm your case with them
Do you know when we can get it
I think there is no exposure for the client
What do we know about the case now
So can you get the point now
I do not know if you did it
We have to think about litigation
So I can get your signature
Yes I will get your signature and confirm it
But I did not think about that
I think that the client is in litigation
Do you know when they will get it
But I do not know the schedule for the trial
We think the case is not about exposure
We can do it now if you confirm
We are in litigation on that point
No we can not do it for now
Do you know when they will schedule it
I do not think the client is on trial
I will confirm if you can do it
If you think it is the case you can confirm
The client and I will get on that
The point is to have them there
I do not know if it is for us
They have exposure in this case
Yes I will get them on the trial schedule
Yes I think they are in the trial schedule
But we think it is not for us
My client will confirm the schedule with you
I do not know if it is there
We will do it if you confirm
They did not confirm the schedule with us
They did not get the signature in the trial
I think that it is not your case
You and I are in the trial
No there is no exposure for us in this appeal
Confirm with the judge if there is no trial
When will the judge get the appeal 
When will we get the schedule for my client
I do not know if they will do it
I do not know what that is
