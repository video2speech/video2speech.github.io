Then that's all you had to say.
Where did he go?
He was just here.
It's just you.
Why didn't you tell me?
So I did it.
I don't get you.
Can we go now?
What do you think?
Where've you been?
And where're you going?
That's what I just said
What'd you do to her?
Then go get her
So what does that give me?
What've you got for me?
And why would I do that?
How'd you do it?
It's about time.
I'm on it
I'll get right on it.
I want you to go out with her.
What'd he say?
You think this'll work?
I have no say at all.
You could always go with me.
He always look so
What was it like?
It wasn't like that.
It's just something I had.
Because I don't want to.
You know what I mean
You up for it?
It's not that bad
What are you doing here?
Oh so now you think you know me?
I should do this.
No you weren't
You know what they say
Why 're you doing this?
You're not okay.
Why don't you?
That's what you want isn't it?
I know a lot more than that
You don't know what you want.
Or do I have some time to think about it?
That's where we can help you.
Did I have anything to say about it?
What is it now?
But you're never here!
How could I be?
Is it not so?
What does he say?
This time with me!
There'll be a time.
I want to go with you!
What do you see?
Look what they did!
And if you don't I will.
I cannot be other than I am.
Have you anything to say?
We don't need to know.
What's he doing?
You tell that to them!
You don't know anything!
You think I don't know that?
Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
That's what he did to me.
Give me another one please.
Why you're here.
Say yes or no.
No he is here.
I was all of these.
I'm coming with him.
Yes come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
What do you need?
I have your money.
What are you doing?
I'll make some for us.
You don't know.
That's not me.
I had no money.
You know these people?
I didn't see anything.
Did you take one too?
They were just here.
Did you tell him you did?
You know I don't know.
That's how you help her.
And I get more done because of it.
Is that all there is?
But what if it does?
You might need my help.
I'll come with you.
Well just so you know.
You can do what you want.
No what is it?
You know what that is right?
What do you want?
I'll do that.
Tell me what you want to say.
What am I going to do with you?
You could give me something.
Now's not a good time.
We don't know.
There's a lot to be done.
It doesn't work that way.
You'll be my first.
Is he with you?
This all you want?
No I don't get that!
Look - here we are!
Why do you say I and not we?
But what good is money there?
Oh - I got it.
What does it look like?
I'll do it.
We have no money.
Just do what I do.
Say the same thing I say.
Yes the money is good.
Where's the money?
What do you mean you know?
What are you coming here to do?
How do you know one another?
I'll take him.
Look I don't have time for you get out of my way!
Aren't you tired?
Don't you get it?
Look I'm in here.
How could I know.
I hope we can.
It's the last one.
I don't know.
How's it going?
Yes I don't know what to make of it.
Well that's something.
Yes I thought so.
Okay come on down.
Yes I know that.
Well what is it?
Well I have to go now.
Well how's it going back there?
Oh thank you very much.
Yes I think so.
Yes really thank you very much.
What do you mean?
Oh no thank you.
Is there anything we can do for you?
It's the only thing I know.
Just do what I say okay?
I'd do it but I got to go.
And I don't think I will.
No you don't.
It's your money.
Got all my money.
Yeah I see her.
He's going to need it.
Just tell me about the money.
You have a good time?
I'll think about it.
Didn't work out that way.
I didn't have the time.
You couldn't get to him?
I don't like it.
I want it back.
Doesn't look like it.
Who are all these?
I'll help you out.
I think you do know where he is.
That's what I always say.
What do I know?
How do you know?
I can see that.
I don't know when I can get there.
I'm not like you.
That's the way I see it too.
What do you want to know?
I make you feel good.
You make me feel good.
What'd you do?
How would you know?
I didn't do anything.
I can get you the money.
I'll got your money to you.
Not bad not bad.
That's what I thought.
Thank you very much.
So you do know her.
He's a she!
What are we going to do?
Now all we need is a way to get there.
What's she doing?
I need to know.
I don't know!
I don't need one.
How do I look?
What did you say?
What did you do?
I'll be right back.
One to the right.
What was he like?
I'm not going.
Why would you need me?
There is no need for me other than this.
You can do it!
How does it work?
No not at all!
Do I look bad?
I'll be right with you.
What's going on?
She's all I've got.
I don't know what to say
Look where we are.
I couldn't do that.
I'm on my way.
It was just something I was doing for money.
Because we're going there.
I want to know.
Okay we'll come back to that.
I know what you did.
Yeah who's this?
You'll get it when we get there.
He did it because he could.
Yes I do have something to say.
It's not my money.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
would I be if I didn't go with you?
You don't need to be here.
How much do you make now?
How will I get it to you?
I've thought about it and there's no other way.
I didn't know what to think.
I have to tell you something.
There wasn't one.
We're all like that.
There wasn't anything like that.
It got to be too much for him.
Why do you think he did it?
Want to know what it's really like?
I'll do what I can.
Okay I'll take it all.
Was it a bad one?
I don't want to.
It's okay we're just about there.
I want to help you.
You don't really get it.
I don't think so.
Is there something we can do?
So what's up?
I don't get it.
You're just tired.
We're with you.
Well I've thought about it.
No you're not.
How come you don't think about me?
How did you know that?
Don't do that!
I've got to go.
No I'm not.
What do you think I'm doing?
How's he doing it?
What's that got to do with it?
Where are you going?
There's a lot to tell.
I thought about that.
Oh what's that?
Aren't you going in?
But if they do?
He'll be all right.
I'm with you!
You know - it is?
Why don't you go back up and -
I think you're right.
A lot of people think like that.
Is there any way out of it?
Why do you say that?
That's what I said!
It'll be all right.
All right - go to it.
I'll be another!
Well I'll be - !
But I'm okay.
I know about that.
He's on to us!
Just say it that's all.
You'll get your money.
If you get it?
What do you mean I got money?
I know you did.
So we'll get what you want.
What do you want then?
What do you say?
It's bad for you.
Are we going in this?
Come and get you!
She said she'd come and get me.
I don't want to be here.
I don't like it here.
It's not that.
To us it was.
Why do they do that?
They're still out.
You two don't you get it?
What do I have to do for it?
You don't know how bad or anything?
How would I know?
Got here just in time.
What have I done?
She'll be right out.
Where is she now?
I know who it is.
Did you tell them?
That we were coming?
Work it out with her tell her how you feel.
You don't mean that.
How's she doing?
No he's out now.
It don't look right.
I don't know you.
You don't know me.
You don't know me!
You think you can take me now?
You want me to get her?
You got something to say say it!
That's what you think.
It wasn't me.
I did didn't I?
No no I haven't.
Don't think about it.
No it's okay.
Do you see them?
Okay it's on.
I'll take you all the way in.
I'm doing what I can.
We don't know that.
Can we do that?
Where are we now?
We're not going to make it.
why did they do that?
She's right here.
I mean they're people.
What do you want with us?
Yes I'll do it.
You'll do it?
I'll be back.
We're right here.
Don't take it.
Did you feel that?
I have to get in there.
That's the way I want it.
If that's the way you want it.
It's all here!
I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's how I want them.
What should I say?
We don't have much time.
I'll take a look at it.
Can I be of some help?
That's very nice of you.
Yeah something like that but as I say they didn't have time to tell me very much.
No one that I know of.
What did he have?
Could you come and take a look at them?
I don't have time now.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Yeah I think he is.
Can you do something please?
Would you go up please?
I wouldn't know anything about it.
She did did she?
He's not here.
You look very good.
No he's not.
I know that look.
Where did he get it?
What was that about?
I didn't get a good look at him.
Where'd you get this?!
Yeah that's it.
That was a good one.
Why'd I do what?
Why did you do it?
She didn't know him.
You need this for anything?
I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
That's all I know.
What about the other one?
Did you know him?
That's the way these people are.
Don't tell me what to think.
How can I go?
What'll you need?
That's not what I mean.
I hope you're right.
Just go would you.
It's all I could get.
There's no way!
Look we don't know what's going on out there.
How do you feel?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!
I only work here.
He's coming in.
We'd know about it.
They'll get us.
But they don't know that.
They're in here.
They're right on us.
Just get back here!
Think of a way.
Yes there are aren't there.
I know they would.
Because I don't have to.
Look I can see where this is going.
What does he look like?
I want to be in it.
How do you like it?
No no no no.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I want to go!
He's all right.
How much is it?
We need money now.
You're not going to do this?
How much will you give him now?
And then you think you can -
What does she want?
Tell them to go!
I don't need them.
All they want to see is your work.
Well don't do that again!
No they will not.
Just say it - you'll see.
Now we are going back.
No he doesn't.
And I don't want you here.
Well thank you very much.
You can go now.
It's up to you.
I have other things you might like.
You see he doesn't know I'm here.
How can I help you?
Oh yes and who are you?
He's not in.
He said to tell you.
And so you do!
Do you know who I am?
Well look at them.
Well there it is.
Would you tell me why?
It's very good.
So then you like it?
Well what is it about?
Yes what about him?
I'll do anything you say!
I thought I did.
They get in the way.
She had to go - yes!
Yes she's like that.
Is she not here?
Why are you here?
You don't know what it's like.
Where does he work?
Does he work at all?
Can I see it?
What have you got for me?
Put it down I said!
So there you are.
What did he say?
What can I do for you?
Who do you think it is?
I'm not tired at all.
Do you have it?
And that's it.
Yes yes - go on.
Do you have me?
And that's all?
Do you have that?
Tell me what is this work?
Can I - could I help you in any way?
No it's him!
Do you mean that?
You're so good to me.
You mean she's not coming back?
I have to get back.
You're not well.
Did my work please you?
How could I not?
It was good of you to come.
I know I know.
Why didn't they come?
Did you like it at all?
But what is it they don't like?
I don't know why.
You are the first to know.
I don't have to tell you how much I need your help.
Did you like it then?
What does that mean?
No you didn't!
How does one do that?
Oh yes yes yes yes yes!
Go on tell me!
That is all you need to know.
You cannot say that!
All the same why him?
You know who that is?
Oh I know that!
I'm here only for you.
Well I don't know!
What do you mean - now?
What does he want?
She didn't say.
But he's all right?
Can we come in?
How did he look?
But it's something to do.
Yes I should think so.
Is he all right?
I've got to do something!
I don't know why I feel so good.
But you know what?
Yeah I do but go to work.
It's nice to see you.
Yeah I would think so too.
I would think so.
What do I think?
Will you be all right?
Will you think about it?
Will you come with me?
Can I get you something?
Do you like it?
Well all right then be that way.
Yes I should think.
You did did you?
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh come on tell us.
No but we're about to.
What are you going to see?
What time is it?
I really don't know.
I didn't mean it.
You don't have to say anything.
You've got to know.
So you know what she does?
This is too much.
Nice to see you.
Are you going to help me up?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Could be a lot of things.
Well I like it here.
Oh I don't know.
Come in come in.
Tell him I'm out.
What can I get you?
I'll tell you why.
I want to know why .
I was the first one to see it.
Where do you think I've been?
What good will that do?
That's what good it will do!
You know what you can do with that!
Come on take a look at this!
Do anything you want with it.
There's one way you can get it.
What do you mean help?
That's all very well.
I'll tell you.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Get out get out!
What was she doing there?
Why I couldn't do that .
That don't do us any good.
I haven't got it.
Don't you know?
Not when you are there.
Yes yes it does.
Not bad not bad at all.
Do you know something?
Here here here now!
Don't you go back to work on me too.
Now get out of here!
Well that's too bad.
I feel all right too.
That's all there is to it.
What have I done now?
Well look who's here!
It's not for you.
Where is he now?
They think he did it!
What are we going to do about it?
Why I don't know.
I haven't any.
But I haven't .
She was wasn't she?
All you've got to do is
Now come on tell me.
Now come on I know you didn't do it.
A lot of them didn't think you would.
It's all right.
What's she got to do with you?
He had no more to do with it than you did.
If he can do it yes.
What's going on here?
Don't you think I know it?
What'll we do?
What did you do with it?
Oh is that so?
What time was it?
Then where were you?
What time did you get in?
I didn't do it!
Now you tell us.
He's not bad at it.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
Never a good thing.
Because we were good at it?
She got two of them.
All right all right.
Why didn't you just say so?
It got to you didn't it.
You need it now.
And we're good at it.
How'd it go out here?
How'd it go in there?
Didn't think you would.
That just might work.
So what was he?
I've got you.
I had to see you.
You shouldn't be up.
We want to help.
That's what I would have done.
That's nice to know.
Didn't help much.
How can that be?
How did you know?
They are not the same thing.
Oh no I would have done that.
You wouldn't have done that?
Is it a what?
You like it there don't you?
I have to go.
It's not that nice.
I've thought about that.
You can have them.
I don't think it would work.
You don't have to work.
We should do it.
Don't come back.
I think you should go now.
I mean yes I did.
Can I help you?
It's just not.
That was you wasn't it?
It's not me.
They don't know that.
What are I doing?
You're right I should go.
I know I should go.
I don't know Not really.
Where do you want to go?
You don't like this I take it?
I'll make them.
And what should I say?
I really don't.
What do you think I do?
So what do you do?
I'm at work all the time.
Oh I get it.
Coming all the way up here but you know.
I thought that was you.
Does he do this all the time?
Don't tell him you're here.
So who was he with?
I'll be there.
I'm with you on that one.
That's not what I've got.
I didn't know that.
Don't you know this?
Do you feel that way?
How well did you know him?
Oh no I'm okay.
No I'm okay.
Do you know that?
I'll help you.
From people who do work?
I know that I know that.
You're not what?
Why don't you get another one?
How did you get it?
Oh well you know.
You know what he's like.
You know what I mean.
To tell her how I feel about you.
It's what they said it is.
What did you see in there?
I know how to get in there.
I think we should just go.
It's the way he said it.
Not like him is it?
Can you help me?
I feel the same way.
I hope you know what you mean to me.
Not just because of what you're doing.
Because of who you are.
It's going well!
Take a look at this.
I look at you and see the things that got me here.
When would we come?
I want him to like me.
I think you should go.
Now what are we doing?
Please don't go.
Does he know you know?
You'll come up with something.
I know what he did to you.
You thought about it too.
But not right now.
What've you got there?
No I know what you mean.
You can go back and make it all work.
Did I say something?
Some of us who got to good at this?
I could get it out of him.
What's the other?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Just where you'd never think to look for him.
We'll be there.
I have something to tell you.
You go get help.
What do we do now?
Give it to me.
All right I get it.
I'll tell him.
I didn't see that one coming.
Oh yes you are.
I don't know how to put this really.
You didn't see a thing!
We've got a lot of work to do.
What do we have?
Yes what is it?
You just don't get it do you?
You always do that!
I just don't see it.
And how do you feel about that?
You don't say.
Would that I could say the Same.
I might as well.
Have a look at this.
Here have one of these.
You didn't tell her?
Aren't you coming?
I thought you didn't.
Is that what you think?
Not that I know of.
Is there anything that isn't?
Did he say who?
Why should they think that?
I might say the same.
I wasn't about to.
Not me you should thank.
Do you really think so?
Please don't get up.
I know all this.
We know one thing.
Oh yes I did.
If you say so.
I'm good at it.
I'll go with you.
You've had it.
She'll always be.
See that down there?
But how can I do that?
Do it for me.
Then why are you coming back to me?
Here's a thought.
Now what do you want to do about it?
I don't want that.
I want to be with you.
Have a good time.
Wouldn't think of it.
I got something for that.
Well what do you think?
That's more like it.
What can I tell you?
I'll take some.
What can I be doing for you?
Just go out there.
I see you're right.
Be good for you.
How are we doing?
What can I do?
What are you going to do about it?
How'd it go?
Why didn't you go for it just now?
This isn't right.
Where'd she go?
Not with this one.
What are we going to do about this?
I put it there!
And I didn't do it.
What have you got to do?
Well you know what?
I really should get back.
Where did he tell you that?
And what if there'd been two?
It's my way.
So that's it?
Doesn't work on you.
Well look what we have here.
It doesn't go like that.
What'll you do?
I don't know anything about it.
What have you been up to?
That's how you know him.
Who's doing this?
Why should I take you back?
You think I did?
So what do you want me to do?
No it couldn't.
You think you're the first?
I don't want you in my way.
Are you still here?
And you know what?
Do you have to do that?
How'd you know?
He never does it right.
When was the last time?
You always have to be right.
I know he's out but how's he doing?
I just thought I should say I don't know something.
How's he doing?
You don't know him.
Didn't think you'd make it.
I got something for you.
So what are you doing here?
I've been bad.
It's still my money.
I want my money.
Never any other way.
I don't got it.
Do you have the money?
I'm on it.
Need I say more.
Can you do this for me?
So now I see where you're coming from.
What do you do?
What do I do?
So that's what you been doing?
You might be right.
That can be done.
You know what that is don't you?
What about in the mean time?
We was coming to see you.
What do I have to do?
Well do something about it.
Don't you people get it?
Do you want it that much.
You can have that.
That's so tired.
I want you take it there.
You know how I know?
What is it you want from me?
Where do you go from here?
So what's up with you?
The first and only time.
Please don't go there.
Why'd you do that?
It's all good.
Is that good or bad?
What do you want me to say?
How can this be?
Oh is that what I'm doing?
I'm doing okay.
Where are you from?
That's the way I want to feel about my work.
How do you see all of this?
I don't know who I am.
That's what I like about you and me.
And so I am.
I have said all there is to be said.
It will come out well for me.
You will do as you please.
Have you had one?
Well then I'll tell you what I'd do.
What is to be done?
When is he to go?
What do we do?
We can still come out of this okay.
He's too good.
Oh you don't?
Well why didn't you say so?
Tell me about them.
What do you like then?
I just don't like it.
How do you know that?
Is that what I did now?
No did he tell you about it?
Why didn't you come?
What don't you know?
If not you then who?
It's not in me.
What do you think of that?
Tell me what I can do.
But he was a lot of other things too.
Think it'll work?
What are you doing out here?
But I don't think so.
What if I don't want it?
No I didn't.
Yeah I could've.
Didn't really work out.
You want to tell me what's going on?
We should tell him we're not going.
It will and you know why?
But you didn't see it right?
You think he did it?
There's only one I want.
You just have to tell me who she is.
He's still here.
I'll tell you all about it.
Can I see him?
It's good to see you.
I can get it.
I thank you for your time.
What did she look like?
And I like you.
What did she say?
So what do you say?
You don't like it?
What do you want Will?
Who do you want me to be?
That's all I do Will.
Oh so you know.
I said this isn't how I go.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
This isn't how I go.
You think I'm up for it?
Did you do any of that?
I can tell them as well as you can.
Go out with me.
So what are you up to now?
Look I don't know how much you want to know about any of this.
And you're Will.
I could feel it.
Is he going to be okay?
Look I know why you like him.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
You need to go.
It's more than they thought.
Do you know who that is?
No it's not.
Just the same as you two.
Yes Will I do.
You didn't need to do that.
You just didn't.
How did you get here?
Yeah it was okay.
No I don't.
You know what for.
No I haven't.
We'll go down there.
I'll give him money.
What does he want.
What do you want ?
Tell me what he said.
Yes it's okay.
This is for you.
I need to know who you are first please.
What does it mean?
Tell me about it.
This will be my last one.
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know why I said that.
Well what have you got?
You don't have to say anything
So what did you want?
He will come back.
But you know so what?
I said I don't have any.
I don't have any money.
Give me some money.
You don't have to do this.
So what are you going to do?
I don't want to know.
I didn't know what to do.
Can I come in?
That'd be nice.
Well that's good.
You didn't have to do this.
I don't know what to do.
I know about how she was like.
This don't feel right.
That's just not good.
And this how you do me!
And that's what you did.
I mean that's it.
No you do it.
I know you didn't.
Tell me what to do.
I'm here with you.
Well get to it.
What do you know how to make?
Now you get up!
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!
Do me like this you mean?
Why you say that?
I just know how you get.
That's what she said.
And tell him how you feel.
You could put it that way.
I'm a what?
Just about anything you know.
You know how I get.
I'll be okay.
Don't do that.
Can you see that?
I know I did.
You need money again?
What'd I tell you?
You got any money?
I don't think he'd feel it.
I didn't know.
What'd you say?
That's what they say.
What are they doing now?
What'd she say?
If you give me one.
What's that for?
I couldn't tell.
You don't have to come.
Did I say that?
How'd you get this?
I don't that's all.
I'd like that.
Tell them I'm not.
Don't give him any more.
Then take it from him.
What if I say no?
They want him first.
Then we can have him.
Because I want you to tell me.
Do you know what this is?
I don't have to.
If I say no?
Why tell me this?
Then go get him.
Put it this way.
But not to last.
And what can he do for you?
You could help us.
Well no not really.
I want to do it.
What's going on down there?
If you don't we will.
Okay here it is.
She's not with you?
You didn't like her!
I didn't like her.
When might that be?
I know all that.
I'm coming to that.
Are you with me?
I like you too.
I'll but you one.
What'll you have?
I think I have no money.
So how are you doing?
But if you could?
Why didn't you go?
I didn't say that.
What did she want?
And who do I go to about you?
You know what I think?
Because it's not.
How are you doing?
What do you want me to do?
I think you need more help than you've got.
Why should I be?
You know where I been.
She didn't know?
I'm tired of this.
How do you know I'm not?
But how come I'd be there?
Is that why you're still here?
I don't have one.
You would like her very much!
No I'm not!
Very well thank you.
How do you do?
Well isn't he?
Well you should be!
And what do I say?
No it's not!
It's that way!
It's in there.
I wouldn't know.
This is for me.
I'm going to need all of this!
Why not go to work for me?
Why does it never work out?
Why doesn't it never work out?
What have you been doing?
Don't do it!
Why are you doing that?
So here take it back.
I thought I'd never see you again!
And that's it?
I've got two of him!
Yes I'm right?
Oh that's nice.
Why doesn't it?
No you get out of here.
Get out of here!
Will you be back?
Would you like some money?
I've got to go now.
Are you all right?
Well do we just go on up?
Then why go there?
He's out there!
Can I have them?
I know what you mean!
I'll be right back!
I just don't want to.
Well you're right.
When did we get it from them?
You've been very very nice.
I don't see anything!
How much are they?
Well we're here to help!
We have to go.
Then we'll be back to get you.
I just hope this is still good up there.
I'll be all right.
I'll go up.
A nice one I hope.
You know I don't think so.
I have to go!
I can be anything you want me to be!
We're not going to make do.
We'll make do.
So what do we do now?
Yes yes it is!
If we still have one.
We'll know then.
What a thing to say!
What are you doing back here?
I think it's just right.
Now it's time.
We'll do this again!
Well put it down and come in!
Where did you go?
I like to think so.
And what do you do?
Give it back to him.
What do you want to do with it?
You did the right thing.
What are you going to do?
Please don't tell me that!
What's it to you?
What's that mean?
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.
You don't see that?
That's all he'll say.
Yeah that's it!
This is all I have.
Oh here they are.
Yes it's me!!!
No not at all.
Okay come on in.
Why do you do it?
Anything you can tell me?
It's on my way.
Where have you been?
Yeah it's me.
There's so much I want to tell you.
I do I do.
Did you know that?
That wouldn't be too good would it?
Do you want to do bad things?
I'm doing it.
What do you want to do?
Or do you just want me?
Are you in with them?
You think you know so much.
There you go again.
You can make it.
Who's it you mean.
Why are you here.
Don't say that.
I didn't mean it or did I?
Yes I like you.
Do you like me?
Do you like the way I feel?
I'll go then.
I don't like that.
Do you like that?
I I don't know.
What do you want from me?
NO you come on.
I want to see you.
That's what I said.
I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Just to see if I could do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!!!
Oh yeah that's good.
You'll see I'll get you.
No way get out.
He didn't mean it.
If you want to.
You want to see him too right?
He had to have her.
To make her do things.
I don't want to go.
It would be too much for him.
No you're right.
Yes I'm going.
What was that all about?
You didn't tell him about me?
Yeah but I don't think it's going to do much good.
What am I going to do?
You want to tell me about it?
What did you see?
Well how did it go?
I'll see you.
It'll be okay.
What do want me to do?
You really want to do this don't you?
Now how are you going to do that?
I'm here aren't I?
Do you know anything?
That's too bad.
What are you doing now?
I just know that's all.
Yeah how did you know?
I mean it now.
That's just not the way things are done.
What did you do?!
Where'd you get them?
Well you know how it is with him.
I'll see what I can do.
Know anything about that?
So what do you think?
Did you tell him?
Oh you're good.
I don't know they just always need it.
Well we didn't get any help on that.
Don't have much on him.
He was the only one done right.
Really want to know?
and think about it.
We have to go now.
This is the last time I'll see you.
If you think about it it's all you can do really.
I'll help them.
They would never do that.
I didn't see.
Don't look at me!
What's he in for?
What can I say?
So how is it in there?
What'd he get?
I'll get him.
I'll see you there.
It's going back down.
He was all right.
I don't think you will.
Get out of the way.
What time did he say to be here?
I want you to look at this.
When'd you get back?
That's what she is!
No one to back me up.
She doesn't need to know.
I know we can.
I don't think we can do that.
Would of been nice.
Why don't you come with us.
Well I didn't do it did I?
What were you going to do?
When'd he tell you?
Get back to me on that one.
I'll say it.
I'll just say it.
Is it back in?
But he didn't say anything.
That's not bad.
Did you see that?
There's just not time for it.
Would they do that?
He's not there.
And there was no one there to help me.
Why'd you want to help us?
It's what you are.
I mean I don't think about it all the time.
What's it all about?
How'd he do?
How does that feel?
You I can work with.
I don't know anything.
Where's he going?
Where'd they come from?
Did he see us?
What's he doing here?
I don't know about that.
How's it look back there?
What you been up to?
I know it's not.
I'm going back.
What do you mean get back?
We'll have to see when we get back.
There were more than that.
How much is there?
Did we get it?
He doesn't get it.
The money and the people.
I'm going to take a look at this.
I know that now.
What did I say?
You should take a look.
As much as I want.
So who's going to know?
And I don't see it like that.
This is no good.
Good to see you.
What can we do?
Why did he go that way?
Had to be done.
It was just money.
Did he say anything to you?
So what's he doing?
And what about her?
I think I do.
Where's he now?
It had to be done.
To know about it?
I had to tell you right?
And it's still going on.
I have to go now.
You know I'm not.
I would want to know.
She really did that?
I mean for us.
I don't know who that is.
I like it here.
What if it's not who you think it is?
I'll come back.
I don't mean that.
So when was I here?
Why are you here then?
They know it's you!
How do they know that?
How can they know any of that?
They know you were here.
They don't know what it is but they know!
Don't need it.
Okay how do you want to do it?
I want to come in.
We need to get in there.
Is he coming in?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do.
He's coming for us.
And why is that?
Look what do you want me to say?
You're coming with us.
And what about you anything?
Here's what I've got.
What are they doing?
I know he will.
I said LOOK AT ME!
We're going too.
This is the only way.
Good to see you again.
I will be with you like this.
And I'll come again.
It's not you.
I need you so much!
And I with you.
How do you know this?
It does me good to see you.
And so would I.
I want what you want!
Now what do we do?
How much time have I got?
These things take time.
What could he do?
What were you doing with that?
You'll like him.
Please can we go?
But I'm not so bad am I?
What did it look like?
For you to help me.
What do you see now?
Where are you now?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
I just thought you should know.
I never thought you would.
I've been where you've been.
Nice to see you too.
Now's the only time!
It's not the time.
Something's not right.
Why are you doing all this for me?
I don't know what to say.
Things are going okay.
I never thought I'd see you again.
How've you been?
Been there done that.
Where did we all go?
But it didn't.
What do you need it for?
So we'll see.
That would be all right wouldn't it?
Does he know that?
It was much more than we thought to get here.
How did you get in here?
Yes I come I will do it.
That's all right.
Do you know where they are?
And you never will.
But what about us?
But it's all right isn't it?
All right I will.
I've got them right here.
Get them for me.
You'd say anything now to get what you want.
How did you get in?
You'll be there.
Well you can tell me now.
Why did you come back?
Who are you really?
What did you do and what did you think?
When will he be back?
Yes Yes I know.
You know what I have been doing.
You see here we are again.
We'll come again.
What is it you want?
Yes much too good a time.
You see what I mean?
I see what you mean.
It's very good to be here.
Well I was right.
You didn't come here to tell me this.
Oh how do you do?
He'll take one.
I'd like to get it back.
You would like to be on it?
That's not so bad.
I'll have another please.
One in one out.
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.
I'm always going on about me me me.
They'll never see you.
They're never going to see you.
They'll be back.
You don't know where you are.
that was the last one.
Want to come in?
I had to come.
What will you do?
No one back here does.
I didn't want to.
I would have done the same thing.
I thought you might have.
Right back you said you'd be right back.
Be who you are right now.
There isn't any us.
But I have to go.
Tell me all of it.
I just want out of here.
Yes yes he did.
If you say you are.
I don't have it.
It's still you.
I need to do it.
That's what we do.
That's what it's about.
That's all there is.
Are we on or not?
Just give me the money now.
But I might not have.
I know who you mean.
Do you think she'll be all right?
Please don't make me say it again.
What do you want me to do ?
That would be doing something wouldn't it?
We wouldn't want to do something.
Well we have to help her!
She doesn't feel she can do that.
That's not all there is to it!
That's all there is to it then.
What will be okay?
It will be okay.
Do you want me to go?
I know this was right.
That's what I'd come here for.
I know where you can go.
I know what you've been doing.
Well they aren't.
I thought they might take me.
But did you know him?
I don't have any time.
They wouldn't take me.
Where'd she get you?
If you want I can help you.
They is good for you!
What should I do now?
I'll get this.
You do it then.
He doesn't like it.
I don't know it.
I'd like to go with you.
I know more than I want to know about it.
What do you know about it?
I know how to do it.
We don't know what he is.
I don't want to know him!
Do you know him?
Look at this one!
That's what we say all right.
We don't need no help.
Where do you think you're going?
It's more like what aren't I doing.
Then there it is.
We were back on.
They were right there for you.
She was right there for you!
I was doing it for them.
What do they get?
Isn't it always?
It's all about the money isn't it?
Now that'll be something.
What do you want us to do about it?
We're going to give him the money back?
That's how good he is.
We can still do this!
You'll be there?
She's up for it.
She up for this?
You know what we're doing with the money.
He's not coming back.
What do you need from me?
It's all take take take.
But what can I say?
Take it from me you never do.
Because it is all about the money right?
I want you to have it.
It should have been you.
So there it is.
What about the money?
I don't know who you are!
Not the way I did it.
How do you know I will?
You'll know what to do.
It's more than that.
It's what I do.
I know where it is.
A lot like that one.
What's up with you?
You going to have the time?
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here.
So what do you have for me?
What do you get out of it?
What's he going to do?
But you know that.
But I know where I am.
I'll take you up on that.
Is it that bad?
You don't need to work.
Why don't you come?
I thought it was you.
Why did you take the money?
How did you know I was here?
But not with you.
There's no hope in it.
Is that the way you feel now?
I don't like it at all.
What do I mean to you?
I take it back.
How did it go?
What's the time?
I've got something to tell you.
I can get another.
You shouldn't have done that.
Where did you get it?
That's what you need isn't it?
Well I've got something for you.
I need the money too.
But if it does.
I've come to know you.
It'll never work.
But you can now.
I couldn't help you.
You know where I'm from?
But what could I do?
I don't think I know that one.
I don't know where it is.
What do you have for us now.
Why don't you have more time?
I'm coming in now.
I like it up here.
Are you still there?
It didn't work?
That's not why we're here.
Don't look down.
Where're we going?
I shouldn't do this.
What's with you?
But don't feel bad.
Can you help me get her back?
I couldn't get to her.
I need your help.
That's what you were put here for.
What's in it for you?
You said you could help.
How much do you know?
You need to get out more.
But I had to see you.
How do I know you didn't?
And now they don't.
But she does work here?
You don't want to.
And so should you.
Just give it to me.
How's this about me?
Here's your money.
You get anything on them?
That's all I got.
Now you got something for me or not?
Only one I can think of.
You get it when I get her.
And why should she?
She's as much as said so.
He'll never look there!
I know how we can get in!
I thought it was a nice thing to do.
It doesn't mean anything.
Please tell me you have'm!
I think that you did it.
Now they think I did it.
You have to do something for me first.
Where did you come from?
How can you do that?
What'd you do!
It isn't a good time.
I know she's here.
Will you come see her with me?
I mean will you GO with me?
Will you go with me?
I just don't get this.
I can tell her anything.
A lot of people.
I can see him right now!
You've done it again?
That I did it again.
I just don't get it.
How does that make you feel?
And how do they do this?
So what do I say?
No don't say it.
Now get up there.
Why what could he be doing there?
What did you say to her?
I say something you don't like.
What do I get?
Now - where were we?
That's no good.
That was for you again.
That was for you.
I don't want him.
Well - what is he now?
Give me that again!
I'll tell you what I'll do.
That's where you come in.
But why did I do it?
What was this all for?
Well these things take time.
I just don't know.
I mean I've always thought he was.
I shouldn't be.
Yes very well I think.
Did you see it?
I want him back!
And now I want him back.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
What did you do to him?
Well it's up to us then isn't it?
No we don't.
They don't want him.
No not that way.
Yes I think I can.
Tell me about it please!
You've never been?
I just work there.
I would never think it!
Want to come out?
It's all for you.
Oh no I couldn't.
Because I can take it back.
You did this for me?
Isn't there something you would like to have?
I thought as much.
Who are they of?
What did you think?
Oh no do not say that.
I want you to say them back to me.
I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me.
Thank you so much for coming.
I just take the money.
I know all about it.
Where did you take him?
He'll be there.
I'd like to see it.
It's all right!
She did I tell you!
There IS no one.
I know you're in there!
Why do you go on about that?
What was she like?
PLEASE make them put them down.
You don't know what you're doing!
How do we know this is the way?
You can all see me?
That I cannot tell you.
I shouldn't have come.
They didn't like it!
Oh no no no!
I didn't mean to!
You DON'T like it do you?
Don't you FEEL it?
You there and you there.
I've got you!
There is another way.
We'd be the first!
Well where is he then?
How did he do that?
What do we have to do?
No it is NOT.
Same thing isn't it?
I don't feel BAD about it.
What have you got there?
Oh I couldn't do that!
Yes it is good.
Tell him I'm coming!
He'll be right with you.
I think I know.
I think we can help.
And we'll take it from there.
Should I give it more time?
Well why don't you tell me what's going on?
I wouldn't have thought that.
I think I should go back.
I think we should go.
See what you think.
I know what you mean.
You know what I did.
If you want to be with me you're with me.
Is that what you want?
But you weren't.
What are we doing?
I don't know what to do now.
You know we're okay.
I'm right here.
I want to know you.
No it isn't that.
Look at it out here.
Isn't that how you get people to like you?
How could she have done this to me?
Would you do that?
I would like that.
But right now I should go.
Like it just isn't right with him.
Who wouldn't like that?
You're very nice.
Do you know what I mean?
But I get it.
You're really nice.
I think about that.
I go to work.
But I think I am.
I like to think I am.
Yeah I don't know.
No I'm okay for now.
I'd like to be from then.
I like it too.
That was very nice of you.
I didn't think you were.
I'm not really.
I don't need that.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
No that's okay.
I know it's here.
I don't need nice.
Now I'm nice?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
See I wouldn't think that about you.
Yeah I got it.
That's what I'll do.
Well I'm there.
It's okay really.
No I mean I don't know.
Look I have to go.
I have to think.
That's what you have to say?
You said I do.
I just got in.
I didn't want to go.
I really should go.
Your back to me.
I didn't want to do this.
Is that like us?
And what are you like?
I'm never going to see her again.
How could she do this to me?
That's your look for me.
She did it to me.
There are two of them.
Couldn't make them out.
You never should have.
I hope you get your work done.
They have a right to know.
I know what it is.
How did I look?
I just said that!
Well what should we do?
I don't know what to do!
It's a good one all right.
That's a good one.
I didn't make you.
I want to do the right thing here.
I shouldn't have said that.
How do you mean?
Okay we're back in.
I'll take it from here.
And only I know it.
You can if you want.
I know who you are.
I wouldn't say that.
Oh we didn't get it all the way on.
Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
That doesn't mean anything.
How does she feel about you?
Why do you have to go?
How much do you know about it?
Do not do that!
You weren't there.
No he didn't.
We'll make it.
We all know where we're going.
I have to go with them.
She's come back.
I'm going in.
How do you know all this?
This is not about me at all!
So where are they?
But now we have to go to work.
You're all coming with me.
Then what what are you?
And I think there is.
How much time do you need?
I can see that what're they for?
This is where I need you.
What does it say?
Get out of there now!
Something like that yeah.
That's not it.
And that's the only one I have.
We're all here.
Then what are you doing here?
There's no one here.
Here's another one.
Do you know what it was?
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything.
How'd you know it was me?
You wouldn't say that if you could see me.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't know what it's like out there.
It's not him.
Where do you think?
It's still me.
I'm good as is.
You should be the one up there.
I cannot do it.
You'd never know it.
I don't really know.
And where do we think we're going?
Here we go again.
Now what is up with that?
She's not here.
Yeah for the last time I hope.
What is that thing?
And that's a good thing?
Then what is it?
It's not just the money.
Why didn't you say something?
I'm not the only one in there.
No way to know.
Last time didn't work out so well.
And he's not the only one.
What is that you've got on?
I am so tired.
Give me my money back.
I want my money back right now.
You're not going to tell me are you?
There's only one thing we can do.
All right I take it back.
Didn't you feel it?
I know what I look like.
Are you going to get one?
You just don't know him.'
You want it back?
I think I've got it.
This is what I do.
Here's what you do.
I can see it all now.
Well what do you want me to do?
I don't go at all.
Nice to be here.
But what are you going to do?
He's not coming.
I didn't tell you that.
I'm not going to tell him.
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
I just don't feel right.
He'll be out here.
Well I never did it.
So what did you do?
What should I do?
You can take it.
Don't you like him?
How's it going.
You mean you couldn't?
Or you wouldn't?
I couldn't make it in time.
Is this your first time?
Where do you feel like going?
Do you really have to go?
I'll come in.
Do you know what you want?
I have to get going.
What did they do to her?
I didn't think so.
We should get some of that.
Where'd you get this?
What could they do?
She's got to go.
You'll like it.
You'd do that wouldn't you?
I need it again!
Did you put him on to her?
They didn't have any.
Can we make it?
I want it now.
Look what are we doing here?
Why do you think we're here?
Here's how it is.
Could I have that please?
You and a lot of other people.
I'd do just about anything for that!
I'll help you all you need!
They'll get in!
I don't know I just got here.
Where are you two going?
You know where it is?
Are you two all right?
Did you see that!?
We should go right now!
Come on come on.
I'm not going down there again!
What's it for?
They're right here.
Who's with me?
Yeah the lot's right there.
What's in the back?
We're going to get help.
How much I got what?
How much you got?
What's it for!
What do you mean what?
And what's that?
You all know where that is?
Get something on that.
Yeah I'll go.
She's not very nice is she?
If there is only one way out for us there is only one way in for them.
Okay well that's something.
Did we make it?
I'll do anything to help.
I need to get to her.
You know you don't have to do this.
What're you doing?
Come on it's just what you need!
Okay but come here first.
I tell you I want to give these things!
You didn't tell him did you?
You have no right!
You weren't going to tell me were you?
You know what she'll do.
What do you think I should do?
You really want to go?
I didn't have much to do with it.
I can thank you for that.
Only if you were in it.
That would be okay.
It was very good to see you again.
No we're not.
How nice to see you.
You give up on her?
There's just one more thing.
I don't know how or why but I would.
Look out for me.
Well I would have you know?
You can do that you know?
But I don't want to be like that.
If you give them what they want you can get anything.
No they don't do they?
Is that why you did it?
Why'd they do it?
You can make good money at it.
How'd I look?
What'd you think?
But I'm not.
So who are you then?
You think I got it?
It's in you.
But I want to.
I'm going out!
You know what that's like?
They want you back!
I want you to.
Tell them who I am!
Don't I know you?
It was very good to see her.
What is that to you?
Why do you not go to them?
She's not for you.
You'll make her.
There is something I want.
Do I have one?
What did you want with me?
Then why am I here?
It's not like him.
What about your work?
I'm all right.
If only I could.
Why should it be so?
Oh do give him here!
We'd be out of work.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
And here's to Him.
Only you would think of that!
You know of it?
How is it you come to be here?
We should go now.
It will be all right.
What'd you see?
That's got her.
I'll go take a look.
Not if they're where I think they are.
You can only do what you can do.
Don't get up.
I'm like you.
I never said do what I do I said do what I say.
Didn't think so.
What's this about money?
We've all done it.
Why shouldn't I be?
Why just look at all this.
I never said help us!
I didn't do anything!
I did what you said.
Where are you right now?
You know what you look like?
That's what you look like.
That's what you think?
Yeah I think so.
This is not me!
Do you think this is what I am?
How's that feel?
How's it feel?
What did I tell you?
Okay I'll have one.
How come you're doing this?
Then that's all I have to say.
You know that don't you?
Think we're had.
Come work for me.
That's how it should've been.
Or thought you did.
You don't know that.
Would I be the only one?
Just do it okay?
I've had it.
So here we are again.
Really thank you so much.
Just like you would be.
Last time I didn't.
To get from here to there?
And how do you know that?
That's not right.
Right here right now.
I'll take this one.
Know what I mean?
Wouldn't be a first.
Oh yes he will.
He's not going to do it.
This isn't me.
I don't do things like this.
I know a way.
But I haven't.
I'll take them all.
I've got something on this.
Take me with you.
Is she always like this?
You will have to go and get help!
They didn't make it.
That is when we will go in.
Get your people out of there or I will.
They are with me!
What do we know?
What'd they say?
How do I do that?
I thought there would be more.
So you're in?
Why do you need that?
Do I know you?
What are you doing in there?
There's no time!
You WILL go out there.
I'm doing it!
It just wasn't like him.
But you don't?
Okay that's where you want to be.
Make a right there.
Okay we got it.
We need another one.
What does that mean?!!!
We just don't KNOW it.
Do you know WHY?
Yeah what is it?
Oh I'm not?
Put me back on with him.
Where'd they go?
We shouldn't have to DO this!
Why is it HERE?
Yes I'm here!
I need time to think.
We have no right to do this.
Well you have to tell them.
I'm not going to tell them.
When are you going to tell them?
That's it It's go time.
Oh I don't think so.
Get us out of here!
Because they're coming right at us.
What does she see in them?
They always say that.
Then I need you.
It's what they want.
Well what have you thought?
Will you do it?
But it's more than just that am I right?
How can you say that?
No I did not.
So good to be back!
What can he do?
He's up there.
When we see them.
They're good people.
You never have been.
They really mean it.
And what is this then?
That's not what I said!
How do they get here?
You get the money?
You mean you don't know?
So where's the money?
Why isn't he here?
That's a lot.
Now why would you do that?
Well I don't know.
I have to go get it.
I need the money.
Get something going there.
I'm with you on that.
That's right me.
Yeah where've you been?
You say look at you?
So who are you?
Yeah I'm here.
That's who I am.
Why would I do that?
How'd you get in here?
Get him out've here.
That's what I'd do.
Something shouldn't be there.
What've you got?
I say what I mean.
I said I'd think about it.
They don't know who you are.
What do you get out of this?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
He's in it to make money.
Go on tell her.
That's what I'm doing.
Tell me what you been up to.
I think you got it down.
How do I know that?
If you'd like to tell me yeah.
So you want to know.
How'd you know I was here?
It's not one of these?
Are you going down?
Oh I like him.
That is if you can make it.
Don't go out of your way.
What're you doing here?
What if it was?
I still don't.
Because we can see them.
Yeah what'd he have to say?
And I would know.
Yeah that's what we need.
What other money is there?
I don't know who it was.
All this time and I don't know it.
You're up first.
I think you know.
Do what you need to do.
I didn't get a good look.
What'd he look like?
That's a good thing?
Then why didn't they take it.
What do we do with him?
It was more than that.
I don't know are we?
It wasn't you.
Did you see him?
Only way to be.
Could be a lot more.
I'll be right up.
You got that right.
Tell him I'm not here!
Do you want some?
How should I know?
But what do I know?
That's just the way I am!
He's back there.
Do you want anything?
No it doesn't.
Where did you get that?
How about this one?
Why are we going here?
What should we do?
What's he doing now?
What's going on now?
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Why do I always have to do it?
I want to do him!
So what should we do?
You can have that one.
Just look at them!
How much is this?
Do you have my money?
Didn't they tell you?
I will if you want to.
Don't you like me?
So where would we go?
You know what we should do?
I mean you like me don't you?
Where did you get this?
In what way do you mean?
Does that mean you don't like me?
And you like them?
Well when can we do something?
Aren't you going to get that?
Yeah well you're not the only one.
You want me to do it?
We have to go in here!
Okay what about this one?
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Would you go out with her?
No you're not!
You're right about that.
Do you want to see it?
Is this one any good?
Did she say that?
Did she say anything to you about me?
Why wouldn't she tell me?
What did she tell you?
Don't thank me.
You're doing all the work.
As are they all.
How; we don't know where they are?
How could it be?
Can you do that?
Then why do it?
You never had it.
I wouldn't be in the way?
Don't much like them.
You think they'll come then?
I'll have to.
They know it's there.
Have you got it?
I don't really.
What did I do?
Now I don't know why.
You like him don't you?
Oh yes I think so.
Because they are here.
They will want a lot of money.
Do you need anything?
You want me to come in?
You know you are really doing very good work here.
Didn't I do it?
I think I do too.
Why do you say things like that?
You really weren't very good for me you know.
So what do I do now?
I'll put him down for you.
I think I should put him down now.
Or we could do that.
Were you on your way out?
You're really good you know.
Please don't say that.
Oh you think so?
Look I've had it with you.
Do they know you're doing this?
What are you doing up here?
I didn't mean to do that.
We'll be back.
Then why have you come?
What was will be what is will be no more.
You've got to do something!
That's all you have to say?
You were the one who got me in.
Do this for me.
That's where we come in.
I've been there.
I've had it with you.
Come up with anything?
Oh good you're here.
He's a mean one.
Don't you see?
Well don't think!
You coming down with something?
Have I done the right thing?
Now where are you going?
They're just coming to me.
You're very good.
I'm really tired.
Okay I'll help you.
Then I'll go.
What's in there?
So what do you think it was?
We'll get back to you.
One thing at a time.
Thank you for coming.
I want you to have this.
What's he want?
I want to know more about what you do here.
Why do you want to see it?
You could say that.
What's this one?
I don't like this.
Now what do you want?
He's here with me now.
Does she want to be?
It will be bad.
Didn't see anything Didn't get anything.
Did you see anything?
I couldn't help it!
Do you know when that might be?
I know what to do.
What do I say?
I can feel it.
You okay in there?
Now tell me what you really do.
What have I got now?
But I get what I want always don't I?
I have to come back.
You're coming back?
And don't tell me you don't know!
But have never been?
But that was something.
Isn't that right?
That's what I'm going to do.
They'll have me.
You're not going!
I'll do it!
Tell them I'll do it.
Just think about it!
That's one way to look at it.
You're in it!
Where did he do it?
Well what did he say?
How did he do it?
Why do you have to see him?
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would work.
I have to go back now.
I don't see how we can.
What are you going to do now?
Don't you have it on?
I don't feel well.
You've got to tell me what she said.
I said I think it is.
I think it is.
Is it because I'm here?
I've never been to it.
Get out of here.
Would you like to come in?
No I couldn't.
I'm not like this.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I just want to tell you something.
Could you do it?
Do you know what you're going to do?
I want you out of here.
Because I don't like you.
But she's okay now.
What did you do to her?
But it's all right now.
What are you then?
If that's all right.
What have you done to her?
Well don't thank me because I want you to.
Well I wouldn't.
You don't have to say that.
But it's not.
Well I'm not.
That's it isn't it?
Because I think I know what they are.
But why shouldn't I?
Because I don't want you to.
I don't think we were the first.
How do you think.
Why did you do that?
Well how do you feel about him then?
What do you say to him?
There isn't any.
Do you really want me to?
Well what do you want to know about it.
Now we are going to do this thing.
Are you tired of it?
Who said it was my first time?
It is isn't it?
It is your first time.
Is that all right?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
But there's one thing.
Why don't I get it?
Why don't you get it.
Do you want to get it now?
I'll get it.
Do you want me to get it?
I mean I could.
Do you want to?
He didn't see me.
I want to say something first.
I really don't want to put this on again.
I don't see why.
What if he did?
I don't think I should be up here.
Would you like to see it?
Because I like you.
I don't think of you that way.
I hadn't thought of it.
What do you think of me?
When is he coming back?
Will you come in please?
I got it all right.
I say I've got it.
They don't know?
Don't go on like this.
But I want you to.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Not if you don't want to.
Well I don't.
Why did you say that?
Then what do you do?
I want to tell you.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
She doesn't know about it.
That's what I'd do if I could.
Can you see me now?
And what are you going to do?
I'll do anything for you.
I'll get the money.
I will go with you.
I don't want them now.
Please look at me.
What can you see?
How tired you are!
Why do you look at me like that?
I am very tired.
What do you want here?
That was my last.
How do you feel now?
Then you know him?
Is that for me?
You'll have a good time with me.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Oh don't go.
Have you got it now?
And I said we didn't.
Yes yes they do.
cannot do that.
You haven't time.
Do you know the time?
But when did he go?
I know these people.
What do you want with her?
No one would have thought it of me.
Well you can tell them I said they're right.
You really think so?
Well that's nice.
Please come out of it.
Come take a look.
So here we are!
I don't see how you do it.
You know who I work for.
He's going to be all right!
I have only one thing now.
That's what we'll do then.
What do I have to do to get it?
) That's what it is isn't it?
Oh that's it!
I don't see why not.
But that's the way I am you know the way I've always been.
I know just how bad I was.
I didn't know anything was.
No you wouldn't.
You still got time.
What you do with it is up to you.
You do if you're where I am.
Where you want to be.
You don't put up with that!
I should have been on it.
And you have to be.
What am I doing in here?
What I say is no.
That's what I say.
Don't I get any say in this?
I don't think I need it.
It's there now.
This is time out.
And a good one I think.
I don't see why you're still here.
No more than this?
It this all we have?
That's that then.
Yes I know I know.
You up to it now?
Well I'm back now.
We never know when and we never know why.
We never know how.
Well when you put it that way.
Why am I here?
Doesn't look good.
Do you know who did this?
Don't think so.
What more do you want?
I'll come out.
Then you come out here.
Where'd you get it?
It could have been.
I know you think that.
And how were things?
Haven't got one.
I'm like this.
I don't know what I hope.
What'll I do?
You thank her for me.
No no no no no.
Oh no no no no no.
It isn't there any more.
What's good about that?
Because it always does.
You hope this too?
Tell him to come here.
That's really what you want.
I don't do them well.
And no one's there now?
You don't know you want.
You know what I want?
I was I was.
What's that all about?
I hope he can.
How do you do.
Not here not here.
Have it your way.
It's time it's time.
You'll like it there.
Don't you know how much I like you?
Is that the same thing?
We have have we?
Would you say that again?
You've got to get out right now!
Will you please go?
You'll have to go.
There was so much going on.
You don't know?
I don't really know him.
Do I have to?
Why didn't you say so?
What does he say to do?
You know who this is?
Where will you be?
A lot of people don't.
You're going out?
He said one other thing.
It wasn't very nice.
It's really that bad?
I think that's what he'd do.
They're in there!
Or when I'm in there there's me in there.
Why would you do that?
This is very good for us.
Don't you know who I am?
You help me I'll help you.
You're going to thank me for this.
doing your work for you?
Do you know her?
She's out back.
You have to tell me where he is.
Really I don't.
I mean about her coming back.
They are the same.
Then why be good?
No please go on.
Yeah yeah go on.
What does he do?
But it's all you do.
How did you get to be the way you are?
Is that the way it was with you?
Now does that make me as good as you?
It's not good for you.
You want to go out and get something?
When you get out we'll go.
How much do you make?
Do you know where she would be?
I don't really do this.
I wasn't in it.
Does she know anything about this?
Don't do anything more.
You've got to tell me.
Things you don't want to know about.
You like this don't you.
There's not much you can do here.
Look I do this a lot.
No I didn't think she was.
Well what do they know?
Tell them anything you want.
You don't want to know.
What is going on?
Just do what I say.
They don't know.
I'll do anything you want.
You can do anything you want to me.
Really thought she was good.
She's with you.
They're all about the same.
What we got is just these here.
That's what I did.
What does that do?
He didn't look good at all.
He wouldn't say what.
Well that's all right.
It's all about what's going on.
Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Oh I don't have one.
Tell me what do you see?
You're the first.
I think we can come up with something.
Well don't go.
Well why don't you?
This is really nice.
Yes so do I.
I think I see it.
Oh it's all right.
Yes you're right.
Because they are all the same.
You look as if you could.
I don't have the time.
Thank you but I really have to go.
Oh so do I.
What will people say?
What do you know about her?
Where does she come from?
I had to give it up.
What would you say?
How do you feel about that?
And a lot of time.
Something for them to look up to.
You'll need one of these.
I'll get him back.
And I'm not the only one.
How does he know so much about me?
Got tired of me?
We'll come back for you.
That's what you do.
That's why we need you.
That you feel that way about me.
It'll go in.
And you to us.
Do you know who did this to you?
Take it from me.
What CAN you do?
I need more of the same.
What do you want me to do.
Just help will you?
It's really me.
Tell me who you are.
I said: don't look.
Don't look at me.
Well can I come in or not?
What was there to see?
Come with me then.
Can I get you anything?
He's BEEN here.
It's ONE of these.
You know you are.
Why don't you do the same?
Yeah why don't I?
Well isn't it?
I have to get out.
I want to see.
You don't like her at all do you?
I'll be nice.
No it's good to see you.
What do we do if there isn't?
You're not going?
That's what we want.
You couldn't be.
What is she doing?
Yeah you would say that wouldn't you?
How do you know about that?
I never thought I would say this but can I go work now?
Can I have it then?
I'll do one.
Is now a good time?
You can say what you like.
Can I do anything?
Yeah but more than that.
Here she's here and now!
Well I'll just make it for you.
Didn't think about it really.
You had no right.
And I still do and you don't.
How were we the same people?
Look we're okay now.
We just had a nice time.
What it was like.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Look we can do other things.
I didn't mean that.
When are you going back?
I don't want to go back.
Look I don't want to take up any more of your time.
I can see why you say that.
I've got too much to do.
Look are you coming or not?
Do you want me to be there?
Well think about it.
I don't know these people.
Is that the last of it?
Don't need to.
Think about what I said.
I do not know.
I know what you're like.
I work too you know.
Only because it's never the time.
But is this really the time?
They don't know him.
And so it is.
Or would you like them on?
Don't you like that?
Where did she go?
But that's it.
You don't have to tell him what you got.
Don't know about any of that.
I'm the last.
Will I see you again?
It's all the same.
What is it like?
There is something more.
I don't know any of these.
But that's where you come in.
Not all of them.
What's all that?
What will you do now?
I think you do.
What's all of this got to do with me?
But there's more.
What are you going to tell them?
That's my right.
I think he's got something to do with it.
I'll be back when I can.
That is not me.
You do not know what time can do.
Some like you and he have more.
And you will be good I can feel that.
In this I can help.
Then they were right.
It is as you are.
You know this you can feel it.
You feel you know me.
You are the same?
How can you know this?
I did at that.
But not from you.
What would you like?
It's all we have.
We need more time.
Then it is time two of us did.
This isn't done.
I want you to come to me.
All I need is time.
You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
How would you like to work for me?
I should say not!
I got it back.
Did you give her the money?
Oh she was here.
How'd you get out?
Yes wasn't it?
That's right here.
I've done it.
Have you got that money?
But I like it that way.
Oh it isn't like that.
Take a look will you?
What does she look like?
I should thank you.
Well I got to get back.
That'll be nice.
Then who are you?
Get out of here you!
No you don't!
Well we'll see about that.
That's what I am.
I know what it's going to be like.
That's what he said the last time.
Then why are you doing it?
I'm not doing it for you!
Will you come here?
What are you doing there?
You know I would.
What'll I tell him?
What will be will be.
What did you do with her?
Is he coming back here?
How much do you want on it?
They'll see him.
That's all you are.
I'd like to think.
Where is he I said.
Well I'm coming to it.
You'll get it.
That's not my money!
You see what I had to put up with?
How do you like that?
Now you got me.
Then what does he want with you?
Is he as good as you say?
Wouldn't do any good.
He does does he?
Don't do it for me!
Might just as well be.
If you have to you have to.
And so will you.
Well go on and take it.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Just what I said.
Don't tell me what to do!
Now that's a nice thing to say.
Oh yes I would.
You know you did!
Who do you want?
You know what I mean?
A lot of money.
That might be all right.
No I tell you!
We know what you're up to.
Now where is he?
Is that any good?
I don't know anything I tell you.
Same way you did.
No I couldn't do that.
And so do I!
I was just going to!
Yes I'll be right out there.
Well I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now do as I tell you.
Now what do you say?
I'll take it.
Yes she's still here.
I thought so too.
You know it is!
Come on with that money!
You don't have to go with me at all!
What good'll it do?
You see that don't you?
No no you're right.
Are you all right now?
I'll be right here.
They'll get him!
We've got to do something!
You know where they are?
They wouldn't take it.
No I don't think so.
Who do you think!
Yes I did just now.
How do you like that.
We want to see you.
Want to go out on it?
I only know one.
Well go on then.
Yes she did didn't she?
No she didn't.
That's what they do when they know how.
He's never going to come back.
I don't think it's right.
It's not the same.
I did see them.
You do you do.
I don't know?
I will if you will!
There is all right.
We've been had.
You thought you did.
What did we know?
What are you going to be then?
We don't know anything about it
And it was the last.
We didn't know that.
He said I was right.
I want him so much.
And where do you think you're going?
And you never did.
I know you mean well.
Yeah I'll do something.
You shouldn't a done that.
Can I help you with something?
I'd like to see that.
But if you did.
Come on we need something like this.
What are you doing!
I'll just go.
What'd you see who was she with where were they going?
I'm not doing that.
I know but we can make it out of here.
We can do it.
We've got get out of here we got get out of here.
I don't want to see that.
Yeah well he's still here.
See if anything is out there.
She's up to something.
You said it not me.
Why are you doing this?
Well go get her.
Oh yeah you know about that?
And think about what you've done.
It's not so bad.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
You are all that too.
But you have something more.
We still have you and I.
You think too much.
I've got some things to tell you.
And I think I'm going to.
I don't get that.
But I'm not going to.
Look at you two.
So he's doing okay?
Should I come with?
Thank you very much for that.
And I want to help.
I could come work for you!
I'll make it.
You're what I want.
All I want is to be what you want.
It's really good.
I just have to know.
I really need this.
I have to think!
It's a lot of work.
Thank you so much.
I'll just go on my way.
You'll never see me again.
Yes that's something to think about.
That's very good.
All I want's the money.
That's the way it's done.
That's the way it's done isn't it?
I'll make it up to you.
You know what's good for him?
Yeah I think we do.
Bad for me bad for you.
But that wouldn't mean anything to you.
You want me to tell her for you?
I didn't think he did.
You know what you were doing?
Here I got it.
How good is he?
I don't know when it was.
Why back me then?
That's the only way.
It's good for you.
Only when I work.
Yeah that's right.
Don't take me with you.
That's what I want.
Yeah that's what I think.
Never been out of it.
I'll get you your money back.
It don't look good on you.
You're coming with me.
How much we got?
I don't want it.
No no more for me.
Just you and me.
Doesn't any of this mean anything to you?
When you feel like coming back you'll come back.
I need it the money.
Yes I want to know what for.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Look I'll be back.
What do you want to tell me?
Yes I need them very much.
Why'd I do it?
You don't have to look.
Why did he tell you?
He said I was.
Will you say that to me too?
Give it back to me.
Where do you get the money?
No why should I?
Oh it's not bad.
How do you like them?
You want to go with me?
Did you go out?
Well what do you want to know?
People come people go.
I like it to be what it is.
What do you do now?
That wouldn't give us much time would it?
That's right too.
Where do you come from?
You know how it is.
You have to go.
Have you always had it?
You're not them.
Do you want to go on?
It could help all of you.
If we want it it is.
But you'll like it where we're going.
Do we have to?
Is that all he said?
We've got to get help.
Don't go in.
But we have to see.
No but it was here.
I don't see anything.
Can you tell me about that?
Do you like it here?
You always like that don't you.
Well come on you two.
I really don't know much about them.
I couldn't get a thing out of him.
We're going with you.
I mean we're going too.
It's really nice of you to help us.
Then get them out of there.
I don't know how you put up with him.
What'd I say?
This I can see.
Why wouldn't he?
You can do that?
They don't know this.
You think they don't know what you know?
How're we doing?
It's doing what?
Didn't want to say anything.
It's good money.
I didn't take it.
I don't need it.
What do you want us to do?
Where do your people come from?
Why did you people come here?
But where are we going?
I'll tell him we'll take two.
You've got it!
Look what you did!
But don't you see?
You could be more right than you know.
Where did this come from?
Is that what you think of me?
I think he's in here.
You like the way I do things.
Now who are all these people?
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm here now.
What did you get?
Oh yes she did.
But what are they?
Do what I do.
You didn't did you?
If only I could have been with you.
But I thought you were one of them.
We've got to get out of here.
But what are you doing here?
You don't like him do you?
To get you here?
We say we will not.
There's got to be another way out.
What're we going to do?
You're all right now.
I'm going down.
He'll be okay.
What'd he say now?
What're we going to do?!
You don't look very good.
I'll get us out of here.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I know it's no good.
How do we get out?
There's a lot you don't know.
It's just money.
She's going with us?
I know she's not with them.
That's what you're good at.
That's what I'll do!
What will you do.
What do you hope?
And you got no one to help you.
And you know what I'll do?
It's not your time.
And on my time.
Oh you were right.
What'd you get out of her?
They're all in it.
I don't know what's going on.
Other than her there's no one here I know.
I can see out!
But what's it look like?
Now where would I be?
Help me out will you?
I don't want to be you.
You'll be me.
Oh yeah to what?
They'll know who I am.
I don't have any.
Where did he get you?
To get out of here.
They don't really need us.
They know I'm in here.
What does it say.
We have to get out of here.
What do you mean we.
I'll tell you what to say.
Don't do it.
Then how'd I get here?
What'd I do?
I just got here.
It wasn't him.
I know you did!
You know what I hope?
It's all we've got.
You didn't say it right.
Aren't we all.
Then how did you know?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
He work for us?
I'll get him out of here.
What about these people?
What do we do with them?
What are you doing here where've you been?
It is to me too.
I don't know Who.
Don't you want to get out?
Couldn't help it.
Now you know what I know.
I didn't say anything.
You said something first.
But you did it.
I'm no good at this.
Who do you work for?
I'll come back for you.
Why not what are you going to do?
Why did you then?
You can say that again.
That I really don't know.
What did you tell them?
What did they do?
This going to work?
You've been there?
It's back the other way.
You think I'm like that?
What's he done?
No he didn't do that.
Did he put you up to it?
There's not much to tell.
I had to go with them.
And you what do you like?
No one at all.
And how'm I doing?
If I was with you I wouldn't
You mean from it.
I'll be right there.
What do you do about what?
Why are you on to him?
He didn't do anything.
Could I have it please.
What does he know?
I'll take a look at what you got.
What do you mean what's it do?
Not on any of it.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Then what are you going to do?
Well what do you think I'm going to do?
I'm not going to do that.
But oh no not you.
I can take her.
No you do not.
How do you want to do it?
Yes I'm right here.
I'm going to tell you why.
You want to know why?
Did I get you up?
Now you tell me.
You think about that.
You think about them.
Oh you know what we do or do not need to know?
To think about it.
I could be anything.
If you want to do it.
Where do you work?
I know what I have to know.
Are they doing it?
All of us did.
When should we do this?
What did you want to see me about?
But I don't know.
Got one right here.
Why do you think she did it?
So am I right?
You don't like me?
No we're not!
You're right about me.
No that's not all.
I know you do.
Why would you be here?
He was right wasn't he?
So where are you now?
Well what does he want?
You thought she had money.
She's here now.
And it's good!
Do I get it?
Yes I know but
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!
I'll be going.
Are you going to see him?
Well what are we going to do about it?
It'll do no good.
I don't know very much about him.
You know how I feel about him.
Just the way I like it.
I'll never thank you!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
You'll never do it!
That what You'll have.
You know I'm going to have my way.
Do anything you want!
And there's one more thing I don't want!
That's to see you.
If you really mean it I will.
Will you do that?
Well you can help now.
What would you like to have me do?
She's been too much for me.
You never can tell.
I don't like you!
What do they say?
She doesn't want it.
Why didn't I think of it?
The only one I've got.
It's okay with me.
What do you think you're doing!
I hope you got your money.
They don't come that way any more.
Haven't you thought about it at all?
Come on get in.
What're you going to do?
A lot of people do it
I only work when I have to.
I don't want it now.
I didn't give him anything .
Why haven't you ?
There you go again!
You don't know how to do it.
You're doing all right.
It's all right with me.
All right I'm here to help you.
How's your's?
What do you mean
I didn't do it for you.
I never thought of that.
Why no I Yes .
No I've got that all right.
What am I going to do now?
Don't know what they want.
No it isn't.
Want to see me?
Do you think they'd see me?
It's up to you now.
No time to think.
Why he'll be back.
Isn't he here?
Who do you think she was?
Might as well give up.
Come on come on!
Yeah where am I?
But that's the way things go.
I've got to get right back.
Well I'll be
It's all right here.
This is something you got to do for me.
Well I got one now.
Well you got one now.
He couldn't take it.
How do I know?
You know too much.
I didn't know it was anything like this see and
Yeah wouldn't it?
Well you're two up on me now.
I don't know how they got to me.
I mean you really are.
That's what I'm here for.
Do you know what you've done to me?
You know what you've done to me?
You think we want that?
Yeah you got it.
Oh you got that?
Oh yes well come to think of it they're right.
No it was not.
As you well know.
I am - I am.
I don't know what to tell them.
You were there why didn't you say something?
What are you doing in here?
We need him back.
I said all I'm going to say.
But he was there all right.
Here take a look at it.
He'll never make it.
I just don't want to do it.
And what would I have to do?
That's all you've had all this time?
Can you take me with you?
But the only way to help you was to do that so I did it.
I need help and you can help me.
You were there for me.
How'd you know where he was?
Why were you with him?
What time do you have to be there?
What's she want?
He wouldn't say.
Can you do it or not?
You don't want much do you?
Help us do what?
What's in it?
This is your money?
Where're you going?
I didn't say you did.
He'll like that.
Tell him you want to see him?
It'll be more than that.
And is that it?
No I mean you right now.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Does she know that?
What're you up to?
How'd you feel about it?
So I did something about it.
It's not really something I think about.
How do you get it out?
It's a lot of money.
No you didn't.
What did they want to know?
You're not tired of it?
Who do you think I am?
You want to think about it?
And we have you.
I didn't see him.
You didn't tell me how to do that did you?
She didn't give me one.
Because I didn't have it.
But you didn't do that.
If I did I'd have to give you one wouldn't I?
Or we could take what we want.
It doesn't look like that much.
You said that the last time.
Who's the other one?
How can you help us?
Oh so now you know him?
You know what we want.
Now tell me what can we do for you?
Do you got something for me?
Yeah do you like it?
He said he didn't know about it.
Only that it's money.
If I wasn't this wouldn't work.
How do you know she did that?
I can do that.
What did they say?
Okay you got it.
I should get out of here?
I never got to know him really.
So where did you go?
I didn't really think anything of it.
If she's got it why didn't she take it all?
How much it there?
Well if you had to do it you had to do it.
You know how she is.
When I see you.
Did you get it?
What did he do?
I know you don't know.
That's good money.
Now tell me where my money's at.
In a way yes.
Well give it to me then.
Is that what I think it is?
I just don't got it on me.
Why would I tell you anything?
What does she do for you?
I get my money back don't I?
You think you could do that?
Who's it for?
What do you need me for?
You have it with you?
You know it's for you.
Get me out of here.
Well how do I look?
Just to see you.
You want to see me?
Well here I am.
Do you want some help?
What is it about us?
They've done something to us.
How can you not want to know?
I don't know if I can.
Did he say anything?
Something's going on here.
You've got to do something.
What'd he say that for?
You can do it.
Well I'll see what I can do about it.
That'd be a first.
I had to get in there.
What did you do to me?
Only we didn't make it.
You should go back to her.
That's about all she said.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She's like you that way.
What did she have to say?
But I see them.
We don't need them.
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't want them.
I need to see him.
Look I need to see him.
It'll just take some time.
It's the only one I had.
You know who I am.
I haven't done a thing.
You can have anything you want.
What'd you do that for?
Who do you think you are?
Well I've had it.
It's going to be all right.
I've got you now.
What are you doing to me?
It's not right for you or me.
I'm not here.
It might be for me.
I can do anything I want.
It's just me.
That's all he said.
He said you didn't have one.
That's what I want to know.
That's what they say when they don't know what it is.
What's in here?
And look what I got.
Yeah but for what?
What could I say?
It's on me.
Well that's good to know.
You know it's okay.
You know that time.
What are they like?
I mean do what you think is right.
So what do you think we should do?
I don't really know anything about it.
Well there we have it.
You don't know anything about me!
I don't know I just did.
Come on I have something for you.
I want to have it.
You don't have to do that.
Why aren't you at work?
Then what's going on?
Look if I could give it to you now I would.
I didn't know he had it in him!
Well it's not.
He did it with you.
You don't make anything.
What do you make with that?
What's that thing?
Some of us are.
There's just things I still want to do.
What would be a good time for you?
Can you see it?
No it is not!
Thank you for what?
Yeah but what is it?
What'll we do out there?
Now why is that?
It didn't work.
Why what did he do?
Because I was there.
So how's it going?
How much do you want?
You give them money.
That's just it.
Why you give money.
Why I do what?
But that's the thing.
Can I do it?
The way I see it.
You were the one.
But I didn't really want her to.
That would be good.
But I mean more like.
It's like all I think about now.
Well how was it?
Don't look for him.
I like you so much.
I just like you.
It'll be nice.
What's all this?
Because you know why.
What do I want to do?
You know what I want to do?
I don't feel so well.
Now that's it.
Do you want to come make out with me?
We'll work it out.
And it's like.
I was like yes!
I'm going out with him!
You know what it's like.
You know if you look at it.
No it wasn't.
You think I'm right?
What do you mean no?
Oh we'll be back.
I don't like you.
You know give him something to do.
You want me to what?
wouldn't have it.
I don't know but I think you're right.
It isn't him.
He was with me?
Where did you go!
I know where you are.
I'll give you anything you want.
It is her I want.
It's me you want.
No you haven't.
Who would you tell?
I hadn't thought of that.
I couldn't tell you that.
I know what I said!
But you said you didn't know her.
You're not going to tell me that.
If you got something to say to me just come out and say it!
Did you know her?
I haven't got time for this.
I had to make it right.
Why did he what?
He wouldn't come here.
What could I do?
Did he say something?
That's only because you don't know where to go.
What do you like?
He should be right back.
Would you like come in?
What are you doing up?
Not that I can see.
Why don't you go out there.
You want to know what I think?
What time did he get there?
What do you think he did?
What'd he do?
Look I'll do anything you want!
That's got to be it.
We'll take it from here.
You want me to go with you?
Did they get him?
What do you see here?
You have something you want to say?
What are they please?
Yes here it is.
Why they're all the same?
Could you look and tell me what they are?
It could be anything.
If I have to.
What do you want on it?
I know you didn't
I know it was bad.
Because I work with them.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
Oh but it is.
I don't think I could.
What if she isn't?
We need your help.
Is this your first time here?
No I want you to do good.
We are coming for you.
I don't know how.
I will be with you.
I couldn't help it.
You will do as I tell you.
You cannot know that!
I can feel it!
There is no other way.
You will know in good time.
They will help us.
There's no way down.
You have done it?
You will not then?
I don't think that.
Now what do you have to give us?
I only want one.
He will not come.
He will come for me.
It is the time.
It is the time then.
You will come with me.
It will not help.
Why do you want to know?
Come on tell me!
Good what are you going to do?
Do you come back?
And I didn't say anything I said I don't know you.
I don't know any.
I should do something.
Do you need money?
We'll go where you want!
I don't want to go!
I don't want!
We'll get out I tell you!
Don't you like it?
Come on get down!
How did you do it?
How can you say it?
What if you don't make it?
It's what I'm going to do.
What would you like us to do?
Were you there to help her?
I'll take that as a no.
To me it is.
Did she tell you that?
You're not going up there.
I feel so bad for her.
Is he the only one?
Okay how would it work?
Did she do that to you too?
Like all the time?
I don't know anything any more!
You know how you get.
You're here now.
You're not here to see me?
I feel that too.
I like well what I see.
What do you want with me?
An' how you do it?
Why should he do that?
There isn't much time!
I should hope not!
What did it say?
Want to see me do it?
And who might that be?
What does she want from me?
And if I cannot?
Didn't you now?
I don't want it on me.
Tell me one thing more.
What's this now?
Oh but I have.
You do know where it is?
He was there and then he wasn't!
There's not much to do there.
I mean it's all work.
Who are all these people?
I couldn't get it to go down.
I put him to work.
What did you think it would be?
Did you feel anything?
I don't like any of it.
I thought you said he was?
I mean I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
I don't want you to!
I'm coming in.
I'll get your back.
I didn't know you were there.
I did tell you didn't I?
What are you on?
She didn't really say.
I want you in me now!
He's going back in.
I never said anything.
I haven't done anything.
What would you be doing now?
So I didn't.
What do you know about me?
What are you now?
What I'm not.
What would you like to be?
Not here with me.
When are you going to be back?
You'll have money when you work for it.
I'm not doing it!
I want you here.
You'll have money when you work.
I need some money.
Can I take you out?
I'm not going!
Why would you be there?
What would you do?
Do you know what I'd give to have this!
You need to know what?
He's not there!
And when he is he isn't!
What is it with this?
Do you need help?
The first and the last.
I did say he could go.
I want him with me.
Where he always is.
You got the money?
I mean he really is.
I'd be you.
I'll make you something.
You don't look like you.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I just thought it would be nice.
Want me to come back some other time?
I'm in here.
You look just like she said.
I really shouldn't.
And what will we do when we get there?
That's the way it is.
Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
You got us out!
Does that mean I'm in?
I think we can make it.
What do I want?
No I don't like it here.
There is no we.
There is a me there is a you.
I think we can do this.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
I want to be one of them.
I want you to be one of them.
Why didn't you take it?
What do you think about that?
You need it more than I do.
Well this is all I can give you.
I'm going in for him.
He'd do the same for me.
You'll never make it!
Something like that yes.
I can get more.
What does that say about me?
It's so nice to see all of you here.
You shouldn't have come here.
That's what I thought!
Yeah get out of here!
