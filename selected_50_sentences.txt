I think that the client is in litigation
When will we get the schedule for my client
My client will confirm the schedule with you
So can you get the point now
That is what we do for you
They did not confirm the schedule with us
I think that it is not your case
I do not know if they will do it
You and I are in the trial
I think there is exposure in this litigation
So I can get your signature
But they did not confirm it
What do we know about the case now
Yes I will get them on the trial schedule
No there is no exposure for us in this appeal
Confirm with the judge if there is no trial
Yes I will confirm your case with them
When will the judge confirm the appeal for the client
But I do not know the schedule for the trial
It is about the exposure in this case
I do not think the client is on trial
I think there is no exposure for the client
I will confirm if you can do it
But the case is not on trial now
Yes I will get your signature and confirm it
So I think there is exposure for it
The judge did not get your point in the trial
I do not know if it is there
Do you know when they will schedule it
We have to confirm the signature for the client
No we can not do it for now
Do you know when we can get it
I do not know if it is for us
We think the case is not about exposure
They did not get the signature in the trial
But I did not think about that
The point is to have them there
We will do it if you confirm
We have to think about litigation
I do not know if you did it
I do not know what that is
We are in litigation on that point
If you think it is the case you can confirm
Do you know when they will get it
They have exposure in this case
We do not know if it is the case
The client and I will get on that
But we think it is not for us
We can do it now if you confirm
Yes I think they are in the trial schedule
