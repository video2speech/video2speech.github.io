I do not know what you think
But the case is not on trial now
So I think there is exposure for it
Yes I will get them on the trial schedule
They did not confirm the schedule with us
But we think it is not for us
The judge did not get your point in the trial
What do we know about the case now
Do you know when they will schedule it
But I do not know the schedule for the trial
No we can not do it for now
But we are not in trial
No there is no exposure for us in this appeal
So can you get my point now
We can confirm the schedule with them
We are in litigation on that point
But they did not confirm it
I will confirm if you can do it
They did not get the signature for the trial
I think that the client is in litigation
We do not know if it is the case
I do not think the client is on trial
I do not know if it is for us
We can do it now if you confirm
The judge will get this point in the trial
We have to confirm the signature for the client
I do not know if it is there
I think there is no exposure for the client
Yes I will get your signature and confirm it
Do you know when they will get it
We have to think about litigation exposure
We do know what they did
Do you know when we can get it
The client and I will get on that
Confirm with the judge if there is no trial
Yes I think they are in the trial schedule
When will you and I get this
My client will confirm the schedule with you
I do not know when you can get it
I do not know if you did it
I think that it is not your case
We think the case is not about exposure
That is what we do for you
I think there is exposure in this litigation
Yes I will confirm your case with them
When will the judge get the appeal
It is about the exposure in this case
When will we get the schedule for my client
I do not know if they will do it
If you think it is the case you can confirm
